Monopole and Dyon Solutions in AdS space
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider monopole and dyon classical solutions of the Yang-Mills-Higgs
system coupled to gravity in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. We discuss
both singular and regular solutions to the second order equations of motion
showing that singular Wu-Yang like dyons can be found, the resulting metric
being of the Reissner-N\"ordstrom type (with cosmological constant). Concerning
regular solutions, we analyze the conditions under which they can be
constructed discussing, for vanishing coupling constant, the main distinctive
features related to the anti-de Sitter asymptotic condition; in particular, we
find in this case that the v.e.v. of the Higgs scalar, $|\vec H(\infty)|$,
should be quantized in units of the natural mass scale $1/e r_0$ (related to
the cosmological constant) according to $|\vec H(\infty)|^2 = m(m+1) (e r_0
)^{-2}$, with $m \in Z$.
