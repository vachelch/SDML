Bianchi IX Self-dual Einstein Metrics and Singular G_2 Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct explicit cohomogeneity two metrics of G_2 holonomy, which are
foliated by twistor spaces. The twistor spaces are S^2 bundles over
four-dimensional Bianchi IX Einstein metrics with self-dual (or anti-self-dual)
Weyl tensor. Generically the 4-metric is of triaxial Bianchi IX type, with
SU(2) isometry. We derive the first-order differential equations for the metric
coefficients, and obtain the corresponding superpotential governing the
equations of motion, in the general triaxial Bianchi IX case. In general our
metrics have singularities, which are of orbifold or cosmic-string type. For
the special case of biaxial Bianchi IX metrics, we give a complete analysis
their local and global properties, and the singularities. In the triaxial case
we find that a system of equations written down by Tod and Hitchin satisfies
our first-order equations. The converse is not always true. A discussion is
given of the possible implications of the singularity structure of these spaces
for M-theory dynamics.
