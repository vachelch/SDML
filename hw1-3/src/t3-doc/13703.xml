Compactifications of F-Theory on Calabi-Yau Threefolds at Constant
  Coupli ng
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalizing the work of Sen, we analyze special points in the moduli space
of the compactification of the F-theory on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau
threefolds where the coupling remains constant. These contain points where
they can be realized as orbifolds of six torus $T^6$ by $Z_m \times Z_n (m,
n=2, 3, 4, 6)$. At various types of intersection points of singularities, we
find that the enhancement of gauge symmetries arises from the intersection of
two kinds of singularities. We also argue that when we take the Hirzebruch
surface as a base for the Calabi- Yau threefold, the condition for constant
coupling corresponds to the case where the point like instantons coalesce,
giving rise to enhanced gauge group of $Sp(k)$.
