Quasinormal modes of Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m Anti-de Sitter Black
  Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Complex frequencies associated with quasinormal modes for large
Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m Anti-de Sitter black holes have been computed.
These frequencies have close relation to the black hole charge and do not
linearly scale with the black hole temperature as in Schwarzschild Anti-de
Sitter case. In terms of AdS/CFT correspondence, we found that the bigger the
black hole charge is, the quicker for the approach to thermal equilibrium in
the CFT. The properties of quasinormal modes for $l>0$ have also been studied.
