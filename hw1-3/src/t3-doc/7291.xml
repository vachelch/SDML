<title>
The Master Ward Identity and Generalized Schwinger-Dyson Equation in
  Classical Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of perturbative quantum field theory a new, universal
renormalization condition (called Master Ward Identity) was recently proposed
by one of us (M.D.) in a joint paper with F.-M. Boas. The main aim of the
present paper is to get a better understanding of the Master Ward Identity by
analyzing its meaning in classical field theory. It turns out that it is the
most general identity for classical local fields which follows from the field
equations. It is equivalent to a generalization of the Schwinger-Dyson Equation
and is closely related to the Quantum Action Principle of Lowenstein and Lam.
  The validity of the Master Ward Identity makes possible a local construction
of quantum gauge theories.
  As a byproduct we complete Peierls' manifestly covariant definition of the
Poisson bracket.
