Moduli Stabilization from Fluxes in a Simple IIB Orientifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We study novel type IIB compactifications on the T^6/Z_2 orientifold. This
geometry arises in the T-dual description of Type I theory on T^6, and one
normally introduces 16 space-filling D3-branes to cancel the RR tadpoles. Here,
we cancel the RR tadpoles either partially or fully by turning on three-form
flux in the compact geometry. The resulting (super)potential for moduli is
calculable. We demonstrate that one can find many examples of N=1
supersymmetric vacua with greatly reduced numbers of moduli in this system. A
few examples with N>1 supersymmetry or complete supersymmetry breaking are also
discussed.
