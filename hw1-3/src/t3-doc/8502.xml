Type IIA Supergravity Excitations in Plane-Wave Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the low-lying excitations of Type IIA superstring theory in a plane
wave background with 24 supersymmetries. In the light-cone gauge, the
superstring action has {\cal N}=(4,4) supersymmetry and is exactly solvable
since it is quadratic in superstring coordinates. We obtain explicitly the
spectrum of the Type IIA supergravity fluctuation modes in the plane wave
background and give its correspondence with the spectrum of string states from
the zero-mode sector of the light-cone superstring Hamiltonian.
