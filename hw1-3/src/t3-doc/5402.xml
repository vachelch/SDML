D-brane Configurations and Nicolai Map in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some properties of a supersymmetric matrix model that is the
dimensional reduction of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in ten dimensions and
which has been recently argued to represent the short-distance structure of M
theory in the infinite momentum frame. We describe a reduced version of the
matrix quantum mechanics and derive the Nicolai map of the simplified
supersymmetric matrix model. We use this to argue that there are no phase
transitions in the large-N limit, and hence that S-duality is preserved in the
full eleven dimensional theory.
