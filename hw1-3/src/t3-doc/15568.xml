Information Loss and Anomalous Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  The approach of 't Hooft to the puzzles of black hole evaporation can be
applied to a simpler system with analogous features. The system is $1+1$
dimensional electrodynamics in a linear dilaton background. Analogues of black
holes, Hawking radiation and evaporation exist in this system. In perturbation
theory there appears to be an information paradox but this gets resolved in the
full quantum theory and there exists an exact $S$-matrix, which is fully
unitary and information conserving. 't Hooft's method gives the leading terms
in a systematic approximation to the exact result.
