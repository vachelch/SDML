<title>
Irreducible Hamiltonian BRST symmetry for reducible first-class systems
</title>

<abstract>
  An irreducible Hamiltonian BRST quantization method for reducible first-class
systems is proposed. The general theory is illustrated on a two-stage reducible
model, the link with the standard reducible BRST treatment being also
emphasized.
