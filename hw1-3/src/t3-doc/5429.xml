Compactifications of Heterotic Theory on Non-Kahler Complex Manifolds: I
</title>

<abstract>
  We study new compactifications of the SO(32) heterotic string theory on
compact complex non-Kahler manifolds. These manifolds have many interesting
features like fewer moduli, torsional constraints, vanishing Euler character
and vanishing first Chern class, which make the four-dimensional theory
phenomenologically attractive. We take a particular compact example studied
earlier and determine various geometrical properties of it. In particular we
calculate the warp factor and study the sigma model description of strings
propagating on these backgrounds. The anomaly cancellation condition and
enhanced gauge symmetry are shown to arise naturally in this framework, if one
considers the effect of singularities carefully.
  We then give a detailed mathematical analysis of these manifolds and
construct a large class of them. The existence of a holomorphic (3,0) form is
important for the construction. We clarify some of the topological properties
of these manifolds and evaluate the Betti numbers. We also determine the
superpotential and argue that the radial modulus of these manifolds can
actually be stabilized.
