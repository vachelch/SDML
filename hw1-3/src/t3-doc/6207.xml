Running with the Radius in RS1
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a renormalization group formalism for the Randall-Sundrum scenario,
where the renormalization scale is set by a floating compactification radius.
While inspired by the AdS/CFT conjecture, our results are derived concretely
within higher-dimensional effective field theory. Matching theories with
different radii leads to running hidden brane couplings. The hidden brane
Lagrangian consists of four-dimensional local operators constructed from the
induced value of the bulk fields on the brane. We find hidden Lagrangians which
are non-trivial fixed points of the RG flow. Calculations in RS1 can be greatly
simplified by ``running down'' the effective theory to a small radius. We
demonstrate these simplifications by studying the Goldberger-Wise stabilization
mechanism. In this paper, we focus on the classical and tree-level quantum
field theory of bulk scalar fields, which demonstrates the essential features
of the RG in the simplest context.
