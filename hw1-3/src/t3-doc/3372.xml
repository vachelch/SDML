Anomalies on Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the form of the chiral anomaly on an S1/Z2 orbifold with chiral
boundary conditions. We find that the 4-divergence of the higher-dimensional
current evaluated at a given point in the extra dimension is proportional to
the probability of finding the chiral zero mode there. Nevertheless the
anomaly, appropriately defined as the five dimensional divergence of the
current, lives entirely on the orbifold fixed planes and is independent of the
shape of the zero mode. Therefore long distance four dimensional anomaly
cancellation ensures the consistency of the higher dimensional orbifold theory.
