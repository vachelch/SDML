Softly Broken N=1 Supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We study softly broken N=1 supersymmetric QCD with the gauge group $SU(N_c)$
and $N_f$ flavours of quarks for $N_f > N_c+1$. We investigate the phase
structure of its dual theory adding generic soft supersymmetry breking terms,
i.e. soft scalar masses, trilinear coupling terms of scalar fields and gaugino
masses. It is found that the trilinear coupling terms play an improtant role in
determining the potential minima. Also we compare softly broken original and
dual theories in the broken phase.
