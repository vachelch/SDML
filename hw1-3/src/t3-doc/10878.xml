Pre-Big Bang Cosmology and Quantum Fluctuations
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum fluctuations of a homogeneous, isotropic, open pre-big bang model
are discussed. By solving exactly the equations for tensor and scalar
perturbations we find that particle production is negligible during the
perturbative Pre-Big Bang phase.
