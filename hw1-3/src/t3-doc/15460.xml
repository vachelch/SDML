Evaporating Black Holes and Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Hawking radiation for the geometry of an evaporating 1+1
dimensional black hole. We compute Bogoliubov coefficients and the stress
tensor. We use a recent result of Srednicki to estimate the entropy of
entanglement produced in the evaporation process, for the 1+1 dimensional hole
and for the 3+1 dimensional hole. It is found that the one space dimensional
result of Srednicki is the pertinent one to use, in both cases.
