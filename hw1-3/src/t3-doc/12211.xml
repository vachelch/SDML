<title>
A new bigravity model with exclusively positive branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new ``bigravity'' model with two positive tension AdS_4 branes
in AdS_5 bulk and no negative tension branes. The bounce of the ``warp'' factor
mimics the effect of a negative brane and thus gives rise to an anomalously
light graviton KK mode. This configuration satisfies the weak energy condition
and has no ghost state. In addition, the extra polarization states of the
massive graviton practically decouple and thus it does not contradict to
Einsteinian gravity. However, the model has certain phenomenological
difficulties associated with the presence of a negative cosmological constant
on the branes.
