Instantons, Monopoles and Toric HyperKaehler Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, the metric on the moduli space of the k=1 SU(n) periodic
instanton -or caloron- with arbitrary gauge holonomy at spatial infinity is
explicitly constructed. The metric is toric hyperKaehler and of the form
conjectured by Lee and Yi. The torus coordinates describe the residual
U(1)^{n-1} gauge invariance and the temporal position of the caloron and can
also be viewed as the phases of n monopoles that constitute the caloron. The
(1,1,..,1) monopole is obtained as a limit of the caloron. The calculation is
performed on the space of Nahm data, which is justified by proving the
isometric property of the Nahm construction for the cases considered. An
alternative construction using the hyperKaehler quotient is also presented. The
effect of massless monopoles is briefly discussed.
