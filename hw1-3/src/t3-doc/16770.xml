Who changes the string coupling ?
</title>

<abstract>
  In general bosonic closed string backgrounds the ghost-dilaton is not the
only state in the semi-relative BRST cohomology that can change the
dimensionless string coupling. This fact is used to establish complete dilaton
theorems in closed string field theory. The ghost-dilaton, however, is the
crucial state: for backgrounds where it becomes BRST trivial we prove that the
string coupling becomes an unobservable parameter of the string action. For
backgrounds where the matter CFT includes free uncompactified bosons we
introduce a refined BRST problem by including the zero-modes "x" of the bosons
as legal operators on the complex. We argue that string field theory can be
defined on this enlarged complex and that its BRST cohomology captures
accurately the notion of a string background. In this complex the ghost-dilaton
appears to be the only BRST-physical state changing the string coupling.
