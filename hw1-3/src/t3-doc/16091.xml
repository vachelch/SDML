*-Structures on Braided Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  $*$-structures on quantum and braided spaces of the type defined via an
R-matrix are studied. These include $q$-Minkowski and $q$-Euclidean spaces as
additive braided groups. The duality between the $*$-braided groups of vectors
and covectors is proved and some first applications to braided geometry are
made.
