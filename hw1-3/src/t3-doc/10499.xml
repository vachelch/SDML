BFT embedding of noncommutative D-brane system
</title>

<abstract>
  We study noncommutative geometry in the framework of the
Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin(BFT) scheme, which converts second class constraint
system into first class one. In an open string theory noncommutative geometry
appears due to the mixed boundary conditions having second class constraints,
which arise in string theory with $D$-branes under a constant Neveu-Schwarz
$B$-field. Introduction of a new coordinate $y$ on $D$-brane through BFT
analysis allows us to obtain the commutative geometry with the help of the
first class constraints, and the resulting action corresponding to the first
class Hamiltonian in the BFT Hamiltonian formalism has a new local symmetry.
