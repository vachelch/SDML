Supersymmetry Breaking and Duality in SU(N)xSU(N-M) Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a class of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, with gauge
group SU(N)xSU(N - M) and fundamental matter content. Duality plays an
essential role in analyzing the nonperturbative infrared dynamics of these
models. We find that Yukawa couplings drive these theories into the confining
phase, and show how the nonperturbative superpotentials arise in the dual
picture. We show that the odd-N, M = 2 models with an appropriate tree-level
superpotential break supersymmetry.
