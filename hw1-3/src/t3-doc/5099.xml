Local Systems of Vertex Operators, Vertex Superalgebras and Modules
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an analogue for vertex operator algebras and superalgebras of the
notion of endomorphism ring of a vector space by means of a notion of ``local
system of vertex operators'' for a (super) vector space. We first prove that
any local system of vertex operators on a (super) vector space $M$ has a
natural vertex (super)algebra structure with $M$ as a module. Then we prove
that for a vertex (operator) superalgebra $V$, giving a $V$-module $M$ is
equivalent to giving a vertex (operator) superalgebra homomorphism from $V$ to
some local system of vertex operators on $M$. As applications, we prove that
certain lowest weight modules for some well-known infinite-dimensional Lie
algebras or Lie superalgebras have natural vertex operator superalgebra
structures. We prove the rationality of vertex operator superalgebras
associated to standard modules for an affine algebra. We also give an analogue
of the notion of the space of linear homomorphisms from one module to another
for a Lie algebra by introducing a notion of ``generalized intertwining
operators.'' We prove that $G(M^{1},M^{2})$, the space of generalized
intertwining operators from one module $M^{1}$ to another module $M^{2}$ for a
vertex operator superalgebra $V$, is a generalized $V$-module. Furthermore, we
prove that for a fixed vertex operator superalgebra $V$ and
