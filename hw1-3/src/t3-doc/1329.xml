<title>
Affine Lie Algebras in Massive Field Theory and Form-Factors from Vertex
  Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new application of affine Lie algebras to massive quantum field
theory in 2 dimensions, by investigating the $q\to 1$ limit of the q-deformed
affine $\hat{sl(2)}$ symmetry of the sine-Gordon theory, this limit occurring
at the free fermion point. Working in radial quantization leads to a
quasi-chiral factorization of the space of fields. The conserved charges which
generate the affine Lie algebra split into two independent affine algebras on
this factorized space, each with level 1 in the anti-periodic sector, and level
$0$ in the periodic sector. The space of fields in the anti-periodic sector can
be organized using level-$1$ highest weight representations, if one supplements
the $\slh$ algebra with the usual local integrals of motion. Introducing a
particle-field duality leads to a new way of computing form-factors in radial
quantization. Using the integrals of motion, a momentum space bosonization
involving vertex operators is formulated. Form-factors are computed as vacuum
expectation values in momentum space. (Based on talks given at the Berkeley
Strings 93 conference, May 1993, and the III International Conference on
Mathematical Physics, String Theory, and Quantum Gravity, Alushta, Ukraine,
June 1993.)
