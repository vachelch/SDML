Wilson Lines and Classical Solutions in Cubic Open String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct exact classical solutions in cubic open string field theory. By
the redefinition of the string field, we find that the solutions correspond to
finite deformations of the Wilson lines. The solutions have well-defined Fock
space expressions, and they have no branch cut singularity of marginal
parameters which was found in the analysis using level truncation approximation
in Feynman-Siegel gauge. We also discuss marginal tachyon lump solutions at
critical radius.
