Solutions Of The Yang-baxter Equations From Braided-Lie Algebras And
  Braided Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain an R-matrix or matrix representation of the Artin braid group
acting in a canonical way on the vector space of every (super)-Lie algebra or
braided-Lie algebra. The same result applies for every (super)-Hopf algebra or
braided-Hopf algebra. We recover some known representations such as those
associated to racks. We also obtain new representations such as a non-trivial
one on the ring $k[x]$ of polynomials in one variable, regarded as a
braided-line. Representations of the extended Artin braid group for braids in
the complement of $S^1$ are also obtained by the same method.
