<title>
Twisted CFT and bilayer Quantum Hall systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We identify the impurity interactions of the recently proposed CFT
description of a bilayer Quantum Hall system at filling nu =m/(pm+2) in Mod.
Phys. Lett. A 15 (2000) 1679. Such a CFT is obtained by m-reduction on the one
layer system, with a resulting pairing symmetry and presence of quasi-holes.
For the m=2 case boundary terms are shown to describe an impurity interaction
which allows for a localized tunnel of the Kondo problem type. The presence of
an anomalous fixed point is evidenced at finite coupling which is unstable with
respect to unbalance and flows to a vacuum state with no quasi-holes.
