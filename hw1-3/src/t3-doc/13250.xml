Non-renormalization theorems from extension to local coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  The extension of coupling constants to space-time dependent fields, the local
couplings, makes possible to derive the non-renormalization theorems of
supersymmetry by an algebraic characterization of Lagrangian N=1
supermultiplets. For super-Yang-Mills theories the construction implies
non-renormalization of the coupling beyond one-loop order. However,
renormalization in presence of the local gauge coupling is peculiar due to a
new anomaly in one-loop order, which appears as an anomaly of supersymmetry in
the Wess-Zumino gauge. As an application we derive the closed all-order
expression for the gauge $\beta$ function and prove the non-renormalization of
general N=2 supersymmetric theories from a cancellation of the susy anomaly.
