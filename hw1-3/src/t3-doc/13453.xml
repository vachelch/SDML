<title>
Role of a "Local" Cosmological Constant in Euclidean Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  In 4D non-perturbative Regge calculus a positive value of the effective
cosmological constant characterizes the collapsed phase of the system. If a
local term of the form $S'=\sum_{h \epsilon \{h_1,h_2,...\} } \lambda_h V_h$ is
added to the gravitational action, where $\{h_1,h_2,...\}$ is a subset of the
hinges and $\{\lambda_h\}$ are positive constants, one expects that the volumes
$V_{h_1}$, $V_{h_2}$, ... tend to collapse and that the excitations of the
lattice propagating through the hinges $\{h_1,h_2,...\}$ are damped. We study
the continuum analogue of this effect. The additional term $S'$ may represent
the coupling of the gravitational field to an external Bose condensate.
