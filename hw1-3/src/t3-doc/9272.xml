Bosonization of Thirring Model in Arbitrary Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose to use a novel master Lagrangian for performing the bosonization
of the $D$-dimensional massive Thirring model in $D=d+1 \ge 2$ dimensions. It
is shown that our master Lagrangian is able to relate the previous
interpolating Lagrangians each other which have been recently used to show the
equivalence of the massive Thirring model in (2+1) dimensions with the
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. Starting from the phase-space path integral
representation of the master Lagrangian, we give an alternative proof for this
equivalence up to the next-to-leading order in the expansion of the inverse
fermion mass. Moreover, in (3+1)-dimensional case, the bosonized theory is
shown to be equivalent to the massive antisymmetric tensor gauge theory. As a
byproduct, we reproduce the well-known result on bosonization of the
(1+1)-dimensional Thirring model following the same strategy. Finally a
possibility of extending our strategy to the non-Abelian case is also
discussed.
