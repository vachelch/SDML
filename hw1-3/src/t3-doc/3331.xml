<title>
Casimir operators of the exceptional group $F_4$: the chain $B_4\subset
  F_4\subset D_{13}$
</title>

<abstract>
  Expressions are given for the Casimir operators of the exceptional group
$F_4$ in a concise form similar to that used for the classical groups. The
chain $B_4\subset F_4\subset D_{13}$ is used to label the generators of $F_4$
in terms of the adjoint and spinor representations of $B_4$ and to express the
26-dimensional representation of $F_4$ in terms of the defining representation
of $D_{13}$. Casimir operators of any degree are obtained and it is shown that
a basis consists of the operators of degree 2, 6, 8 and 12.
