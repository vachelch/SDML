<title>
Poisson Lie Group Symmetries for the Isotropic Rotator
</title>

<abstract>
  We find a new Hamiltonian formulation of the classical isotropic rotator
where left and right $SU(2)$ transformations are not canonical symmetries but
rather Poisson Lie group symmetries. The system corresponds to the classical
analog of a quantum mechanical rotator which possesses quantum group
symmetries. We also examine systems of two classical interacting rotators
having Poisson Lie group symmetries.
