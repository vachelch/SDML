Quantum Chrono-Topology of Nuclear and Sub-Nuclear Reactions
</title>

<abstract>
  A quantum time topological space is developed and applied to solve some
problems about quantum theory. It is disconnected and satifies specific
separation axioms. The degree of disconnectedness of the time-space is a
decreasing function of the number of simultaneous or almost simultaneous
fundamental interactions. In this topology the U+R Penrose dynamics is
implemented by means of a time evolution operator in QFT. This operator is
unitary or non-unitary, depending on the type of quantization of the field
action-integral. The time evolution operator allows to find the Boltzmann
factor in QFT in the above space-time. From an elementary solution of the
Liouville equation the quantization of the time follows and the Planck constant
has been calculated. Compatibility between time-reversal and irreversibility is
spontaneously obtained. The renormalization of the field action-integral
follows from quantization. The solution of the measurement problem and the wave
function reduction have been deduced in the framework of the Schroedinger
theory. The Schroedinger cat's paradoxon and the paradoxon of the wave packet
decay have been resolved.
