Solitons on compact and noncompact spaces in large noncommutativity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study solutions at the minima of scalar field potentials for Moyal spaces
and torii in the large non-commutativity and interprete these solitons in terms
of non-BPS D-branes of string theory. We derive a mass spectrum formula linking
different D-branes together on quantum torii and suggest that it describes
general systems of D-brane bound states extending the D2-D0 one. Then we
propose a shape for the effective potential approaching these quasi-stable
bound states. We give the gauge symmetries of these systems of branes and show
that they depend on the quantum torii representations.
