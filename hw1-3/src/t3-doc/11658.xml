Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  Dynamical supersymmetry breaking is a fascinating theoretical problem. It is
also of phenomenological significance. A better understanding of this
phenomenon can help in model building, which in turn is useful in guiding the
search for supersymmetry. In this article, we review the recent developments in
the field. We discuss a few examples, which allow us to illustrate the main
ideas in the subject. In the process, we also show how the techniques of
holomorphy and duality come into play. Towards the end we indicate how these
developments have helped in the study of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.
The review is intended for someone with a prior knowledge of supersymmetry who
wants to find out about the recent progress in this field.
