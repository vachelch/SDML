<title>
Tree structures, Entropy, and Action Principles for Neighbourhood
  Topologies
</title>

<abstract>
  We recast the idea of decision trees as they emerge in Information theory and
Complexity theory into a set theoretical language; the result we call tree
structures over a given set. We identify all main structural elements of tree
structures, the most important of which is the tree function, defined as a sum
over certain quantities at every nod in the tree. We show in detail that the
minimization of the tree function on, possibly constrained, sets of tree
structures renders the functional form of entropy, or of Wiener-Shannon
information, depending on the context. We suggest three natural axioms defining
tree structures, which are valid also when the underlying set is infinite; in
this case the resulting trees are fractal-like objects. These axioms turn out
to be related to the neighbourhood axioms describing neighbourhoods on a
topological space. In fact we will show that the paths in a tree structure,
which are totally ordered subsets of a tree, can be regarded as a countable
neighbourhood basis, which in turn defines a topology on the underlying set.
The tree function then assigns nonnegative numbers to every neighbourhood
topology on the underlying set that arises from a tree structure. On the
preferred topology, this number becomes minimal, in which case it represents an
entropy-like quantity. This has the distinct flavour of an action principle,
distinguishing certain topologies by means of minimization of the tree
function. This result hints at a deep relation between entropy-like quantities
and preferred neighbourhood topologies on sets.
