Seiberg-Witten Theory of Rank Two Gauge Groups and Hypergeometric Series
</title>

<abstract>
  In SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory, it is known that the dual pair of fields are
expressed by hypergeometric functions. As for the theory with SU(3) gauge
symmetry without matters, it was shown that the dual pairs of fields can be
expressed by means of the Appell function of type F_4. These expressions are
convenient for analyzing analytic properties of fields. We investigate the
relation between Seiberg-Witten theory of rank two gauge group without matters
and hypergeometric series of two variables. It is shown that the relation
between gauge theories and Appell functions can be observed for other classical
gauge groups of rank two. For B_2 and C_2, the fields are written in terms of
Appell functions of type H_5. For D_2, we can express fields by Appell
functions of type F_4 which can be decomposed to two hypergeometric functions,
corresponding to the fact SO(4)\sim SU(2)\times SU(2). We also consider the
integrable curve of type C_2 and show how the fields are expressed by Appell
functions. However in the case of exceptional group G_2, our examination shows
that they can be represented by hypergeometric series which does not correspond
to the Appell functions.
