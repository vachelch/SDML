Almost Conformal Vacua and Confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  Dynamics of confining vacua which appear as deformed superconformal theory
with a non-Abelian gauge symmetry, is studied by taking a concrete example of
the sextet vacua of ${\cal N}=2$, SU(3) gauge theory with $n_f=4$, with equal
quark masses. We show that the low-energy "matter" degrees of freedom of this
theory consist of four magnetic monopole doublets of the low-energy effective
SU(2) gauge group, one dyon doublet, and one electric doublet. We find a
mechanism of cancellation of the beta function, which naturally but
nontrivially generalizes that of Argyres-Douglas. Study of our SCFT theory as a
limit of six colliding ${\cal N}=1$ vacua, suggests that the confinement in the
present theory occurs in an essentially different manner from those vacua with
dynamical Abelianization, and involves strongly interacting non-Abelian
magnetic monopoles.
