<title>
Quantization of the Closed Mini-Superspace Models as Bound States
</title>

<abstract>
  Wheeler-DeWitt equation is applied to $k > 0$ Friedmann Robertson Walker
metric with various types of matter. It is shown that if the Universe ends in
the matter dominated era (e.g., radiation or pressureless gas) with zero
cosmological constant, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation describes a
bound state problem. As solutions of a non-degenerate bound state system, the
eigen-wave functions are real (Hartle-Hawking) and the usual issue associated
with the ambiguity in the boundary conditions for the wave functions is
resolved. Furthermore, as a bound state problem, there exists a quantization
condition that relates the curvature of the three space with the energy density
of the Universe. Incorporating a cosmological constant in the early Universe
(inflation) is given as a natural explanation for the large quantum number
associated with our Universe, which resulted from the quantization condition.
  It is also shown that if there is a cosmological constant $\Lambda > 0$ in
our Universe that persists for all time, then the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt
equation describes a non-bound state system, regardless of the magnitude of the
cosmological constant. As a consequence, the wave functions are in general
complex (Vilenkin) and the initial conditions for wave functions are a free
parameters not determined by the formalism.
