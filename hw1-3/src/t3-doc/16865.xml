Warped brane world supergravity, flipping, and the Scherk-Schwarz
  mechanism
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the relation between the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and flipped
gauged brane-bulk supergravities in five dimensions. We discuss the form of
supersymmetry violating Scherk-Schwarz terms in pure supergravity and in
supergravity coupled to matter. Although the Lagrangian mass terms that arise
as the result of the Scherk-Schwarz redefinition of fields are naturally of the
order of the inverse radius of the orbifold, the effective 4d physical mass
terms are rather set by the scale \sqrt{|\bar{\Lambda}|}, where \bar{\Lambda}
is the 4d cosmlogical constant.
