One-loop corrections to the D3 brane action
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate one-loop corrections to the effective Lagrangian for the D3
brane. We perform the gauge-fixing of the kappa-symmetric Born-Infeld D3 brane
action in the flat background using Killing gauge. The linearized supersymmetry
of the gauge-fixed action coincides with that of the N=4 Yang-Mills theory. We
use the helicity amplitude and unitarity technique to calculate the one-loop
amplitudes at order alpha^4. The counterterms and the finite 1-loop corrections
are of the form (dF)^4 and their supersymmetric generalization. This is to be
contrasted with the Born-Infeld action which contains (F)^4 and other terms
which do not depend on derivatives of the vector field strength.
