Could Only Fermions Be Elementary?
</title>

<abstract>
  In standard Poincare and anti de Sitter SO(2,3) invariant theories, the
existence of antiparticles is explained by using the fact that covariant
equations have solutions with negative energies while a particle and its
antiparticle are described by independent positive energy unitary irreducible
representations (UIRs) of the symmetry group. Such an approach cannot be
applied in de Sitter SO(1,4) invariant theory. As argued in our previous
papers, it would be more natural to require that i) one UIR should describe a
particle and its antiparticle simultaneously. This would automatically explain
the existence of antiparticles and show that a particle and its antiparticle
are different states of the same object. If i) is adopted then, with such a
modification of the standard approach, among the above groups only the SO(1,4)
one is a candidate for constructing elementary particle theory. It is shown
that UIRs of the SO(1,4) group can be interpreted in the framework of i) and
cannot be interpreted in the standard way. By quantizing such UIRs and
requiring that the energy should be positive in the Poincare limit, we conclude
that only fermions can be elementary particles.
