World-volume Solitons of the D3-brane in the Background of (p,q)
  Five-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the world-volume solitons of a D3-brane probe in the background of
parallel (p,q) five-branes. The D3-brane is embedded along the directions
transverse to the five-branes of the background. By using the S-duality
invariance of the D3-brane, we find a first-order differential equation whose
solutions saturate an energy bound. The SO(3) invariant solutions of this
equation are found analytically. They represent world-volume solitons which can
be interpreted as formed by parallel (-q,p) strings emanating from the D3-brane
world-volume. It is shown that these configurations are 1/4 supersymmetric and
provide a world-volume realization of the Hanany-Witten effect.
