Improved Effective Potential in Curved Spacetime and Quantum Matter -
  Higher Derivative Gravity Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  \noindent{\large\bf Abstract.} We develop a general formalism to study the
renormalization group (RG) improved effective potential for renormalizable
gauge theories ---including matter-$R^2$-gravity--- in curved spacetime. The
result is given up to quadratic terms in curvature, and one-loop effective
potentials may be easiliy obtained from it. As an example, we consider scalar
QED, where dimensional transmutation in curved space and the phase structure of
the potential (in particular, curvature-induced phase trnasitions), are
discussed. For scalar QED with higher-derivative quantum gravity (QG), we
examine the influence of QG on dimensional transmutation and calculate QG
corrections to the scalar-to-vector mass ratio. The phase structure of the
RG-improved effective potential is also studied in this case, and the values of
the induced Newton and cosmological coupling constants at the critical point
are estimated. Stability of the running scalar coupling in the Yukawa theory
with conformally invariant higher-derivative QG, and in the Standard Model with
the same addition, is numerically analyzed. We show that, in these models, QG
tends to make the scalar sector less unstable.
