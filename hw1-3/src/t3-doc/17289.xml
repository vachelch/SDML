<title>
Generalized Two-Dimensional QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We study two-dimensional gauge theories with fundamental fermions and a
general first order gauge-field Lagrangian. For the case of U(1) we show how
standard bosonization of the Schwinger model generalizes to give mesons
interacting through a general Landau-Ginzburg potential. We then show how for a
subclass of SU(N) theories, 't Hooft's solution of large N two-dimensional QCD
can be generalized in a consistent and natural manner. We finally point out the
possible relevance of studying these theories to the string formulation of
two-dimensional QCD as well as to understanding QCD in higher dimensions.
