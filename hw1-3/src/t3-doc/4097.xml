Noncompact Symmetries in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Noncompact groups, similar to those that appeared in various supergravity
theories in the 1970's, have been turning up in recent studies of string
theory. First it was discovered that moduli spaces of toroidal compactification
are given by noncompact groups modded out by their maximal compact subgroups
and discrete duality groups. Then it was found that many other moduli spaces
have analogous descriptions. More recently, noncompact group symmetries have
turned up in effective actions used to study string cosmology and other
classical configurations. This paper explores these noncompact groups in the
case of toroidal compactification both from the viewpoint of low-energy
effective field theory, using the method of dimensional reduction, and from the
viewpoint of the string theory world sheet. The conclusion is that all these
symmetries are intimately related. In particular, we find that Chern--Simons
terms in the three-form field strength $H_{\mu\nu\rho}$ play a crucial role.
