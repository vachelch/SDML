String Unification and Threshold Corrections
</title>

<abstract>
  The interpretation of the apparent unification of gauge couplings within
supersymmetric theories depends on uncertainties induced through heavy particle
thresholds. While in standard grand unified theories these effects can be
estimated easily, the corresponding calculations are quite complicated in
string unified theories and do exist only in models with unbroken $E_6$. We
present results for heavy particle thresholds in more realistic models with
gauge group $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. Effects of Wilson line background
fields as well as the universal part of the (rather mild) threshold corrections
indicate a strong model dependence. We discuss the consequences of our results
for the idea of string unification without a grand unified gauge group.
