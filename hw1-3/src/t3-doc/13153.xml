Residual Gauge Fixing in Light-Front QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Understanding the nontrivial features of light-front QCD is a central goal in
current investigations of nonperturbative light-front field theory. We find
that, with the choice of light-front gauge with antisymmetric boundary
conditions for the field variables, the residual gauge freedom is fixed and the
light-front QCD vacuum is trivial. The nontrivial structure in light-front QCD
is determined by non-vanishing asymptotic physical (transverse) gauge fields at
longitudinal infinity, which are responsible for nonzero topological winding
number.
