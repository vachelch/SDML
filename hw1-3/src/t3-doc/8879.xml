<title>
A thick shell Casimir effect
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Casimir energy of a thick dielectric-diamagnetic shell under
a uniform velocity light condition, as a function of the radii and the
permeabilities. We show that there is a range of parameters in which the stress
on the outer shell is inward, and a range where the stress on the outer shell
is outward. We examine the possibility of obtaining an energetically stable
configuration of a thick shell made of a material with a fixed volume.
