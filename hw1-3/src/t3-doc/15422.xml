<title>
A solution to the zero-hamiltonian problem in 2-D gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The zero-hamiltonian problem, present in reparametrization invariant systems,
is solved for the 2-D induced gravity model. Working with methods developed by
Henneaux et al. we find systematically the reduced phase-space physics,
generated by an {\it effective} hamiltonian obtained after complete gauge
fixing.
