Gauged Supergravities from Spherical Reductions
</title>

<abstract>
  This dissertation is devoted to deriving the bosonic sectors of certain
gauged supergravities in various dimensions from reducing eleven-dimensional
supergravity, type IIA and type IIB supergravities in ten dimensions on certain
spherical spaces. Explicit non-linear Kaluza-Klein ans\"atze for reductions of
eleven-dimensional supergravity and of type IIA and type IIB supergravities on
$S^n$ and $S^n\times T^m$ are presented. Knowing explicit non-linear ans\"atze
is proven to be very useful in finding super Yang-Mills operators of gauge
theories via AdS/CFT correspondence. We present a sample calculation which
allows us to find a super Yang-Mills operator using a non-linear ansatz.
Knowing non-linear ans\"atze is also useful for finding supergravity duals to
certain twisted supersymmetric gauge theories. These supergravity solutions are
branes wrapped on certain supersymmetric cycles. Some solutions, which are dual
to gauge theories in three and five dimensions, are presented.
