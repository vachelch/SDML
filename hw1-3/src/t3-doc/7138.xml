<title>
On SUSY-QM, fractal strings and steps towards a proof of the Riemann
  hypothesis
</title>

<abstract>
  We present, using spectral analysis, a possible way to prove the Riemann's
hypothesis (RH) that the only zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function are of the
form s=1/2+i\lambda_n. A supersymmetric quantum mechanical model is proposed as
an alternative way to prove the Riemann's conjecture, inspired in the
Hilbert-Polya proposal; it uses an inverse eigenvalue approach associated with
a system of p-adic harmonic oscillators. An interpretation of the Riemann's
fundamental relation Z(s) = Z(1-s) as a duality relation, from one fractal
string L to another dual fractal string L' is proposed.
