<title>
On the Divergence of Perturbation Theory. Steps Towards a Convergent
  Series
</title>

<abstract>
  The mechanism underlying the divergence of perturbation theory is exposed.
This is done through a detailed study of the violation of the hypothesis of the
Dominated Convergence Theorem of Lebesgue using familiar techniques of Quantum
Field Theory. That theorem governs the validity (or lack of it) of the formal
manipulations done to generate the perturbative series in the functional
integral formalism. The aspects of the perturbative series that need to be
modified to obtain a convergent series are presented. Useful tools for a
practical implementation of these modifications are developed. Some resummation
methods are analyzed in the light of the above mentioned mechanism.
