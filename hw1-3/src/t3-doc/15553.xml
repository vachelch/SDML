Vacuum energy on orbifold factors of spheres
</title>

<abstract>
  The vacuum energy is calculated for a free, conformally-coupled scalar field
on the orbifold space-time \R$\times \S^2/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a
finite subgroup of O(3) acting with fixed points. The energy vanishes when
$\Gamma$ is composed of pure rotations but not otherwise. It is shown on
general grounds that the same conclusion holds for all even-dimensional
factored spheres and the vacuum energies are given as generalised Bernoulli
functions (i.e. Todd polynomials). The relevant $\zeta$- functions are analysed
in some detail and several identities are incidentally derived. The general
discussion is presented in terms of finite reflection groups.
