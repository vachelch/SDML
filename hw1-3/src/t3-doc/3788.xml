The Enhancon, Black Holes, and the Second Law
</title>

<abstract>
  We revisit the physics of five-dimensional black holes constructed from D5-
and D1-branes and momentum modes in type IIB string theory compactified on K3.
Since these black holes incorporate D5-branes wrapped on K3, an enhancon locus
appears in the spacetime geometry. With a `small' number of D1-branes, the
entropy of a black hole is maximised by including precisely half as many
D5-branes as there are D1-branes in the black hole. Any attempts to introduce
more D5-branes, and so reduce the entropy, are thwarted by the appearance of
the enhancon locus above the horizon, which then prevents their approach. The
enhancon mechanism thereby acts to uphold the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
This result generalises: For each type of bound state object which can be made
of both types of brane, we show that a new type of enhancon exists at
successively smaller radii in the geometry, again acting to prevent any
reduction of the entropy just when needed. We briefly explore the appearance of
the enhancon in the black hole interior.
