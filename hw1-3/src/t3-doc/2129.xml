<title>
Exact spectrum and partition function of SU(m|n) supersymmetric
  Polychronakos model
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the fact that Polychronakos-like models can be obtained through the
`freezing limit' of related spin Calogero models, we calculate the exact
spectrum as well as partition function of SU(m|n) supersymmetric Polychronakos
(SP) model. It turns out that, similar to the non-supersymmetric case, the
spectrum of SU(m|n) SP model is also equally spaced. However, the degeneracy
factors of corresponding energy levels crucially depend on the values of
bosonic degrees of freedom (m) and fermionic degrees of freedom (n). As a
result, the partition functions of SP models are expressed through some novel
q-polynomials. Finally, by interchanging the bosonic and fermionic degrees of
freedom, we obtain a duality relation among the partition functions of SP
models.
