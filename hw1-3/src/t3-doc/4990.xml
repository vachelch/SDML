<title>
Spectrum of boundary states in N=1 SUSY sine-Gordon theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider N=1 supersymmetric sine-Gordon theory (SSG) with supersymmetric
integrable boundary conditions (boundary SSG = BSSG). We find two possible ways
to close the boundary bootstrap for this model, corresponding to two different
choices for the boundary supercharge. We argue that these two bootstrap
solutions should correspond to the two integrable Lagrangian boundary theories
considered recently by Nepomechie.
