On the inflationary solutions in higher-derivative gravity with dilaton
  field
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the existence of de Sitter inflationary solutions for the
string-inspired fourth-derivative gravity theories with dilaton field. We
consider a space-time of arbitrary dimension D and an arbitrary
parametrization of the target space metric. The specific features of the theory
in dimension D=4 and those of the special ghost-free parametrization of the
metric are found. We also consider similar string-inspired theories with
torsion and construct an inflationary solution with torsion and dilaton for
D=4. The stability of the inflationary solutions is also investigated.
