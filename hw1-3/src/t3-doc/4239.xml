Integrability of Schwinger-Dyson Equations in 2D Quantum Gravity 
  and c < 1 Non-critical String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the integrability of the Schwinger-Dyson equations in $c = 1 -
\frac{6}{m(m+1)}$ string field theory which were proposed by Ikehara et al as
the continuum limit of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the matrix chain model.
We show the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations generate a closed algebra. This
algebra contains Virasoro algebra but does not coincide with $W_{\infty}$
algebra. We include in the Schwinger-Dyson equations a new process of removing
from the loop boundaries the operator ${\cal H}(\sigma)$ which locally changes
the spin configuration. We also derive the string field Hamiltonian from the
continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. Its form is universal for all $c = 1 -
\frac{6}{m(m+1)}$ string theories.
