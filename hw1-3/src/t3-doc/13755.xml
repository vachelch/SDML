Gauge Fixing and Scattering Amplitudes in String Field Theory around
  Universal Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a gauge fixed action of open string field theory around the
universal solution which has been found as an analytic classical solution with
one parameter a. For a>-1/2, we can reproduce open string scattering amplitudes
in the theory fixed in the Siegel gauge. At a=-1/2, all scattering amplitudes
vanish and there is no open string excitation in the gauge fixed theory. These
results support the conjecture that the universal solution can be regarded as
pure gauge or the tachyon vacuum solution.
