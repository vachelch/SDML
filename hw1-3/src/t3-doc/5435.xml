<title>
Multi-Instanton Calculus and the AdS/CFT Correspondence in N=4
  Superconformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a self-contained study of ADHM multi-instantons in SU(N) gauge
theory, especially the novel interplay with supersymmetry and the large-N
limit. We give both field- and string-theoretic derivations of the N=4
supersymmetric multi-instanton action and collective coordinate integration
measure. As a central application, we focus on certain n-point functions G_n,
n=16, 8 or 4, in N=4 SU(N) gauge theory at the conformal point (as well as on
related higher-partial-wave correlators); these are correlators in which the 16
exact supersymmetric and superconformal fermion zero modes are saturated. In
the large-N limit, for the first time in any 4-dimensional theory, we are able
to evaluate all leading-order multi-instanton contributions exactly. We find
compelling evidence for Maldacena's conjecture: (1) The large-N k-instanton
collective coordinate space has the geometry of a single copy of AdS_5 x S^5.
(2) The integration measure on this space includes the partition function of
10-dimensional N=1 SU(k) gauge theory dimensionally reduced to 0 dimensions,
matching the description of D-instantons in Type IIB string theory. (3) In
exact agreement with Type IIB string calculations, at the k-instanton level,
G_n = \sqrt{N} g^8 k^{n-7/2} e^{2\pi ik\tau} \sum_{d|k} d^{-2}
F_n(x_1,...,x_n), where F_n is identical to a convolution of n bulk-to-boundary
supergravity propagators.
