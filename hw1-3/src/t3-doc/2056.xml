<title>
Conformal Sigma Models for a Class of $T^{p,q}$ Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a 2-d conformal theory based on (G x G')/ H coset sigma model
introduced by Guadagnini, Martellini and Mintchev. It is shown that in the case
of {SU(2) x SU(2)}/ U(1) the metric of the corresponding background is of
T^{p,q} coset space form (but is not an Einstein one). Similar interpretation
is possible for the Lorentzian coset space W_{4,2}= {SL(2,R) x SL(2,R)}/U(1).
The resulting 10-d homogeneous space metric on W_{4,2} x T^{p,q} supplemented
with 2-form field gives a critical NS-NS superstring background with conformal
sigma model interpretation.
