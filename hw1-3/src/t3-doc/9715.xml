<title>
The Topological Unitarity Identities in Chern-Simons Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the generating functional of the theory of relativistic spinors
in 2+1 dimensions interacting through the pure Chern-Simons gauge field, the
S-matrix is constructed and seen to be formally the same as that of spinor
quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with Feynman diagrams having external
photon lines excluded, and with the propagator of the topological Chern-Simons
photon substituted for the Maxwell photon propagator. It is shown that the
absence of real topological photons in the complete set of vector states of the
total Hilbert space leads in a given order of perturbation theory to
topological unitarity identities that demand the vanishing of the
gauge-invariant sum of the imaginary parts of Feynman diagrams with a given
number of internal on-shell free topological photon lines. It is also shown,
that these identities can be derived outside the framework of perturbation
theory. The identities are verified explicitly for the scattering of a
fermion-antifermion pair in one-loop order.
