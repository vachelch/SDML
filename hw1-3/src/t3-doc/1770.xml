<title>
Neutral Multi-Instanton as a Bridge from Weak to Strong Coupling phase
  in Two Dimensional QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a contour integral representation we analyze the multi-instanton sector
in two dimensional $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on a sphere and argue the role of
multi-instanton in the large $N$ phase transition. In the strong coupling
region at the large $N$ , we encounter ``singular saddle point''. Because of
this situation, ``neutral'' configurations of the multi-instanton are dominant
in this region. Based on the ``neutral'' multi-instanton approximation we
numerically calculate the multi-instanton amplitude , the free energies and the
Wilson loops for finite $N$ . We also compare our results with the large $N$
exact solution of the free energy and the Wilson loop and argue some problems.
We find the ``neutral'' multi-instanton contribution bridges the gap between
weak and strong coupling phase.
