Non-Trivial Directions for Scalar Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the eigenvectors of the renormalization-group matrix for scalar
fields at the Gaussian fixed point, and find that that there exist ``relevant''
directions in parameter space. They correspond to theories with exponential
potentials that are nontrivial and asymptotically free. All other potentials,
including polynomial potentials, are ``irrelevant,'' and lead to trivial
theories. Away from the Gaussian fixed point, renormalization does not induce
derivative couplings, but it generates non-local interactions.
