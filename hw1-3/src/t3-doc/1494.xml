Newton's law in braneworlds with an infinite extra dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the behavior of the four$-$dimensional Newton's law in warped
braneworlds. The setup considered here is a $(3+n)$-brane embedded in $(5+n)$
dimensions, where $n$ extra dimensions are compactified and a dimension is
infinite. We show that the wave function of gravity is described in terms of
the Bessel functions of $(2+n/2)$-order and that estimate the correction to
Newton's law. In particular, the Newton's law for $n=1$ can be exactly
obtained.
