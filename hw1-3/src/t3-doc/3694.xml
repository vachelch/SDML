Bv Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the Non-Abelian Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism introduced recently, we
present a generalization of the Yang-Mills gauge transformations , to include
antisymmetric tensor fields as gauge bosons. The Freedman-Townsend
transformation for the two-form gauge field is automatically recovered. New
characteristic classes involving this two-form field and the Yang-Mills
one-form field are derived. We also show how to include, in an unified way, a
gauge invariant coupling of the new gauge bosons to fermionic and bosonic
matter.
