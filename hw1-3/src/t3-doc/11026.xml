<title>
The cubic matrix model and a duality between strings and loops
</title>

<abstract>
  We find evidence for a duality between the standard matrix formulations of M
theory and a background independent theory which extends loop quantum gravity
by replacing SU(2) with a supersymmetric and quantum group extension of SU(16).
This is deduced from the recently proposed cubic matrix model for M theory
which has been argued to have compactifications which reduce to the IKKT and
dWHN-BFSS matrix models. Here we find new compactifications of this theory
whose Hilbert spaces consist of SU(16) conformal blocks on compact
two-surfaces. These compactifications break the SU(N) symmetry of the standard
M theory compactifications, while preserving SU(16), while the BFSS model
preserve the SU(N) but break SU(16) to the SO(9) symmetry of the 11 dimensional
light cone coordinates. These results suggest that the supersymmetric and
quantum deformed SU(16) extension of loop quantum gravity provides a dual,
background independent description of the degrees of freedom and dynamics of
the M theory matrix models.
