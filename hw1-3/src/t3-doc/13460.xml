Gravitomagnetism in Brane-Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we discuss a physical observable which is drastically different
in a brane-world scenario. To date, the Randall-Sundrum model seems to be
consistent with all experimental tests of general relativity. Specifically, we
examine the so-called gravitomagnetic effect in the context of the
Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. This treatment, of course, assumes the recovery of
the Kerr metric in brane-worlds which we have found to the first order in the
ratio of the brane separation to the radius of the AdS$_5$, $(\ell/r)$. We
first show that the second Randall-Sundrum model of one brane leaves the
gravitomagnetic effect unchanged. Then, we consider the two-brane scenario of
the original Randall-Sundrum proposal and show that the magnitude of the
gravitomagnetic effect depends heavily on the ratio of $(\ell/r)$. Such
dependence is a result of the geometrodynamic spacetime and does not appear in
static scenarios. We hope that we will be able to test this proposal
experimentally with data from NASA's Gravity Probe B (GP-B)and possibly
disprove either the Randall-Sundrum two-brane scenario or standard general
relativity.
