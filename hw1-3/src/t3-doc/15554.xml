<title>
Eleven Dimensional Origin of String/String Duality: A One Loop Test
</title>

<abstract>
  Membrane/fivebrane duality in D=11 implies Type IIA string/Type IIA fivebrane
duality in D=10, which in turn implies Type IIA string/heterotic string duality
in D=6. To test the conjecture, we reproduce the corrections to the 3-form
field equations of the D=10 Type IIA string (a mixture of tree-level and
one-loop effects) starting from the Chern-Simons corrections to the 7-form
Bianchi identities of the D=11 fivebrane (a purely tree-level effect). K3
compactification of the latter then yields the familiar gauge and Lorentz
Chern-Simons corrections to 3-form Bianchi identities of the heterotic string.
We note that the absence of a dilaton in the D=11 theory allows us to fix both
the gravitational constant and the fivebrane tension in terms of the membrane
tension. We also comment on an apparent conflict between fundamental and
solitonic heterotic strings and on the puzzle of a fivebrane origin of
S-duality.
