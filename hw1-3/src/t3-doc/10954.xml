<title>
Inflation and flat directions in modular invariant superstring effective
  theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The potential during inflation must be very flat in, at least, the direction
of the inflaton. In renormalizable global supersymmetry, flat directions are
ubiquitous, but they are not preserved in a generic supergravity theory. It is
known that at least some of them are preserved in no-scale supergravity, and
simple generalizations of it. We here study a more realistic generalization,
based on string-derived supergravity, using the linear supermultiplet formalism
for the dilaton. We consider a general class of hybrid inflation models, where
a Fayet-Illiopoulos $D$ term drives some fields to large values. The potential
is dominated by the $F$ term, but flatness is preserved in some directions.
This allows inflation, with the dilaton stabilized in its domain of attraction,
and some moduli stabilized at their vacuum values. Another modulus may be the
inflaton.
