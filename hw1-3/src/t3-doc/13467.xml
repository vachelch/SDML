Large Mass Invariant Asymptotics of the Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the large mass asymptotics of the Dirac operator with a
nondegenerate mass matrix m={diag}(m_1,m_2,m_3) in the presence of scalar and
pseudoscalar background fields taking values in the Lie algebra of the U(3)
group. The corresponding one-loop effective action is regularized by the
Schwinger's proper-time technique. Using a well-known operator identity, we
obtain a series representation for the heat kernel which differs from the
standard proper-time expansion, if m_1\ne m_2\ne m_3. After integrating over
the proper-time we use a new algorithm to resum the series. The invariant
coefficients which define the asymptotics of the effective action are
calculated up to the fourth order and compared with the related Seeley-DeWitt
coefficients for the particular case of a degenerate mass matrix with
m_1=m_2=m_3.
