Can MAP and Planck map Planck physics?
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate whether a recently proposed modulation of the power spectrum
of primordial density fluctuations generated through transplankian (maybe
stringy) effects during inflation can be observed. We briefly review the
mechanism leading to the modulation and apply it to a generic slow-roll
scenario of inflation. We then investigate how these primordial modulation
effects leave an imprint in the cosmic microwave background radiation. Our
conclusions are that for favourable parameter values already the presently
flying MAP satellite will have a chance to detect such transplanckian
oscillations in the pattern of temperature fluctuations on the sky, and that
the upcoming Planck satellite will either detect them or put stringent limits
related to the mass scale where the new effects appear.
