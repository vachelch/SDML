<title>
Dirac-K\"ahler approach connected to quantum mechanics in Grassmann
  space
</title>

<abstract>
  We compare the way one of us got spinors out of fields, which are a priori
antisymmetric tensor fields, to the Dirac-K\"ahler rewriting. Since using our
Grassmann formulation is simple it may be useful in describing the
Dirac-K\"ahler formulation of spinors and in generalizing it to vector internal
degrees of freedom and to charges. The ``cheat'' concerning the Lorentz
transformations for spinors is the same in both cases and is put clearly
forward in the Grassmann formulation. Also the generalizations are clearly
pointed out. The discrete symmetries are discussed, in particular the
appearance of two kinds of the time-reversal operators as well as the
unavoidability of four families.
