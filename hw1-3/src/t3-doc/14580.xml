A Quantum Field Theory with Infinite Resonance States
</title>

<abstract>
  We study an integrable quantum field theory of a single stable particle with
an infinite number of resonance states. The exact $S$--matrix of the model is
expressed in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions which encode the resonance
poles inherently. In the limit $l \to 0$, with $l$ the modulus of the Jacobian
elliptic function, it reduces to the Sinh--Gordon $S$--matrix. We address the
problem of computing the Form Factors of the model by studying their monodromy
and recursive equations. These equations turn out to possess infinitely many
solutions for any given number of external particles. This infinite spectrum of
solutions may be related to the irrational nature of the underlying Conformal
Field Theory reached in the ultraviolet limit. We also discuss an elliptic
version of the thermal massive Ising model which is obtained by a particular
value of the coupling constant.
