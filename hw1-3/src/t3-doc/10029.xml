<title>
Hidden Symmetry of a Fluid Dynamical Model
</title>

<abstract>
  A connection between solutions of the relativistic d-brane system in (d+1)
dimensions with the solutions of a Galileo invariant fluid in d-dimensions is
by now well established. However, the physical nature of the light-cone gauge
description of a relativistic membrane changes after the reduction to the fluid
dynamical model since the gauge symmetry is lost. In this work we argue that
the original gauge symmetry present in a relativistic d-brane system can be
recovered after the reduction process to a d-dimensional fluid model. To this
end we propose, without introducing Wess-Zumino fields, a gauge invariant
theory of isentropic fluid dynamics and show that this symmetry corresponds to
the invariance under local translation of the velocity potential in the fluid
dynamics picture. We show that different but equivalent choices of the
sympletic sector lead to distinct representations of the embedded gauge
algebra.
