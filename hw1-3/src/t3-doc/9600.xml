On the Generalized Exclusion Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the principal steps leading to drive the wave function $\psi
_{\{k_1,k_2,...,k_N \}}(1,2,...,N)$ of a gaz of $N$ identical particle states
with exotic statistics. For spins $s=1/M$ $mod(1)$, we show that the
quasideterminant conjectured in [19], by using $2d$ conformal field theoretical
methods, is indeed related to the quantum determinant of noncommutative
geometry. The q-number $[N]!=\prod_{n=1}^N(\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} q^j)$ carrying the
effect of the generalized Pauli exclusion principle, according to which no more
than $(M-1)$ identical particles of spin $s=1/M$ $mod(1)$ can live altogether
on the same quantum state, is rederived in rigourous from the q-antisymmetry.
Other features are also given.
