Multi-soliton dynamics in the Skyrme model
</title>

<abstract>
  We exhibit the dynamical scattering of multi-solitons in the Skyrme model for
configurations with charge two, three and four. First, we construct maximally
attractive configurations from a simple profile function and the product
ansatz. Then using a sophisticated numerical algorithm, initially
well-separated skyrmions in approximately symmetric configurations are shown to
scatter through the known minimum energy configurations. These scattering
events illustrate a number of similarities to BPS monopole configurations of
the same charge. A simple modification of the dynamics to a dissipative regime,
allows us to compute the minimal energy skyrmions for baryon numbers one to
four to within a few percent.
