Chiral Extensions of the WZNW Phase Space, Poisson-Lie Symmetries and
  Groupoids
</title>

<abstract>
  The chiral WZNW symplectic form $\Omega^{\rho}_{chir}$ is inverted in the
general case. Thereby a precise relationship between the arbitrary monodromy
dependent 2-form appearing in $\Omega^{\rho}_{chir}$ and the exchange r-matrix
that governs the Poisson brackets of the group valued chiral fields is
established. The exchange r-matrices are shown to satisfy a new dynamical
generalization of the classical modified Yang-Baxter (YB) equation and
Poisson-Lie (PL) groupoids are constructed that encode this equation
analogously as PL groups encode the classical YB equation. For an arbitrary
simple Lie group G, exchange r-matrices are found that are in one-to-one
correspondence with the possible PL structures on G and admit them as PL
symmetries.
