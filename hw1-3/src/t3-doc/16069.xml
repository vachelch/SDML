Counting States of Black Strings with Traveling Waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a family of solutions to string theory which depend on arbitrary
functions and contain regular event horizons. They describe six dimensional
extremal black strings with traveling waves and have an inhomogeneous
distribution of momentum along the string. The structure of these solutions
near the horizon is studied and the horizon area computed. We also count the
number of BPS string states at weak coupling whose macroscopic momentum
distribution agrees with that of the black string. It is shown that the number
of such states is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black string
with traveling waves.
