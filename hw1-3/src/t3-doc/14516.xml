The AdS/CFT Correspondence and Logarithmic Corrections to Braneworld
  Cosmology and the Cardy-Verlinde Formula
</title>

<abstract>
  The AdS/CFT correspondence is employed to derive logarithmic corrections to
the Cardy-Verlinde formula when thermal fluctuations in the Anti-de Sitter
black hole are accounted for. The qualitative effect of these corrections on
the braneworld cosmology is investigated. The role of such terms in enabling a
contracting universe to undergo a bounce is demonstrated. Their influence on
the stability of black holes in AdS space and the Hawking-Page-Witten phase
transitions is also discussed.
