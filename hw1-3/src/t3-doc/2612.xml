Systematic Differential Renormalization to All Orders
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a systematic implementation of differential renormalization to all
orders in perturbation theory. The method is applied to individual Feynamn
graphs written in coordinate space. After isolating every singularity. which
appears in a bare diagram, we define a subtraction procedure which consists in
replacing the core of the singularity by its renormalized form givenby a
differential formula. The organizationof subtractions in subgraphs relies in
Bogoliubov's formula, fulfilling the requirements of locality, unitarity and
Lorentz invariance. Our method bypasses the use of an intermediate
regularization andautomatically delivers renormalized amplitudes which obey
renormalization group equations.
