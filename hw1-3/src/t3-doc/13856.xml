Prepotentials, Bi-linear Forms on Periods and Enhanced Gauge Symmetries
  in Type-II Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a bi-linear form on the periods of Calabi-Yau spaces. These are
used to obtain the prepotentials around conifold singularities in type-II
strings compactified on Calabi-Yau space. The explicit construction of the
bi-linear forms is achieved for the one-moduli models as well as two moduli
models with K3-fibrations where the enhanced gauge symmetry is known to be
observed at conifold locus. We also show how these bi-linear forms are related
with the existence of flat coordinates. We list the resulting prepotentials in
two moduli models around the conifold locus, which contains alpha' corrections
of 4-D N=2 SUSY SU(2) Yang-Mills theory as the stringy effect.
