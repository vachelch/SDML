Counting Closed String States in a Box
</title>

<abstract>
  The computation of the microcanonical density of states for a string gas in a
finite volume needs a one by one count because of the discrete nature of the
spectrum. We present a way to do it using geometrical arguments in phase space.
We take advantage of this result in order to obtain the thermodynamical
magnitudes of the system. We show that the results for an open universe exactly
coincide with the infinite volume limit of the expression obtained for the gas
in a box. For any finite volume the Hagedorn temperature is a maximum one, and
the specific heat is always positive. We also present a definition of pressure
compatible with R-duality seen as an exact symmetry, which allows us to make a
study on the physical phase space of the system. Besides a maximum temperature
the gas presents an asymptotic pressure.
