Gauge Conditions for the Constrained-WZNW--Toda Reductions
</title>

<abstract>
  There is a constrained-WZNW--Toda theory for any simple Lie algebra equipped
with an integral gradation. It is explained how the different approaches to
these dynamical systems are related by gauge transformations. Combining Gauss
decompositions in relevent gauges, we unify formulae already derived, and
explictly determine the holomorphic expansion of the conformally reduced WZNW
solutions - whose restriction gives the solutions of the Toda equations. The
same takes place also for semi-integral gradations. Most of our conclusions are
also applicable to the affine Toda theories.
