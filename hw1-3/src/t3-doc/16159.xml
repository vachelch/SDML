String fine tuning
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop further a new geometrical model of a discretized string, proposed
in [1] and establish its basic physical properties. The model can be considered
as the natural extention of the usual Feynman amplitude of the random walks to
random surfaces. Both amplitudes coinside in the case, when the surface
degenarates into a single particle world line. We extend the model to open
surfaces as well. The boundary contribution is proportional to the full length
of the boundary and the coefficient of proportionality can be treated as a
hopping parameter of the quarks. In the limit, when this parameter tends to
infinity, the theory is essentialy simlplified. We prove that the contribution
of a given triangulation to the partition function is finite and have found the
explicit form for the upper bound. The question of the convergence of the full
partition function remains open. In this model the string tension may vanish at
the critical point, if the last one exists, and possess a nontrivial scaling
limit. The model contains hidden fermionic variables and can be considered as
an independent model of hadrons.
