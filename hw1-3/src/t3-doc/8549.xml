<title>
Vortex condensation in a model of random $\phi^{4}$-graphs
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a soluble model of large $\phi^{4}$-graphs randomly embedded in
one compactified dimension; namely the large-order behaviour of
finite-temperature perturbation theory for the partition function of the
anharmonic oscillator. We solve the model using semi-classical methods and
demonstrate the existence of a critical temperature at which the system
undergoes a second-order phase transition from $D=1$ to $D=0$ behaviour.
Non-trivial windings of the closed loops in a graph around the compactified
time direction are interpreted as vortices. The critical point has a natural
interpretation as the temperature at which these vortices condense and disorder
the system. We show that the vortex density increases rapidly in the critical
region indicating the breakdown of the dilute vortex gas approximation at this
point. We discuss the relation of this phenomenon to the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the $D=1$ matrix model formulated
on a circle.
