<title>
A correspondence between standard model fermions and degrees of freedom
  of polycrystalline materials
</title>

<abstract>
  We identify natural degrees of freedom of polycrystalline materials -- affine
transformations of grains -- with those of a three-dimensional lattice theory
for $(T\otimes\Omega)(\mathbb{R}^3)$. We define a lattice Dirac operator on
this space and identify its continuous limit with the free field limit of the
whole fermionic sector of the standard model. Fermion doubling is used here as
a tool to obtain the necessary number of steps of freedom. The correspondence
extends to important structural properties (families, colors, flavor pairs,
electromagnetic charge). We find a lattice version of chiral symmetry similar
to the Ginsparg-Wilson approach.
  This correspondence suggests to propose a ``polycrystalline ether''. Combined
with GLET, a general Lorentz ether theory of gravity with GR limit, this
becomes a concept for a theory of everything. The extension to gauge fields is
the major open problem and requires new concepts.
