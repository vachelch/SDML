<title>
Universality Class of Confining Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  A recently proposed model of confining strings has a non-local world-sheet
action induced by a space-time Kalb-Ramond tensor field. Here we show that, in
the large-D approximation, an infinite set of ghost- and tachyon-free
truncations of the derivative expansion of this action all lead to c=1 models.
Their infrared limit describes smooth strings with world-sheets of Hausdorff
dimension D_H=2 and long-range orientational order, as expected for QCD
strings.
