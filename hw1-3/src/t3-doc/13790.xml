D=4 N=1 Type IIB Orientifolds with Continuous Wilson Lines, Moving
  Branes, and their Field Theory Realization
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate four-dimensional N=1 Type IIB orientifolds with continuous
Wilson lines, and their T-dual realizations as orientifolds with moving branes.
When continuous Wilson lines become discrete the gauge symmetry is enhanced and
the T-dual orientifold corresponds to branes sitting at the orbifold fixed
points. There is a field theoretic analog describing these phenomena as D- and
F-flat deformations of the T-dual model, where the branes sit at the origin
(original model without Wilson lines) as well as a deformation of the T-dual
model where sets of branes sit at the fixed points (the model with discrete
Wilson lines). We demonstrate these phenomena for the prototype Z_3
orientifold: we present an explicit construction of the general set of
continuous Wilson lines as well as their explicit field theoretic realization.
