<title>
Localizing gravity on a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole in seven dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We present regular solutions for a brane world scenario in the form of a 't
Hooft-Polyakov monopole living in the three-dimensional spherical symmetric
transverse space of a seven-dimensional spacetime. In contrast to the cases of
a domain-wall in five dimensions and a string in six dimensions, there exist
gravity-localizing solutions for both signs of the bulk cosmological constant.
A detailed discussion of the parameter space that leads to localization of
gravity is given. A point-like monopole limit is discussed.
