String Without Strings

<abstract>
  Scale invariance provides a principled reason for the physical importance of
Hilbert space, the Virasoro algebra, the string mode expansion, canonical
commutators and Schroedinger evolution of states, independent of the
assumptions of string theory and quantum theory. The usual properties of
dimensionful fields imply an infinite, projective tower of conformal weights
associated with the tangent space to scale-invariant spacetimes. Convergence
and measurability on this tangent tower are guaranteed using a scale-invariant
norm, restricted to conformally self-dual vectors. Maps on the resulting
Hilbert space are correspondingly restricted to semi-definite conformal weight.
We find the maximally- and minimally-commuting, complete Lie algebras of
definite-weight operators. The projective symmetry of the tower gives these
algebras central charges, giving the canonical commutator and quantum Virasoro
algebras, respectively. Using a continuous, m-parameter representation for
rank-m tower tensors, we show that the parallel transport equation for the
momentum vector of a particle is the Schroedinger equation, while the
associated definite-weight operators obey canonical commutation relations.
Generalizing to the set of integral curves of general timelike, self-dual
vector-valued weight maps gives a lifting such that the action of the curves
parallel transports arbitrary tower vectors. We prove that the full set of
Schroedinger-lifted integral curves of a general self-dual map gives an
immersion of its 2-dim parameter space into spacetime, inducing a Lorentzian
metric on the parameter space. The immersion is shown to satisfy the
variational equations of open string.
