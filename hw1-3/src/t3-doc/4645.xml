<title>
Matching the BPS Spectra of Heterotic - Type I - Type I' Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a detailed discussion of the matching of the BPS states of heterotic,
type I and type I' theories in d=9 for general backgrounds. This allows us to
explicitly identify these (composite) brane states in the type I' theory that
lead to gauge symmetry enhancement at critical points in moduli space. An
example is the enhancement of $SO(16)\times SO(16)$ to $E_8\times E_8$.
