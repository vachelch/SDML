Correlation Functions in Berkovits' Pure Spinor Formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  We use Berkovits' pure spinor quantization to compute various three-point
tree correlation functions in position-space for the Type IIB superstring. We
solve the constraint equations for the vertex operators and obtain explicit
expressions for the graviton and axion components of the vertex operators.
Using these operators we compute tree level correlation functions in flat space
and discuss their extension to the AdS5 X S5 background.
