<title>
Anyonic physical observables and spin phase transition
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantization of charged matter system coupled to Chern-Simons gauge
fields is analyzed in a covariant gauge fixing, and gauge invariant physical
anyon operators satisfying fractional statistics are constructed in a symmetric
phase, based on Dirac's recipe performed on QED. This method provides us a
definite way of identifying physical spectrums free from gauge ambiguity and
constructing physical anyon operators under a covariant gauge fixing. We then
analyze the statistical spin phase transition in a symmetry-broken phase and
show that the Higgs mechanism transmutes an anyon satisfying fractional
statistics into a canonical boson, a spin 0 Higgs boson or a topologically
massive photon.
