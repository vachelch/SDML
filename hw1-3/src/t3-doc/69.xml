<title>
The Low Energy Behavior of some Models with Dynamical Supersymmetry
  Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We study supersymmetric SU(5) chiral gauge theories with 2 fields in the 10
representation, $2+N_F$ fields in the $\bar{5}$ representation and $N_F$ fields
in the 5 representation, for $N_F=0,1,2$. With a suitable superpotential,
supersymmetry is shown to be broken dynamically for each of these values of
$N_F$. We analyze the calculable limit for the model with $N_F=0$ in detail,
and determine the low energy effective sigma model in this case. For $N_F=1$ we
find the quantum moduli space, and for $N_F=2$ we construct the s--confining
potential.
