Non-Abelian, Self-Dual Chern-Simons Vortices Coupled to Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we consider $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons/Higgs theory coupled to
gravity in three-dimensions. It is shown that for a cylindrically symmetric
vortex both the Einstein equations and the field equations can be reduced to a
set of first-order Bogomol'nyi equations provided that we choose a specific
eighth-order potential.
