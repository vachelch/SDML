<title>
Path Integral Evaluation of Non-Abelian Anomaly and
  Pauli--Villars--Gupta Regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  When the path integral method of anomaly evaluation is applied to chiral
gauge theories, two different types of gauge anomaly, i.e., the consistent form
and the covariant form, appear depending on the regularization scheme for the
Jacobian factor. We clarify the relation between the regularization scheme and
the Pauli--Villars--Gupta (PVG) type Lagrangian level regularization. The
conventional PVG, being non-gauge invariant for chiral gauge theories, in
general corresponds to the consistent regularization scheme. The covariant
regularization scheme, on the other hand, is realized by the generalized PVG
Lagrangian recently proposed by Frolov and Slavnov. These correspondences are
clarified by reformulating the PVG method as a regularization of the composite
gauge current operator.
