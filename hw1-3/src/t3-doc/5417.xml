Statistical Properties of Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate numerically the configurational statistics of strings. The
algorithm models an ensemble of global $U(1)$ cosmic strings, or equivalently
vortices in superfluid $^4$He. We use a new method which avoids the
specification of boundary conditions on the lattice. We therefore do not have
the artificial distinction between short and long string loops or a `second
phase' in the string network statistics associated with strings winding around
a toroidal lattice. Our lattice is also tetrahedral, which avoids ambiguities
associated with the cubic lattices of previous work. We find that the
percentage of infinite string is somewhat lower than on cubic lattices, 63\%
instead of 80\%. We also investigate the Hagedorn transition, at which infinite
strings percolate, controlling the string density by rendering one of the
equilibrium states more probable. We measure the percolation threshold, the
critical exponent associated with the divergence of a suitably defined
susceptibility of the string loops, and that associated with the divergence of
the correlation length.
