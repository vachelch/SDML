<title>
Spectral Curves for Super-Yang-Mills with Adjoint Hypermultiplet for
  General Lie Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The Seiberg-Witten curves and differentials for $\N=2$ supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories with one hypermultiplet of mass $m$ in the adjoint
representation of the gauge algebra $\G$, are constructed for arbitrary
classical or exceptional $\G$ (except $G_2$). The curves are obtained from the
recently established Lax pairs with spectral parameter for the (twisted)
elliptic Calogero-Moser integrable systems associated with the algebra $\G$.
Curves and differentials are shown to have the proper group theoretic and
complex analytic structure, and to behave as expected when $m$ tends either to
0 or to $\infty$. By way of example, the prepotential for $\G = D_n$, evaluated
with these techniques, is shown to agree with standard perturbative results. A
renormalization group type equation relating the prepotential to the
Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian is obtained for arbitrary $\G$, generalizing a
previous result for $\G = SU(N)$. Duality properties and decoupling to theories
with other representations are briefly discussed.
