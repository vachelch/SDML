A Membrane Action for OM Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Through direct examination of the effect of the OM limit on the M2-brane
worldvolume action, we derive a membrane action for OM theory, and more
generally, for the eleven-dimensional M-theoretic construct known as Galilean
or Wrapped M2-brane (WM2) theory, which contains OM theory as a special class
of states. In the static gauge, the action in question implies a discrete
spectrum for the closed membrane of WM2 theory, which under double dimensional
reduction is shown to reproduce the known NCOS/Wound closed string spectrum. We
examine as well open membranes ending on each of the three types of M5-branes
in WM2 theory (OM theory arising from the 'longitudinal' type), and show that
the 'fully transverse' fivebrane is tensionless. As a prelude to the membrane,
we also study the case of the string, where we likewise obtain a
reparametrization-invariant action, and make contact with previous work.
