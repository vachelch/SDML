<title>
Geometry and Duality in Supersymmetric sigma-Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The Supersymmetric Dual Sigma Model (SDSM) is a local field theory introduced
to be nonlocally equivalent to the Supersymmetric Chiral nonlinear sigma-Model
(SCM), this dual equivalence being proven by explicit canonical transformation
in tangent space. This model is here reconstructed in superspace and identified
as a chiral-entwined supersymmetrization of the Dual Sigma Model (DSM). This
analysis sheds light on the Boson-Fermion Symphysis of the dual transition, and
on the new geometry of the DSM.
