Relating c<0 and c>0 Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A `canonical mapping' is established between the c=-1 system of bosonic
ghosts and the c=2 complex scalar theory and, a similar mapping between the
c=-2 system of fermionic ghosts and the c=1 Dirac theory. The existence of this
mapping is suggested by the identity of the characters of the respective
theories. The respective c<0 and c>0 theories share the same space of states,
whereas the spaces of conformal fields are different. Upon this mapping from
their c<0 counterparts, the (c>0) complex scalar and the Dirac theories inherit
hidden nonlocal sl(2) symmetries.
