Modified initial state for perturbative QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  A particular initial state for the construction of the perturbative expansion
of QCD is investigated. It is formed as a coherent superposition of zero
momentum gluon pairs and shows Lorentz as well as global SU(3) symmetries. It
follows that the gluon and ghost propagators determined by it, coincides with
the ones used in an alternative of the usual perturbation theory proposed in a
previous work. Therefore, the ability of such a procedure of producing a finite
gluon condensation parameter already in the first orders of perturbation theory
is naturally explained. It also follows that this state satisfies the
physicality condition of the BRST procedure in its Kugo and Ojima formulation.
The BRST quantization is done for the value alpha=1 of the gauge parameter
where the procedure is greatly simplified. Therefore, after assuming that the
adiabatic connection of the interaction does not take out the state from the
interacting physical space, the predictions of the perturbation expansion, at
the value alpha=1, for the physical quantities should have meaning. The
validity of this conclusion solves the gauge dependence indeterminacy remained
in the proposed perturbation expansion.
