Limits on extra dimensions in orbifold compactifications of superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  Perturbative breaking of supersymmetry in four-dimensional string theories
predict in general the existence of new large dimensions at the TeV scale. Such
dimensions can be consistent with perturbative unification up to the Planck
scale in a class of string models and open the exciting possibility of lowering
a part of the massive string spectrum at energies accessible to future
accelerators. The main signature is the production of Kaluza-Klein excitations
which have a very particular structure, strongly correlated with the
supersymmetry breaking mechanism. We present a model independent analysis of
the physics of these states in the context of orbifold compactifications of the
heterotic superstring. In particular, we compute the limits on the size of
large dimensions used to break supersymmetry.
