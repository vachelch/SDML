<title>
Intersecting D3-branes and Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a defect conformal field theory describing D3-branes intersecting
over two space-time dimensions. This theory admits an exact Lagrangian
description which includes both two- and four-dimensional degrees of freedom,
has (4,4) supersymmetry and is invariant under global conformal
transformations. Both two- and four-dimensional contributions to the action are
conveniently obtained in a two-dimensional (2,2) superspace. In a suitable
limit, the theory has a dual description in terms of a probe D3-brane wrapping
an AdS_3 x S^1 slice of AdS_5 x S^5. We consider the AdS/CFT dictionary for
this set-up. In particular we find classical probe fluctuations corresponding
to the holomorphic curve wy=c\alpha^{\prime}. These fluctuations are dual to
defect fields containing massless two-dimensional scalars which parameterize
the classical Higgs branch, but do not correspond to states in the Hilbert
space of the CFT. We also identify probe fluctuations which are dual to BPS
superconformal primary operators and to their descendants. A
non-renormalization theorem is conjectured for the correlators of these
operators, and verified to order g^2.
