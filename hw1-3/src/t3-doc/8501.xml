Geometric Construction of AdS Twistors
</title>

<abstract>
  Time-like geodesics in AdS_4, AdS_5 and AdS_7 are constructed geometrically
and independently of choice of AdS coordinates from division algebra spinors of
the corresponding AdS groups, explaining and generalising the construction by
Claus et al. of AdS_5 twistors.
