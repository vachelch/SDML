On the regularization scheme and gauge choice ambiguities in
  topologically massive gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is demonstrated that in the (2+1)-dimensional topologically massive gauge
theories an agreement of the Pauli-Villars regularization scheme with the other
schemes can be achieved by employing pairs of auxiliary fermions with the
opposite sign masses. This approach does not introduce additional violation of
discrete (P and T) symmetries. Although it breaks the local gauge symmetry only
in the regulator fields' sector, its trace disappears completely after removing
the regularization as a result of superrenormalizability of the model. It is
shown also that analogous extension of the Pauli-Villars regularization in the
vector particle sector can be used to agree the arbitrary covariant gauge
results with the Landau ones. The source of ambiguities in the covariant gauges
is studied in detail. It is demonstrated that in gauges that are softer in the
infrared region (e.g. Coulomb or axial) nonphysical ambiguities inherent to the
covariant gauges do not arise.
