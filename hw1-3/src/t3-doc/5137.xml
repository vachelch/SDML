Classical anomalies for spinning particles
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the phenomenon of classical anomaly. It is observed for 3D
Berezin-Marinov (BM), Barducci-Casalbuoni-Lusanna (BCL) and
Cortes-Plyushchay-Velazquez (CPV) pseudoclassical spin particle models. We show
that quantum mechanically these different models correspond to the same
P,T-invariant system of planar fermions, but the quantum system has global
symmetries being not reproducible classically in full in any of the models. We
demonstrate that the specific U(1) gauge symmetry characterized by the opposite
coupling constants of spin s=+1/2 and s=-1/2 states has a natural classical
analog in CPV model but can be reproduced in BM and BCL models in an obscure
and rather artificial form. We also show that BM and BCL models quantum
mechanically are equivalent in any odd-dimensional space-time, but describe
different quantum systems in even space-time dimensions.
