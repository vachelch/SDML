<title>
Chaotic Coupling Constants
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine some novel physical consequences of the general structure of
moduli spaces of string vacua. These include (1) finiteness of the volume of
the moduli space and (2) chaotic motion of the moduli in the early universe. To
fix ideas we examine in detail the example of the (conjectural) dilaton-axion
``$S$-duality'' of four-dimensional string compactifications. The facts (1) and
(2) together might help to solve some problems with the standard scenarios for
supersymmetry breaking and vacuum selection in string theory.
