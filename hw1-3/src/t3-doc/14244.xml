Confinement and soliton solutions in the SL(3) Toda model coupled to
  matter fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an integrable conformally invariant two dimensional model
associated to the affine Kac-Moody algebra SL(3). It possesses four scalar
fields and six Dirac spinors. The theory does not possesses a local Lagrangian
since the spinor equations of motion present interaction terms which are
bilinear in the spinors. There exists a submodel presenting an equivalence
between a U(1) vector current and a topological current, which leads to a
confinement of the spinors inside the solitons. We calculate the one-soliton
and two-soliton solutions using a procedure which is a hybrid of the dressing
and Hirota methods. The soliton masses and time delays due to the soliton
interactions are also calculated. We give a computer program to calculate the
soliton solutions.
