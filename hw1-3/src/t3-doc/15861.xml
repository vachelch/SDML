Quasitriangularity of quantum groups at roots of 1
</title>

<abstract>
  An important property of a Hopf algebra is its quasitriangularity and it is
useful various applications. This property is investigated for quantum groups
$sl_2$ at roots of 1. It is shown that different forms of the quantum group
$sl_2$ at roots of 1 are either quasitriangular or have similar structure which
will be called autoquasitriangularity. In the most interesting cases this
property means that "braiding automorphism" is a combination of some Poisson
transformation and an adjoint transformation with certain element of the tensor
square of the algebra.
