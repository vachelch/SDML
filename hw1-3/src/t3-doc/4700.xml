<title>
M-brane interpolations and (2,0) Renormalization Group flow
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the M5-M2-MW bound state solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity
corresponding to the 1/2 supersymmetric vacua of the M5-brane equations with
constant background fields. In the `near-horizon' case the solution
interpolates between the $adS_7\times S^4$ Kaluza-Klein vacuum and D=11
Minkowski spacetime via a Domain Wall spacetime. We discuss implications for
renormalization group flow of (2,0) D=6 field theories.
