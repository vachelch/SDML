<title>
Spectral correlations of the massive QCD Dirac operator at finite
  temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the graded eigenvalue method, a variant of the supersymmetry
technique, to compute the universal spectral correlations of the QCD Dirac
operator in the presence of massive dynamical quarks. The calculation is done
for the chiral Gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrix theory with an
arbitrary Hermitian matrix added to the Dirac matrix. This case is of interest
for schematic models of QCD at finite temperature.
