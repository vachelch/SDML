Heat-kernel Coefficients and Spectra of the Vector Laplacians on
  Spherical Domains with Conical Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  The spherical domains $S^d_\beta$ with conical singularities are a convenient
arena for studying the properties of tensor Laplacians on arbitrary manifolds
with such a kind of singular points. In this paper the vector Laplacian on
$S^d_\beta$ is considered and its spectrum is calculated exactly for any
dimension $d$. This enables one to find the Schwinger-DeWitt coefficients of
this operator by using the residues of the $\zeta$-function. In particular,
the second coefficient, defining the conformal anomaly, is explicitly
calculated on $S^d_\beta$ and its generalization to arbitrary manifolds is
found. As an application of this result, the standard renormalization of the
one-loop effective action of gauge fields is demonstrated to be sufficient to
remove the ultraviolet divergences up to the first order in the conical deficit
angle.
