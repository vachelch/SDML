The Luttinger-Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Luttinger-Schwinger model, i.e. the (1+1) dimensional model of
massless Dirac fermions with a non-local 4-point interaction coupled to a
U(1)-gauge field. The complete solution of the model is found using the
boson-fermion correspondence, and the formalism for calculating all gauge
invariant Green functions is provided. We discuss the role of anomalies and
show how the existence of large gauge transformations implies a fermion
condensate in all physical states. The meaning of regularization and
renormalization in our well-defined Hilbert space setting is discussed. We
illustrate the latter by performing the limit to the Thirring-Schwinger model
where the interaction becomes local.
