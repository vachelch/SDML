Remarks on Fundamental String Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  In recent work, it was shown that velocity-dependent forces between moving
strings or branes lead to an accelerating expanding universe without assuming
the existence of a cosmological constant. Here we show that the repulsive
velocity-dependent force arises in more general contexts and can lead to cosmic
structure formation.
