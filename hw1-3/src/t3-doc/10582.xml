<title>
Environmentally Friendly Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the renormalization of systems whose effective degrees of freedom
are described in terms of fluctuations which are ``environment'' dependent.
Relevant environmental parameters considered are: temperature, system size,
boundary conditions, and external fields. The points in the space of \lq\lq
coupling constants'' at which such systems exhibit scale invariance coincide
only with the fixed points of a global renormalization group which is
necessarily environment dependent. Using such a renormalization group we give
formal expressions to two loops for effective critical exponents for a generic
crossover induced by a relevant mass scale $g$. These effective exponents are
seen to obey scaling laws across the entire crossover, including hyperscaling,
but in terms of an effective dimensionality, $d\ef=4-\gl$, which represents the
effects of the leading irrelevant operator. We analyze the crossover of an
$O(N)$ model on a $d$ dimensional layered geometry with periodic, antiperiodic
and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Explicit results to two loops for effective
exponents are obtained using a [2,1] Pad\'e resummed coupling, for: the
``Gaussian model'' ($N=-2$), spherical model ($N=\infty$), Ising Model ($N=1$),
polymers ($N=0$), XY-model ($N=2$) and Heisenberg ($N=3$) models in four
dimensions. We also give two loop Pad\'e resummed results for a three
dimensional Ising ferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field and corresponding
one loop results for the two dimensional model. One loop results are also
presented for a three dimensional layered Ising model with Dirichlet and
antiperiodic boundary conditions. Asymptotically the effective exponents are in
excellent agreement with known results.
