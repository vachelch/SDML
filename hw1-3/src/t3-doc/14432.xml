Intersecting M-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the magnetic duals of G\"uven's electric-type solutions of D=11
supergravity preserving $1/4$ or $1/8$ of the D=11 supersymmetry. We interpret
the electric solutions as $n$ orthogonal intersecting membranes and the
magnetic solutions as $n$ orthogonal intersecting 5-branes, with $n=2,3$; these
cases obey the general rule that $p$-branes can self-intersect on
$(p-2)$-branes. On reduction to $D=4$ these solutions become electric or
magnetic dilaton black holes with dilaton coupling constant $a=1$ (for $n=2$)
or $a=1/\sqrt{3}$ (for $n=3$). We also discuss the reduction to D=10.
