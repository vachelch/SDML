Geometric Interpretation of Schwarzschild Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we address the problem of finding Abelian instantons of finite
energy on the Euclidean Schwarzschild manifold. This amounts to construct
self-dual L^2 harmonic 2-forms on the space. Gibbons found a non-topological
L^2 harmonic form in the Taub-NUT metric, leading to Abelian instantons with
continuous energy. We imitate his construction in the case of the Euclidean
Schwarzschild manifold and find a non-topological self-dual L^2 harmonic 2-form
on it. We show how this gives rise to Abelian instantons and identify them with
SU(2)-instantons of Pontryagin number 2n^2 found by Charap and Duff in 1977.
Using results of Dodziuk and Hitchin we also calculate the full L^2 harmonic
space for the Euclidean Schwarzschild manifold.
