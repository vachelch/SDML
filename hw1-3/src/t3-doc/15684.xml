<title>
Model of statistically coupled chiral fields on the circle
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from a field theoretical description of multicomponent anyons with
mutual statistical interactions in the lowest Landau level, we construct a
model of interacting chiral fields on the circle, with the energy spectrum
characterized by a symmetric matrix $g_{\alpha\beta}$ with nonnegative entries.
Being represented in a free form, the model provides a field theoretical
realization of (ideal) fractional exclusion statistics for particles with
linear dispersion, with $g_{\alpha\beta}$ as a statistics matrix. We derive the
bosonized form of the model and discuss the relation to the effective
low-energy description of the edge excitations for abelian fractional quantum
Hall states in multilayer systems.
