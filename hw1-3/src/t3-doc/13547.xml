Landau-Ginzburg Description of D-branes on ALE Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Landau-Ginzburg (LG) mirror theory of the non-linear sigma model
on the ALE space ${\cal M}$ obtained by resolving the singularity of the
orbifold ${\bf C}^2/{\bf Z}_N$. In the LG description, the data of the BPS
spectrum and the lines of marginal stability are encoded in the special
Lagrangian submanifolds of the mirror manifold $\hat{{\cal M}}$. Our LG
description is quite simple as compared with the quiver gauge theory analysis
near the orbifold point. Furthermore our mirror analysis can be applied to any
point on the moduli space of ${\cal M}$.
