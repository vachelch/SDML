<title>
Yang-Mills theory in terms of gauge invariant dual variables
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum Yang-Mills theory and the Wilson loop can be rewritten identically in
terms of local gauge-invariant variables being directly related to the metric
of the dual space. In this formulation, one reveals a hidden high local
symmetry of the Yang-Mills theory, which mixes up fields with spins up to J=N
for the SU(N) gauge group. In the simplest case of the SU(2) group the dual
space seems to tend to the de Sitter space in the infrared region. This
observation suggests a new mechanism of gauge-invariant mass generation in the
Yang-Mills theory.
