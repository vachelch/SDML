Supermatrix models for M-theory based on osp(1|32,R)
</title>

<abstract>
  Taking seriously the hypothesis that the full symmetry algebra of M-theory is
osp(1|32,R), we derive the supersymmetry transformations for all fields that
appear in 11- and 12-dimensional realizations and give the associated SUSY
algebras. We study the background-independent osp(1|32,R) cubic matrix model
action expressed in terms of representations of the Lorentz groups SO(10,2) and
SO(10,1). We explore further the 11-dimensional case and compute an effective
action for the BFSS-like degrees of freedom. We find the usual BFSS action with
additional terms incorporating couplings to transverse 5-branes, as well as a
mass-term and an infinite tower of higher-order interactions.
