<title>
c=1 discrete states correlators via W$_{1+\infty}$ constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  The discrete states of $c=1$ string theory at the self-dual radius are
associated with modes of $W_{1+\infty}$ currents and their genus zero
correlators are computed. An analogy to a recent suggestion based on the
integrable structure of the theory is found. An iterative method for deriving
the dependence of the currents on the full space of couplings is presented and
applied. The dilaton equation of the theory is derived.
