On the equivalence between sine-Gordon model and Thirring model in the
  chirally broken phase of the Thirring model
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the equivalence between Thirring model and sine-Gordon model
in the chirally broken phase of the Thirring model. This is unlike all other
available approaches where the fermion fields of the Thirring model were
quantized in the chiral symmetric phase. In the path integral approach we show
that the bosonized version of the massless Thirring model is described by a
quantum field theory of a massless scalar field and exactly solvable, and the
massive Thirring model bosonizes to the sine-Gordon model with a new relation
between coupling constants. We show that the non-perturbative vacuum of the
chirally broken phase in the massless Thirring model can be described in
complete analogy with the BCS ground state of superconductivity. The
Mermin-Wagner theorem and Coleman's statement concerning the absence of
Goldstone bosons in the 1+1-dimensional quantum field theories are discussed.
We investigate the current algebra in the massless Thirring model and give a
new value of the Schwinger term. We show that the topological current in the
sine-Gordon model coincides with the Noether current responsible for the
conservation of the fermion number in the Thirring model. This allows to
identify the topological charge in the sine-Gordon model with the fermion
number.
