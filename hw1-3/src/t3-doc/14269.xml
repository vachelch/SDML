Quantization of maximally-charged slowly-moving black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the quantization of a system of slowly-moving extreme
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. In the near-horizon limit, this system has been
shown to possess an SL(2,R) conformal symmetry. However, the Hamiltonian
appears to have no well-defined ground state. This problem can be circumvented
by a redefinition of the Hamiltonian due to de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan (DFF).
We apply the Faddeev-Popov quantization procedure to show that the Hamiltonian
with no ground state corresponds to a gauge in which there is an obstruction at
the singularities of moduli space requiring a modification of the quantization
rules. The redefinition of the Hamiltonian a la DFF corresponds to a different
choice of gauge. The latter is a good gauge leading to standard quantization
rules. Thus, the DFF trick is a consequence of a standard gauge-fixing
procedure in the case of black hole scattering.
