<title>
Complex Matrix Models and Statistics of Branched Coverings of 2D
  Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a complex matrix gauge model defined on an arbitrary
two-dimensional orientable lattice. We rewrite the model's partition function
in terms of a sum over representations of the group U(N). The model solves the
general combinatorial problem of counting branched covers of orientable Riemann
surfaces with any given, fixed branch point structure. We then define an
appropriate continuum limit allowing the branch points to freely float over the
surface. The simplest such limit reproduces two-dimensional chiral U(N)
Yang-Mills theory and its string description due to Gross and Taylor.
