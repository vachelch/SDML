<title>
Free Boson Representation of $DY_{\hbar}(sl_2)_k$ and the Deformation of
  the Feigin-Fuchs
</title>

<abstract>
  A realization of the Yangian double with center $DY_\hbar(sl_2)_k$ of level
$k(\not=0,-2)$ in terms of free boson fields is constructed. The screening
currents are also presented, which commute with $DY_\hbar(sl_2)$ modulo total
difference. In the $\hbar\to 0$ limit, the currents of Yangian double
$DY_\hbar(sl_2)_k$ becomes the Feigin-Fuchs realization of affine Lie
$sl(2)_k$, while the screening currents of Yangian double $DY_\hbar(sl_2)_k$
becomes the screening currents of the affine Lie algebra $sl(2)_k$.
