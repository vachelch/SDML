Calculation of Higher Mass-Dimensional Effective Lagrangians in Quantum
  Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A prescription for calculating low-energy one-loop higher-mass dimensional
effective Lagrangians for non-Abelian field theories is constructed in the
spirit of quasilocal background field method. Basis of Lorentz and
gauge-invariant monomials of similar mass-dimensions acting as building blocks
are matrix-multiplied in a specified order (usually dictated by a permutation
of tensorial indices) generating the much needed invariants. The same set of
building blocks is used to generate higher-order corrections for a specific
mass-dimension. Though the gauge group, the spacetime dimensions, the order of
corrections that can be included, and the mass-dimensions that can be formed
are all kept arbitrary in the prescription, we constructed basis invariants
from 3 up to 12 mass-dimensions to accommodate higher-order corrections up to
fourth-order. With these basis, we pursued solving the zeroth-order corrections
leading to invariants from 2 up to 16 mass-dimensions, for first-order from 4
up to 8 mass-dimensions, second and third order corrections from 6 up to 8
mass-dimensions. As a result, we have reproduced the zeroth-order corrections
showing dependence on the covariant derivative of the background matrix
potential. Previous calculation was done up to 12 mass-dimensions but this
dependence was not shown in closed form. For higher-order corrections, the case
for 4 up to 6 mass-dimensions are also reproduced. Finally, we calculated the
case for 8 mass-dimensions which is reduced only by exploiting the antisymmetry
of the fieldstrength tensor and the freedom to throw away total derivatives.
