<title>
Holography and the generalized second law of thermodynamics in
  (2+1)-dimensional cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  The Fischler-Susskind entropy bound has been studied in (2+1)-dimensional
universes with negative cosmological constant. As in all contracting universes,
that bound is not satisfied. Furthermore, we found that the Fischler-Susskind
bound is not compatible with a generalized second law of thermodynamics in
(2+1)-dimensional cosmology, neither the classical nor the quantum version. On
the other hand, the Hubble entropy bound has been constructed in
(2+1)-dimensional cosmology and it is shown compatible with the generalized
second law of thermodynamics.
