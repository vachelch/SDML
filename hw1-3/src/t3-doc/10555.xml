New remarks on the linear constraint self-dual boson and Wess-Zumino
  terms
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we prove in a precise way that the soldering formalism can be
applied to the Srivastava chiral boson (SCB), in contradiction with some
results appearing in the literature. We have promoted a canonical
transformation that shows directly that the SCB is composed of two
Floreanini-Jackiw's particles with the same chirality which spectrum is a
vacuum-like one. As another conflictive result we have proved that a
Wess-Zumino term used in the literature consists of the scalar field, once
again denying the assertion that the WZ term adds a new degree of freedom to
the SCB theory in order to modify the physics of the system.
