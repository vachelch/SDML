Brane factories

<abstract>
  We propose that higher-dimensional extended objects (p-branes) are created by
super-Planckian scattering processes in theories with TeV scale gravity. As an
example, we compute the cross section for p-brane creation in a
(n+4)-dimensional spacetime with asymmetric compactification. We find that the
cross section for the formation of a brane which is wounded on a compact
submanifold of size of the fundamental gravitational scale is larger than the
cross section for the creation of a spherically symmetric black hole.
Therefore, we predict that branes are more likely to be created than black
holes in super-Planckian scattering processes in these manifolds. The higher
rate of p-brane production has important phenomenological consequences, as it
significantly enhances possible detection of non-perturbative gravitational
events in future hadron colliders and cosmic rays detectors.
