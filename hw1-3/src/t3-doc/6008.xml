Higher-loop anomalies in chiral gravities
</title>

<abstract>
  The one-loop anomalies for chiral $W_{3}$ gravity are derived using the
Fujikawa regularisation method. The expected two-loop anomalies are then
obtained by imposing the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions on the one-loop
results. The anomalies found in this way agree with those already known from
explicit Feynman diagram calculations. We then directly verify that the order
$\hbar^2$ non-local BRST Ward identity anomalies, arising from the ``dressing''
of the one-loop results, satisfy Lam's theorem. It is also shown that in a
rigorous calculation of $Q^2$ anomaly for the BRST charge, one recovers both
the non-local as well as the local anomalies. We further verify that, in chiral
gravities, the non-local anomalies in the BRST Ward identity can be obtained by
the application of the anomalous operator $Q^2$, calculated using operator
products, to an appropriately defined gauge fermion. Finally, we give arguments
to show why this relation should hold generally in reparametrisation-invariant
theories.
