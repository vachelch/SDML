<title>
Deconstructed U(1) and Supersymmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss supersymmetry breaking induced by simultaneous presence of a
Wilson-line type superpotential and boundary-localized Fayet-Iliopoulos terms
in a four dimensional theory based on deconstruction of five-dimensional
abelian gauge theories on orbifolds. Large hierarchy between the scale of
supersymmetry breaking and the fundamental scale can be generated dynamically.
The model has several potentially interesting phenomenological applications. We
also discuss the conditions that are necessary for interpreting our $U(1)^N$
model as an ultra-violet completion of some 5d theory. In particular, the
corresponding 5d theory contains Chern-Simons couplings.
