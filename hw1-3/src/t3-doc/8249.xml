Scaling Limits of the Fuzzy Sphere at one Loop
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the one loop dynamics of QFT on the fuzzy sphere and calculate the
planar and nonplanar contributions to the two point function at one loop. We
show that there is no UV/IR mixing on the fuzzy sphere. The fuzzy sphere is
characterized by two moduli: a dimensionless parameter N and a dimensionful
radius R. Different geometrical phases can obtained at different corners of the
moduli space. In the limit of the commutative sphere, we find that the two
point function is regular without UV/IR mixing; however quantization does not
commute with the commutative limit, and a finite ``noncommutative anomaly''
survives in the commutative limit. In a different limit, the noncommutative
plane R^2_theta is obtained, and the UV/IR mixing reappears. This provides an
explanation of the UV/IR mixing as an infinite variant of the ``noncommutative
anomaly''.
