<title>
Topologically massive nonabelian BF models in arbitrary space-time
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  This work extends to the D-dimensional space-time the topological mass
generation mechanism of the nonabelian BF model in four dimensions. In order to
construct the gauge invariant nonabelian kinetic terms for a (D-2)-form B and a
1-form A, we introduce an auxiliary (D-3)-form V. Furthermore, we obtain a
complete set of BRST and anti-BRST transformation rules of the fields using the
so called horizontality condition, and construct a BRST/anti-BRST invariant
quantum action for the model in D-dimensional space-time.
