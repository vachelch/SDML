<title>
AdS/CFT correspondence and D1/D5 systems in theories with 16
  supercharges
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss spectra of $AdS_3$ supergravities, arising in the near horizon
geometry of D1/D5 systems in orbifolds/orientifolds of type IIB theory with 16
supercharges. These include models studied in a recent paper (hep-th/0012118),
where the group action involves also a shift along a transversal circle, as
well as IIB/$\Omega I_4$, which is dual to IIB on $K3$. After appropriate
assignements of the orbifold group eigenvalues and degrees to the supergravity
single particle spectrum, we compute the supergravity elliptic genus and find
agreement, in the expected regime of validity, with the elliptic genus obtained
using U-duality map from (4,4) CFTs of U-dual backgrounds. Since this U-duality
involves the exchange of KK momentum $P$ and D1 charge $N$, it allows us to
test the (4,4) CFTs in the $P < N/4$ and $N < P/4$ regimes by two different
supergravity duals.
