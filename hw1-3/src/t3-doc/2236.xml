<title>
The Virtual Black Hole in 2d Quantum Gravity and its Relevance for the
  S-matrix
</title>

<abstract>
  As shown recently 2d quantum gravity theories -- including spherically
reduced Einstein-gravity -- after an exact path integral of its geometric part
can be treated perturbatively in the loops of (scalar) matter. Obviously the
classical mechanism of black hole formation should be contained in the tree
approximation of the theory. This is shown to be the case for the scattering of
two scalars through an intermediate state which by its effective black hole
mass is identified as a "virtual black hole". We discuss the lowest order tree
vertex for minimally and non-minimally coupled scalars and find a non-trivial
finite S-matrix for gravitational s-wave scattering in the latter case.
