<title>
Boundary Quantum Field Theories with Infinite Resonance States
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend a recent work by Mussardo and Penati on integrable quantum field
theories with a single stable particle and an infinite number of unstable
resonance states, including the presence of a boundary. The corresponding
scattering and reflection amplitudes are expressed in terms of Jacobian
elliptic functions, and generalize the ones of the massive thermal Ising model
and of the Sinh-Gordon model. In the case of the generalized Ising model we
explicitly study the ground state energy and the one-point function of the
thermal operator in the short-distance limit, finding an oscillating behaviour
related to the fact that the infinite series of boundary resonances does not
decouple from the theory even at very short-distance scales. The analysis of
the generalized Sinh-Gordon model with boundary reveals an interesting
constraint on the analytic structure of the reflection amplitude. The roaming
limit procedure which leads to the Ising model, in fact, can be consistently
performed only if we admit that the nature of the bulk spectrum uniquely fixes
the one of resonance states on the boundary.
