<title>
Yangian Symmetry in Integrable Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Dimensional reduction of various gravity and supergravity models leads to
effectively two-dimensional field theories described by gravity coupled G/H
coset space sigma-models. The transition matrices of the associated linear
system provide a complete set of conserved charges. Their Poisson algebra is a
semi-classical Yangian double modified by a twist which is a remnant of the
underlying coset structure. The classical Geroch group is generated by the
Lie-Poisson action of these charges. Canonical quantization of the structure
leads to a twisted Yangian double with fixed central extension at a critical
level.
