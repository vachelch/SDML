Chern-Simons Hadronic Bag from Quenched Large-N QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  SU(N) reduced, quenched, gauge theories have been shown to be related to
string theories. We extend this result and show how a 4-dimensional, reduced,
quenched, Yang-Mills theory, supplemented by the topological term, can be
related through the Wigner-Weyl-Moyal correspondence to an open 3-brane model.
The boundary of the 3-brane is described by a Chern-Simons 2-brane. We identify
the bulk of the 3-brane with the interior of a hadronic bag and the
world-volume of the Chern-Simons 2-brane with the dynamical boundary of the
bag. We estimate the value of the induced bag constant to be a little less than
200MeV.
