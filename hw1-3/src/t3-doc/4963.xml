AdS_2 Supergravity and Superconformal Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the asymptotic dynamics of topological anti-de Sitter
supergravity in two dimensions. Starting from the formulation as a BF theory,
it is shown that the AdS_2 boundary conditions imply that the asymptotic
symmetries form a super-Virasoro algebra. Using the central charge of this
algebra in Cardy's formula, we exactly reproduce the thermodynamical entropy of
AdS_2 black holes. Furthermore, we show that the dynamics of the dilaton and
its superpartner reduces to that of superconformal transformations that leave
invariant one chiral component of the stress tensor supercurrent of a
two-dimensional conformal field theory. This dynamics is governed by a
supersymmetric extension of the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model of conformal
quantum mechanics. Finally, two-dimensional de Sitter gravity is also
considered, and the dS_2 entropy is computed by counting CFT states.
