<title>
On Foundation of the Generalized Nambu Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We outline the basic principles of canonical formalism for the Nambu
mechanics---a generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics proposed by Yoichiro
Nambu in 1973. It is based on the notion of Nambu bracket which generalizes the
Poisson bracket to the multiple operation of higher order $n \geq 3$ on
classical observables and is described by Hambu-Hamilton equations of motion
given by $n-1$ Hamiltonians. We introduce the fundamental identity for the
Nambu bracket which replaces Jacobi identity as a consistency condition for the
dynamics. We show that Nambu structure of given order defines a family of
subordinated structures of lower order, including the Poisson structure,
satisfying certain matching conditions. We introduce analogs of action from and
principle of the least action for the Nambu mechanics and show how dynamics of
loops ($n-2$-dimensional objects) naturally appears in this formalism. We
discuss several approaches to the quantization problem and present explicit
representation of Nambu-Heisenberg commutation relation for $n=3$ case. We
emphasize the role higher order algebraic operations and mathematical
structures related with them play in passing from Hamilton's to Nambu's
dynamical picture.
