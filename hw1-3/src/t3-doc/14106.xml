<title>
Family Unification from Universality
</title>

<abstract>
  A direct consequence of the occurrence of fermion families is the invariance
of currents under certain groups of (universality) transformations. We show how
these universality groups can themselves be used to find and study grand family
unification models. Identifying two independent - weak and strong -
universality groups and assuming that the grand unification group is SU(8N),
its subgroup respecting either weak or strong universality is shown to be G =
SU(2)xU(1)xSU(3). The fundamental representation of SU(8N) decomposes as N
families of leptons and quarks. In the G-invariant limit, all fermions are
left-handed. A mechanism for generating the correct number of right-handed
fermions with the correct couplings so as to give pure vector colour and
electromagnetic currents is exhibited. Universality is shown to result most
naturally from a preonic structure of fermions. In such a preonic picture there
are no ultraheavy gauge bosons and no anomaly or hierarchy problem.
