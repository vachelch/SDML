Postmodern String Theory: Stochastic Formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the dynamics of a statistical ensemble of strings,
building on a recently proposed gauge theory of the string geodesic field. We
show that this stochastic approach is equivalent to the Carath\'eodory
formulation of the Nambu-Goto action, supplemented by an averaging procedure
over the family of classical string world-sheets which are solutions of the
equation of motion. In this new framework, the string geodesic field is
reinterpreted as the Gibbs current density associated with the string
statistical ensemble. Next, we show that the classical field equations derived
from the string gauge action, can be obtained as the semi-classical limit of
the string functional wave equation. For closed strings, the wave equation
itself is completely analogous to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation used in quantum
cosmology. Thus, in the string case, the wave function has support on the space
of all possible spatial loop configurations. Finally, we show that the string
distribution induces a multi-phase, or {\it cellular} structure on the
spacetime manifold characterized by domains with a purely Riemannian geometry
separated by domain walls over which there exists a predominantly Weyl
geometry.
