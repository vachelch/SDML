<title>
Test of the Absence of Kinetic Terms around the Tachyon Vacuum in Cubic
  String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been conjectured that the bosonic open string theory around the
non-perturbative tachyon vacuum has no open string dynamics at all. We explore,
in the cubic open string field theory with level truncation approximation, the
possibility that this conjecture is realized by the absence of kinetic terms of
the string field fluctuations. We study the kinetic terms with two and four
derivatives for the lower level scalar modes as well as their BRST
transformation properties. The behavior of the coefficients of the kinetic
terms in the neighborhood of the non-perturbative vacuum supports our
expectation that the BRST invariant scalar component lacks its kinetic term.
