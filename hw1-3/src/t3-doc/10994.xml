<title>
Oblate, Toroidal, and Other Shapes for the Enhancon
</title>

<abstract>
  We present some results of studying certain axially symmetric supergravity
geometries corresponding to a distribution of BPS D6-branes wrapped on K3,
obtained as extremal limits of a rotating solution. The geometry's unphysical
regions resulting from the wrapping can be repaired by the enhancon mechanism,
with the result that there are two nested enhancon shells. For a range of
parameters, the two shells merge into a single toroidal surface. Given the
quite intricate nature of the geometry, it is an interesting system in which to
test previous techniques that have been brought to bear in spherically
symmetric situations. We are able to check the consistency of the construction
using supergravity surgery techniques, and probe brane results. Implications
for the Coulomb branch of (2+1)-dimensional pure SU(N) gauge theory are
extracted from the geometry. Related results for wrapped D4- and D5-brane
distributions are also discussed.
