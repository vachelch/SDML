<title>
Kink Dynamics in a Topological Phi^4 Lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  It was recently proposed a novel discretization for nonlinear Klein-Gordon
field theories in which the resulting lattice preserves the topological
(Bogomol'nyi) lower bound on the kink energy and, as a consequence, has no
Peierls-Nabarro barrier even for large spatial discretizations (h~1.0). It was
then suggested that these ``topological discrete systems'' are a natural choice
for the numerical study of continuum kink dynamics. Giving particular emphasis
to the phi^4 theory, we numerically investigate kink-antikink scattering and
breather formation in these topological lattices. Our results indicate that,
even though these systems are quite accurate for studying free kinks in coarse
lattices, for legitimate dynamical kink problems the accuracy is rather
restricted to fine lattices (h~0.1). We suggest that this fact is related to
the breaking of the Bogomol'nyi bound during the kink-antikink interaction,
where the field profile loses its static property as required by the
Bogomol'nyi argument. We conclude, therefore, that these lattices are not
suitable for the study of more general kink dynamics, since a standard
discretization is simpler and has effectively the same accuracy for such
resolutions.
