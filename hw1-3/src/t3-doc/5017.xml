Open Strings in the SL(2,R) WZWN Model with Solution for a Rigidly
  Rotating String
</title>

<abstract>
  Boundary conditions and gluing conditions for open strings and D-branes in
the $SL(2,R)$ WZWN model, corresponding to $AdS_3$, are discussed. Some
boundary conditions and gluing conditions previously considered in the
literature are shown to be incompatible with the variation principle.
  We then consider open string boundary conditions corresponding to a certain
{\it field-dependent} gluing condition. This allows us to consider open strings
with constant energy and angular momentum. Classically, these open strings
naturally generalize the open strings in flat Minkowski space. For rigidly
rotating open strings, we show that the torsion leads to a bending and an
unfolding. We also derive the $SL(2,R)$ Regge relation, which generalizes the
linear Minkowski Regge relation. For "high" mass, it takes the form $L\approx
\pm M/H$, where $H$ is the scale of the $SL(2,R)$ group manifold.
