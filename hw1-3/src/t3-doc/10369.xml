<title>
Warped brane-world compactification with Gauss-Bonnet term
</title>

<abstract>
  In the Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane-world model a singular delta-function
source is matched by the second derivative of the warp factor. So one should
take possible curvature corrections in the effective action of the RS models in
a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) form. We present a linearized treatment of gravity in the
RS brane-world with the Gauss-Bonnet modification to Einstein gravity. We give
explicit expressions for the Neumann propagator in arbitrary $D$ dimensions and
show that a bulk GB term gives, along with a tower of Kaluza-Klein modes in the
bulk, a massless graviton on the brane, as in the standard RS model. Moreover,
a non-trivial GB coupling can allow a new branch of solutions with finite
Planck scale and no naked bulk singularity, which might be useful to avoid some
of the previously known "no--go theorems" for a RS brane-world type
compactification.
