<title>
Cosmological Models and Renormalization Group Flow
</title>

<abstract>
  We study cosmological solutions of Einstein gravity with a positive
cosmological constant in diverse dimensions. These include big-bang models that
re-collapse, big-bang models that approach de Sitter acceleration at late
times, and bounce models that are both past and future asymptotically de
Sitter. The re-collapsing and the bounce geometries are all tall in the sense
that entire spatial slices become visible to a comoving observer before the end
of conformal time, while the accelerating big-bang geometries can be either
short or tall. We consider the interpretation of these cosmological solutions
as renormalization group flows in a dual field theory and give a geometric
interpretation of the associated c-function as the area of the apparent
cosmological horizon in Planck units. The covariant entropy bound requires
quantum effects to modify the early causal structure of some of our big-bang
solutions.
