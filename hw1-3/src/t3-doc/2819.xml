<title>
Curved Four-Dimensional Spacetime as Infrared Regulator in Superstring
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a new class of exact and stable superstring solutions in which
our four-dimensional spacetime is taken to be curved . We derive in this space
the full one-loop partition function in the presence of non-zero $\langle
F^a_{\mu\nu}F_a^{\mu\nu}\rangle=F^2$ gauge background as well as in an $\langle
R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\rangle=\R^2$ gravitational background
and we show that the non-zero curvature, $Q^2=2/(k+2)$, of the spacetime
provides an infrared regulator for all
$\langle[F^a_{\mu\nu}]^n[R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}]^m\rangle$ correlation functions.
The string one-loop partition function $Z(F,\R, Q)$ can be exactly computed,
and it is IR and UV finite. For $Q$ small we have thus obtained an IR
regularization, consistent with spacetime supersymmetry (when $F=0,\R=0$) and
modular invariance. Thus, it can be used to determine, without any infrared
ambiguities, the one-loop string radiative corrections on gravitational, gauge
or Yukawa couplings necessary for the string superunification predictions at
low energies. (To appear in the Proceedings of the Trieste Spring 94 Workshop)
