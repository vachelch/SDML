Lie bialgebra contractions and quantum deformations of quasi-orthogonal
  algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Lie bialgebra contractions are introduced and classified. A non-degenerate
coboundary bialgebra structure is implemented into all pseudo-orthogonal
algebras $so(p,q)$ starting from the one corresponding to $so(N+1)$. It allows
to introduce a set of Lie bialgebra contractions which leads to Lie bialgebras
of quasi-orthogonal algebras. This construction is explicitly given for the
cases $N=2,3,4$. All Lie bialgebra contractions studied in this paper define
Hopf algebra contractions for the Drinfel'd-Jimbo deformations $U_z so(p,q)$.
They are explicitly used to generate new non-semisimple quantum algebras as it
is the case for the Euclidean, Poincar\'e and Galilean algebras.
