Relating Green's Functions in Axial and Lorentz Gauges using Finite
  Field-Dependent BRS Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  We use finite field-dependent BRS transformations (FFBRS) to connect the
Green functions in a set of two otherwise unrelated gauge choices. We choose
the Lorentz and the axial gauges as examples. We show how the Green functions
in axial gauge can be written as a series in terms of those in Lorentz gauges.
Our method also applies to operator Green's functions. We show that this
process involves another set of related FFBRS transfomations that is derivable
from infinitesimal FBRS. We suggest possible applications.
