<title>
Exact renormalization group equations and the field theoretical approach
  to critical phenomena
</title>

<abstract>
  After a brief presentation of the exact renormalization group equation, we
illustrate how the field theoretical (perturbative) approach to critical
phenomena takes place in the more general Wilson (nonperturbative) approach.
Notions such as the continuum limit and the renormalizability and the presence
of singularities in the perturbative series are discussed.
