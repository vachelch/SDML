Path Integral Approach to String Theory on AdS_3
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the path integral approach, we discuss the correlation functions of the
$SL(2,\bfC)/SU(2)$ WZW model, which corresponds to the string theory on the
Euclidean $AdS_3$. We obtain the two- and three-point functions for generic
primary fields in closed forms. By an appropriate change of the normalization
of the primary fields, our results coincide with those by Teschner, which were
obtained by using the bootstrap approach. The supergravity results are also
obtained in the semi-classical limit.
