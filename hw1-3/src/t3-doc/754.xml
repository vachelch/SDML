<title>
Bidyon or an electromagnetic model for charged particle with spin
</title>

<abstract>
  The general model of nonlinear electrodynamics with dyon singularities is
considered. We introduce the field configuration having two dyon singularities
with identical electric and opposite magnetic charges and we name it as bidyon.
We investigate the sum of two dyon solution as initial approximation to the
bidyon solution. We consider the case when the velocities of the dyons have
equal modules and opposite directions on a common line. It is shown that the
associated field configuration has a constant full angular momentum which is
independent of the interdyonic distance and their speed. This property permits
a consideration of this bidyon configuration as an electromagnetic model for
charged particle with spin. We discuss the possible electrodynamic world with
oscillating bidyons as particles.
