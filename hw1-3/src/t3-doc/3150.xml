<title>
D=26 and Exact Solution to the Conformal-Gauge Two-Dimensional Quantum
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The conformal-gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity is formulated in the
framework of the BRS quantization and solved completely in the Heisenberg
picture: All n-point Wightman functions are explicitly obtained. The
field-equation anomaly is shown to exist as in other gauges, but there is no
other subtlety. At the critical dimension D=26 of the bosonic string, the
field-equation anomaly is shown to be absent. However, this result is not
equivalent to the statement that the conformal anomaly is proportional to D-26.
The existence of the FP-ghost number current anomaly is seen to be an illusion.
