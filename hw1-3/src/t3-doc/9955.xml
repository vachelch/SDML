<title>
Large-N limit of the generalized 2D Yang-Mills theory on cylinder
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the collective field theory approach of large-N generalized
two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on cylinder, it is shown that the classical
equation of motion of collective field is a generalized Hopf equation. Then,
using the Itzykson-Zuber integral at the large-N limit, it is found that the
classical Young tableau density, which satisfies the saddle-point equation and
determines the large-N limit of free energy, is the inverse of the solution of
this generalized Hopf equation, at a certain point.
