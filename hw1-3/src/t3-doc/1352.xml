<title>
An N=2 gauge theory and its supergravity dual
</title>

<abstract>
  We study flows on the scalar manifold of N=8 gauged supergravity in five
dimensions which are dual to certain mass deformations of N=4 super Yang--Mills
theory. In particular, we consider a perturbation of the gauge theory by a mass
term for the adjoint hyper-multiplet, giving rise to an N=2 theory. The exact
solution of the 5-dim gauged supergravity equations of motion is found and the
metric is uplifted to a ten-dimensional background of type-IIB supergravity.
Using these geometric data and the AdS/CFT correspondence we analyze the
spectra of certain operators as well as Wilson loops on the dual gauge theory
side. The physical flows are parametrized by a single non-positive constant and
describe part of the Coulomb branch of the N=2 theory at strong coupling. We
also propose a general criterion to distinguish between `physical' and
`unphysical' curvature singularities. Applying it in many backgrounds arising
within the AdS/CFT correspondence we find results that are in complete
agreement with field theory expectations.
