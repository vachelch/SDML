On Some New Black String Solutions in Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive several new solutions in three-dimensional stringy gravity. The
solutions are obtained with the help of string duality transformations. They
represent stationary configurations with horizons, and are surrounded by
(quasi) topologically massive Abelian gauge hair, in addition to the dilaton
and the Kalb-Ramond axion. Our analysis suggests that there exists a more
general family, where our solutions are special limits. Finally, we use the
generating technique recently proposed by Garfinkle to construct a traveling
wave on the extremal variant of one of our solutions.
