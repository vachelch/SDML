BRST Cohomology Ring in ${\hat c_M}<1$ NSR String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The full cohomology ring of the Lian-Zuckerman type operators (states) in
${\hat c_M}<1$ Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond (NSR) string theory is argued to be
generated by three elements $x$, $y$ and $w$ in analogy with the corresponding
results in the bosonic case. The ground ring generators $x$ and $y$ are
non-invertible and belong to the Ramond sector whereas the higher ghost number
operators are generated by an invertible element $w$ with ghost number one less
than that of the ground ring generators and belongs to either Neveu-Schwarz
(NS) or Ramond (R) sector depending on whether we consider (even, even) or
(odd, odd) series coupled to $2d$ supergravity. We explicitly construct these
operators (states) and illustrate our result with an example of pure Liouville
supergravity.
