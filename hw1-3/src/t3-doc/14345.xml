Renormalization-Group Improved Effective Lagrangian for Interacting
  Theories in Curved Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  A method for finding the renormalization group (RG) improved effective
Lagrangian for a massive interacting field theory in curved spacetime is
presented. As a particular example, the $\lambda \varphi^4$-theory is
considered and the RG improved effective Lagrangian is explicitly found up to
second order in the curvature tensors. As a further application, the
curvature-induced phase transitions are discussed for both the massive and the
massless versions of the theory. The problems which appear when calculating the
RG improved effective Lagrangian for gauge theories are discussed, taking as
example the asymptotically free SU(2) gauge model.
