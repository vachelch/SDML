Gauge Symmetry Enhancement and Radiatively Induced Mass in the Large N
  Nonlinear Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a hybrid of nonlinear sigma models in which two complex
projective spaces are coupled with each other under a duality. We study the
large N effective action in 1+1 dimensions. We find that some of the
dynamically generated gauge bosons acquire radiatively induced masses which,
however, vanish along the self-dual points where the two couplings
characterizing each complex projective space coincide. These points correspond
to the target space of the Grassmann manifold along which the gauge symmetry is
enhanced, and the theory favors the non-Abelian ultraviolet fixed point.
