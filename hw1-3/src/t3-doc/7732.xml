<title>
Generalized Gauged Thirring Model on Curved Space-Times
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the interacting theory of charged fermions, scalars,
pseuso-scalars and photons propagating in 2-dimensional curved spacetime in
detail. For certain values of the coupling constants the theory reduces to the
gauged Thirring model and for others the Schwinger model incurved spacetime. It
is shown that the interaction of the fermions with the pseudo-scalars shields
the electromagnetic interaction, and that the non-minimal coupling of the
scalars to the gravitational field amplifies the Hawking radiation. We solve
the finite temperature and density model by using functional techniques and in
particular derive the exact equation of state. The explicit temperature and
curvature dependence of the chiral condensate is found. When the
electromagnetic field is switched off the model reduces to a conformal field
theory. We determine the physically relevant expectation values and conformal
weights of the fundamental fields in the theory.
