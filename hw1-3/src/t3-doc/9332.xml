<title>
Deformation Quantization: Observable Algebras, States and Representation
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In these lecture notes I give an introduction to deformation quantization.
The quantization problem is discussed in some detail thereby motivating the
notion of star products. Starting from a deformed observable algebra, i.e. the
star product algebra, physical applications require to study representations of
this algebra. I review the recent development of a representation theory
including techniques like Rieffel induction and Morita equivalence.
Applications beyond quantization theory are found in noncommutative field
theories.
