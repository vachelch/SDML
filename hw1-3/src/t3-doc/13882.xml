<title>
Topological Theories from Virasoro Constraints on the KP Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  A conformal field theory can be recovered, via the Kontsevich-Miwa transform,
as a solution to the Virasoro constraints on the KP tau function. That theory,
which we call KM CFT, consists of d \leq 1 matter plus a scalar and a dressing
prescription: \Delta = 0 for every primary field. By adding a spin-1 bc system
the KM CFT provides a realization of the N=2 twisted topological algebra. The
other twist of the corresponding untwisted N=2 superconformal theory is a DDK
realization of the N=2 twisted topological algebra. Talk given by Beatriz
Gato-Rivera at the "28th International Symposium on the Theory of Elementary
Particles", Wendisch-Rietz (Germany), August 30 - September 3, 1994.
