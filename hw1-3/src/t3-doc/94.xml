<title>
Topologically Massive Gauge Theory with O(2) Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the structure of the vacua in $O(2)$ topologically massive gauge
theory on a torus. Since $O(2)$ has two connected components, there are four
classical vacua. The different vacua impose different boundary conditions on
the gauge potentials. We also discuss the non-perturbative transitions between
the vacua induced by vortices of the theory.
