PP-wave and Non-supersymmetric Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the pp-wave correspondence to a non supersymmetric example. The
model is the type 0B string theory on the pp-wave R-R background. We explicitly
solve the model and give the spectrum of physical states. The field theory
counterpart is given by a sector of the large N SU(N) x SU(N) CFT living on a
stack of N electric and N magnetic D3-branes. The relevant effective coupling
constant is g_{eff}=g_sN/J^2. The string theory has a tachyon in the spectrum,
whose light-cone energy can be exactly computed as a function of g_{eff}. We
argue that the perturbative analysis in g_{eff} in the dual gauge theory is
reliable, with corrections of non perturbative type. We find a precise
state/operator map, showing that the first perturbative corrections to the
anomalous dimensions of the operators have the behavior expected from the
string analysis.
