Wrapped branes with fluxes in 8d gauged supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the gravity dual of several wrapped D-brane configurations in
presence of 4-form RR fluxes partially piercing the unwrapped directions. We
present a systematic approach to obtain these solutions from those without
fluxes. We use D=8 gauged supergravity as a starting point to build up these
solutions. The configurations include (smeared) M2-branes at the tip of a G_2
cone on S^3 x S^3, D2-D6 branes with the latter wrapping a special Lagrangian
3-cycle of the complex deformed conifold and an holomorphic sphere in its
cotangent bundle T^*S^2, D3-branes at the tip of the generalized resolved
conifold, and others obtained by means of T duality and KK reduction. We
elaborate on the corresponding N=1 and N=2 field theories in 2+1 dimensions.
