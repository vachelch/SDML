<title>
Dimensionally Reduced Chern-Simons Terms and their Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider models in which nonrelativistic matter fields interact with gauge
fields whose dynamics are governed by the Chern-Simons term. The relevant
equations of motion are derived and reduced dimensionally in time or in space.
Interesting solitonic equations emerge and their solutions are described.
Finally, we consider a Chern-Simons term in three-dimensional Euclidean space,
reduced by spherical symmetry, and we discuss its effect on monopole and
instanton solutions.
