<title>
Symmetry Breaking using Fluids II: Velocity Potential Method
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalization of scalar electrodynamics called fluid electrodynamics is
presented. In this theory a fluid replaces the Higgs scalar field. Fluid
electrodynamics might have application to the theory of low temperature Helium
superfluids, but here it is argued that it provides an alternative method of
approaching symmetry breaking in particle physics. The method of constructing
fluid electrodynamics is to start with the velocity decomposition of a perfect
fluid as in general relativity. A unit vector tangent to the flow lines of an
isentropic fluid can be written in terms of scalar potentials:
$V_a=h^{-1}(\ph_a+\al\bt_a-\th S)$. A novel interacting charged fluid can be
obtained by applying the covariant derivative: $D_a=\p_a+ieA_a$ to these scalar
potentials. This fluid is no longer isentropic and there are choices for which
it either obeys the second law of thermodynamics or not. A mass term of the
correct sign occurs for the $A$ term in the stress, and this mass term depends
on the potentials in the above vector. The charged fluid can be reduced to
scalar electrodynamics and the standard approach to symmetry breaking applied;
alternatively a mass can be induced by the fluid by using just the
thermodynamic potentials and then fixing at a critical point, if this is taken
to be the Bose condensation point then the induced mass is negligible.
