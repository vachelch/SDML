<title>
Topological Strings from WZW Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the BRST structure of the topological string is encoded in the
``small'' $N=4$ superconformal algebra, enabling us to obtain, in a non-trivial
way, the string theory from hamiltonian reduction of $A(1|1)$. This leads to
the important conclusion that not only ordinary string theories, but
topological strings as well, can be obtained, or even defined, by hamiltonian
reduction from WZW models. Using two different gradations, we find either the
standard $N=2$ minimal models coupled to topological gravity, or an embedding
of the bosonic string into the topological string. We also comment briefly on
the generalization to super Lie algebras $A(n|n)$.
