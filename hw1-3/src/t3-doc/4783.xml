<title>
A Conformal Field Theory for the Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  The QHE is studied in the context of a CFT. An effective field of $N$
``spins" associated with the cyclotron motion of particles is taken as an order
parameter from which an effective Hamiltonian may be defined. This effective
Hamiltonian describes the COM motion of the $N$ particles (with coupling
$\kappa_0$) together with a current-current interaction (of strength
$\kappa_1$). Such a system gives rise to a CFT in the large $N$ limit when
$\kappa_0 = \kappa_1$. The Laughlin wavefunction is derived from this CFT as an
$N'$-point correlation function of winding state vertex operators.
