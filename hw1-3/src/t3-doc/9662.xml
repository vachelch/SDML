Topology and perturbation theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Paper contains description of the fields nonlinear modes successive
quantization scheme. It is shown that the path integrals for absorption part of
amplitudes are defined on the Dirac ($\d$-like) functional measure. This
permits arbitrary transformation of the functional integral variables. New form
of the perturbation theory achieved by mapping the quantum dynamics in the
space $W_G$ of the ({\it action, angle})-type collective variables. It is shown
that the transformed perturbation theory contributions are accumulated exactly
on the boundary $\pa W_G$. Abilities of the developed formalism are illustrated
by the Coulomb problem. This model is solved in the $W_C$=({\it angle, angular
momentum, Runge-Lentz vector}) space and the reason of its exact integrability
is `emptiness' of $\pa W_C$.
