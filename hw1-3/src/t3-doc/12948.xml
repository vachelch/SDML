Large Marginal Deformations in String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the level truncation scheme to obtain accurate descriptions of open
bosonic string field configurations corresponding to large marginal
deformations such as background Wilson lines. To do so, we solve for all fields
as functions of the massless string field, and confirm that the effective
potential of the massless field becomes increasingly flat as the level of
approximation is increased. Surprisingly, as a result of the merging of two
branches of the solution - one originating at zero tachyon vev and the other
originating at the tachyonic vacuum - this effective potential exists only for
a finite range of values of the massless field. We use the D1 to D0 brane
marginal transition on a circle to explore the possibility that this finite
range corresponds to the infinite range of the conformal field theory parameter
describing marginal deformations, but are unable to arrive at a definitive
conclusion.
