Boundary Fixed Points, Enhanced Gauge Symmetry and Singular Bundles on
  K3
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate certain fixed points in the boundary conformal field theory
representation of type IIA D-branes on Gepner points of K3. They correspond
geometrically to degenerate brane configurations, and physically lead to
enhanced gauge symmetries on the world-volume. Non-abelian gauge groups arise
if the stabilizer group of the fixed points is realized projectively, which is
similar to D-branes on orbifolds with discrete torsion. Moreover, the fixed
point boundary states can be resolved into several irreducible components.
These correspond to bound states at threshold and can be viewed as (non-locally
free) sub-sheaves of semi-stable sheaves. Thus, the BCFT fixed points appear to
carry two-fold geometrical information: on the one hand they probe the boundary
of the instanton moduli space on K3, on the other hand they probe discrete
torsion in D-geometry.
