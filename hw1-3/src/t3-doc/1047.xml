Charge density and electric charge in quantum electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  The convergence of integrals over charge densities is discussed in relation
with the problem of electric charge and (non-local) charged states in Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED). Delicate, but physically relevant, mathematical points
like the domain dependence of local charges as quadratic forms and the time
smearing needed for strong convergence of integrals of charge densities are
analyzed. The results are applied to QED and the choice of time smearing is
shown to be crucial for the removal of vacuum polarization effects responible
for the time dependence of the charge (Swieca phenomenon). The possibility of
constructing physical charged states in the Feynman-Gupta-Bleuler gauge as
limits of local states vectors is discussed, compatibly with the vanishing of
the Gauss charge on local states. A modification by a gauge term of the Dirac
exponential factor which yields the physical Coulomb fields from the
Feynman-Gupta-Bleuler fields is shown to remove the infrared divergence of
scalar products of local and physical charged states, allowing for a
construction of physical charged fields with well defined correlation functions
with local fields.
