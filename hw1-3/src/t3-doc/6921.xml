<title>
Spinning deformations of the D1-D5 system and a geometric resolution of
  Closed Timelike Curves
</title>

<abstract>
  The SO(4) isometry of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole of N=1, D=5
supergravity can be partly broken, without breaking any supersymmetry, in two
different ways. The ``right'' solution is a rotating black hole (BMPV); the
``left'' is interpreted as a black hole in a Godel universe. In ten dimensions,
both spacetimes are described by deformations of the D1-D5-pp-wave system with
the property that the non-trivial Closed Timelike Curves of the five
dimensional manifold are absent in the universal covering space of the ten
dimensional manifold. In the decoupling limit, the BMPV deformation is
normalizable. It corresponds to the vev of an IR relevant operator of dimension
\Delta=1. The Godel deformation is sub-leading in \alpha' unless we take an
infinite vorticity limit; in such case it is a non-normalizable perturbation.
It corresponds to the insertion of a vector operator of dimension \Delta=5.
Thus we conclude that from the dual (1+1)-CFT viewpoint the SO(4) R-symmetry is
broken `spontaneously' in the BMPV case and explicitly in the Godel case.
