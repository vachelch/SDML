An O(N) symmetric extension of the Sine-Gordon Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss an O(N) exension of the Sine-Gordon (S-G)equation which allows us
to perform an expansion around the leading order in large-N result using
Path-Integral methods. In leading order we show our methods agree with the
results of a variational calculation at large-N. We discuss the striking
differences for a non-polynomial interaction between the form for the effective
potential in the Gaussian approximation that one obtains at large-N when
compared to the N=1 case. This is in contrast to the case when the classical
potential is a polynomial in the field and no such drastic differences occur.
We find for our large-N extension of the Sine-Gordon model that the unbroken
ground state is unstable as one increases the coupling constant (as it is for
the original S-G equation) and we determine the stability criteria.
