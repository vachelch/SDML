<title>
New Gauge Invariant Formulation of the Chern-Simons Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A new gauge invariant formulation of the relativistic scalar field
interacting with Chern-Simons gauge fields is considered. This formulation is
consistent with the gauge fixed formulation. Furthermore we find that canonical
(Noether) Poincar\'e generators are not gauge invariant even on the constraints
surface and do not satisfy the (classical) Poincar\'e algebra. It is the
improved generators, constructed from the symmetric energy-momentum tensor,
which are (manifestly) gauge invariant and obey the classical Poincar\'e
algebra.
