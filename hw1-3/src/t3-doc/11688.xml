Lattice Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Hawking process on lattices falling into static black holes. The
motivation is to understand how the outgoing modes and Hawking radiation can
arise in a setting with a strict short distance cutoff in the free-fall frame.
We employ two-dimensional free scalar field theory. For a falling lattice with
a discrete time-translation symmetry we use analytical methods to establish
that, for Killing frequency $\omega$ and surface gravity $\kappa$ satisfying
$\kappa\ll\omega^{1/3}\ll 1$ in lattice units, the continuum Hawking spectrum
is recovered. The low frequency outgoing modes arise from exotic ingoing modes
with large proper wavevectors that "refract" off the horizon. In this model
with time translation symmetry the proper lattice spacing goes to zero at
spatial infinity. We also consider instead falling lattices whose proper
lattice spacing is constant at infinity and therefore grows with time at any
finite radius. This violation of time translation symmetry is visible only at
wavelengths comparable to the lattice spacing, and it is responsible for
transmuting ingoing high Killing frequency modes into low frequency outgoing
modes.
