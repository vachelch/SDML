<title>
Invariance quantum group of the fermionic oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  The fermionic oscillator defined by the algebraic relations cc^*+c^*c=1 and
c^{2}=0 admits the homogeneous group O(2) as its invariance group. We show
that, the structure of the inhomogeneous invariance group of this oscillator is
a quantum group.
