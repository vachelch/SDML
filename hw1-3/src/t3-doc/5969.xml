Alternative N=2 Supergravity in Five Dimensions with Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an alternative N=2 supergravity multiplet coupled to n copies of
vector multiplets and n' copies of hypermultiplets in five dimensions. Our
supergravity multiplet contains a single antisymmetric tensor and a dilaton,
which are natural Neveu-Schwarz massless fields in superstring theory. The
absence of the explicit Chern-Simons terms in our lagrangian deletes the
non-trivial constraints on the couplings of vector multiplets in the
conventional formulation. The scalars in the vector multiplets form the
sigma-model for the coset SO(n,1) / SO(n), like those in the vector multiplets
coupled to N=1 supergravity in nine dimensions, while the scalars in the
hypermultiplets form that for the quaternionic Kahler manifold Sp(n',1) /
Sp(n') X Sp(1). We also perform the gauging of the SO(2) subgroup of the Sp(1)
= SL(2,R) automorphism group of N=2 supersymmetry. Our result is also
generalized to singular 5D space-time as in the conventional formulation, as a
preliminary for supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario.
