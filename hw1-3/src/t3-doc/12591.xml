Open Strings in Exactly Solvable Model of Curved Spacetime and PP-Wave
  Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the superstring version of the exactly solvable string
model constructed by Russo and Tseytlin. This model represents superstring
theory in a curved spacetime and can be seen as a generalization of the Melvin
background. We investigate D-branes in this model as probes of the background
geometry by constructing the boundary states. We find that spacetime
singularities in the model become smooth at high energy from the viewpoint of
open string. We show that there always exist bulk (movable) D-branes by the
effect of electric flux. The model also includes Nappi-Witten model as the
Penrose limit and supersymmetry is enhanced in the limit. We examine this
phenomenon in the open string spectrum. We also find the similar enhancement of
supersymmetry can be occurred in several coset models.
