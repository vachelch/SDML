<title>
Open Wilson Lines and Group Theory of Noncommutative Yang-Mills Theory
  in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The correlation functions of open Wilson line operators in two-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory on the noncommutative torus are computed exactly. The
correlators are expressed in two equivalent forms. An instanton expansion
involves only topological numbers of Heisenberg modules and enables extraction
of the weak-coupling limit of the gauge theory. A dual algebraic expansion
involves only group theoretic quantities, winding numbers and translational
zero modes, and enables analysis of the strong-coupling limit of the gauge
theory and the high-momentum behaviour of open Wilson lines. The dual
expressions can be interpreted physically as exact sums over contributions from
virtual electric dipole quanta.
