<title>
Generalized BF Theory in Superspace as Underlying Theory of 11D
  Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a generalized BF theory in superspace that can embed
eleven-dimensional supergravity theory. Our topological BF theory can
accommodate all the necessary Bianchi identities for teleparallel superspace
supergravity in eleven-dimensions, as the simplest but nontrivial solutions to
superfield equations for our superspace action. This indicates that our theory
may have solutions other than eleven-dimensional supergravity, accommodating
generalized theories of eleven-dimensional supergravity. Therefore our
topological theory can be a good candidate for the low energy limit of
M-theory, as an underlying fundamental theory providing a `missing link'
between eleven-dimensional supergravity and M-theory.
