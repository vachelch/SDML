Solving the Strongly Coupled 2D Gravity: 2. Fractional-Spin Operators,
  and Topological Three-Point Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  Progress along the line of a previous article are reported. One main point is
to include chiral operators with fractional quantum group spins (fourth or
sixth of integers) which are needed to achieve modular invariance. We extend
the study of the chiral bootstrap (recently completed by E. Cremmer, and the
present authors) to the case of semi-infinite quantum-group representations
which correspond to positive integral screening numbers. In particular, we
prove the Bidenharn-Elliot and Racah identities for q-deformed 6-j symbols
generalized to continuous spins. The decoupling of the family of physical
chiral operators (with real conformal weights) at the special values
C_{Liouville}= =7, 13, and 19, is shown to provide a full solution of Moore and
Seiberg's equations, only involving operators with real conformal weights.
Moreover, our study confirms the existence of the strongly coupled topological
models. The three-point functions are shown to be given by a product of leg
factors similar to the ones of the weakly coupled models. However, contrary to
this latter case, the equality between the quantum group spins of the
holomorphic and antiholomorphic components is not preserved by the local vertex
operator. Thus the ``c=1'' barrier appears as connected with a deconfinement of
chirality.
