Little Theories in Six and Seven Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss theories with 16 and 8 supercharges in 6 and 7 dimensions. These
theories are defined as world-volume theories of 5- and 6-branes of type II and
M theories, in the limit in which bulk modes decouple. We analyze in detail the
spectrum of BPS extended objects of these theories, and show that the 6
dimensional ones can be interpreted as little (non-critical) string theories.
The little 5-branes of the 6 dimensional theories with 16 supercharges are used
to find new string theories with 8 supercharges, which have additional group
structure. We describe the web of dualities relating all these theories. We
show that the theories with 16 supercharges can be used for a Matrix
description of M-theory on T^6 in the general case, and that they also
reproduce Matrix theory on T^5 and T^4 in some particular limit.
