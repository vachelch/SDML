Notes on Spinning AdS_3 Black Hole Solution
</title>

<abstract>
  By applying Newman's method, the AdS_3 rotating black hole solution is
"derived" from the nonrotating black hole solution of Banados, Teitelboim and
Zanelli (BTZ). The rotating BTZ solution derived in this fashion is given in
"Boyer-Lindquist-type" coordinates whereas the form of the solution originally
given by BTZ is given in a kind of an "unfamiliar" coordinates which are
related to each other by a transformation of time coordinate alone. The
relative physical meaning between these two coordinates is carefully studied by
evaluating angular momentum per unit mass, angular velocity, surface gravity
and area of the event horizon in two alternative coordinates respectively. The
result of this study leads us to the conclusion that the BTZ time coordinate
must be the time coordinate of an observer who rotates around the axis of the
spinning hole in opposite direction to that of the hole outside its static
limit.
