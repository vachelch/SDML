On Functional Determinants of Laplacians in Polygons and Simplices
</title>

<abstract>
  The functional determinant of an elliptic operator with positive, discrete
spectrum may be defined as $e^{-Z'(0)}$, where $Z(s)$, the zeta function, is
the sum $\sum_n^{\infty} \lambda_n^{-s}$ analytically continued to $s$ around
the origin. In this paper $Z'(0)$ is calculated for the Laplace operator with
Dirichlet boundary conditions inside polygons and simplices with the topology
of a disc in the Euclidean plane. The domains we consider are hence piece--wise
flat with corners on the boundary and in the interior. Our results are
complementary to earlier investigations of the determinants on smooth surfaces
with smooth boundaries. We have explicit closed integrated expressions for
triangles and regular polygons.
