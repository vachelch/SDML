On Penrose limit of elliptic branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a Penrose limit of an elliptic brane configuration with $N_1$ NS5
and $N_2$ D4 branes. This background is T-dual to $N_1$ D3 branes at a fixed
point of a $\mathbf{C}^3/\mathbf{Z}_{N_2}$ singularity and the T-duality
survives the Penrose limit. The triple scaling limit of $N_1$ and $N_2$ gives
rise to IIA pp-wave solution with a space-like compact direction. We identify
the quiver gauge theory operators and argue that upon exchange of the momentum
along the compact direction and the winding number these operators coincide
with the operators derived in the dual type IIB description. We also find a new
Penrose limit of the type IIB background and the corresponding limit in the
type IIA picture. In the coordinate system we use there are two manifest
space-like isometries. The quiver gauge theory operator duals of the string
states are built of three bosonic fields.
