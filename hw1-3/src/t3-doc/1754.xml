<title>
SL(N+1,R) Toda Solitons in Supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct $(D-3)$-brane and instanton solutions using $N \le 10-D$
one-form field strengths in $D$ dimensions, and show that the equations of
motion can be cast into the form of the $SL(N+1,R)$ Toda equations. For generic
values of the charges, the solutions are non-supersymmetric; however, they
reduce to the previously-known multiply-charged supersymmetric solutions when
appropriate charges vanish.
