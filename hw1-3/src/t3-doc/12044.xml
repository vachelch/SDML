Branes Ending On Branes In A Tachyon Model
</title>

<abstract>
  In a tachyon model proposed by Minahan and Zwiebach and derived in the
boundary string field theory, we construct various new solutions which
correspond to nontrivial brane configurations in string theory. Our solutions
include Dp-D(p-2) bound states, (F, Dp) bound states, string junctions,
D(p-2)-branes ending on a Dp-brane, D(p-2)-branes suspended between parallel
Dp-branes and their non-commutative generalizations. We find the Bogomol'nyi
bounds and the BPS equations for some of our solutions, and check the physical
consistency of our solutions with the D-brane picture by looking at the
distributions of their energies and RR-charges in space. We also give
conjectures for a few other brane configurations.
