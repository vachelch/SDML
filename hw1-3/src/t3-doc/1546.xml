Remarks on Finite W Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The property of some finite W algebras to be the commutant of a particular
subalgebra of a simple Lie algebra G is used to construct realizations of G.
When G=so(4,2), unitary representations of the conformal and Poincare algebras
are recognized in this approach, which can be compared to the usual induced
representation technique. When G=sp(2,R) or sp(4,R), the anyonic parameter can
be seen as the eigenvalue of a W generator in such W representations of G. The
generalization of such properties to the affine case is also discussed in the
conclusion, where an alternative of the Wakimoto construction for sl(2) level k
is briefly presented. This mini review is based on invited talks presented by
P. Sorba at the ``Vth International Colloquium on Quantum Groups and Integrable
Systems'', Prague (Czech Republic), June 1996; ``Extended and Quantum Algebras
and their Applications to Physics'', Tianjin (China), August 1996; ``Selected
Topics of Theoretical and Modern Mathematical Physics'', Tbilisi (Georgia),
September 1996; to be published in the Proceedings.
