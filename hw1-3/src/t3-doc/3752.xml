Constant External Fields in Gauge Theory and the Spin 0, 1/2, 1 Path
  Integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the usefulness of the "string-inspired technique" for gauge
theory calculations in a constant external field background. Our approach is
based on Strassler's worldline path integral approach to the Bern-Kosower
formalism, and on the construction of worldline (super--) Green's functions
incorporating external fields as well as internal propagators. The worldline
path integral representation of the gluon loop is reexamined in detail. We
calculate the two-loop effective actions induced for a constant external field
by a scalar and spinor loop, and the corresponding one-loop effective action in
the gluon loop case.
