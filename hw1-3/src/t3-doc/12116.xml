<title>
Quantization of the massless minimally coupled scalar field and the
  dS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the quantization of the massless minimally coupled scalar field
in de Sitter spacetime. The no-boundary Euclidean prescription naturally picks
out the de Sitter invariant vacuum state of Kirsten and Garriga. We extend
Strominger's dS/CFT correspondence to this case which allows us to interpret
the massless field in terms of a Euclidean CFT. The extension is non-trivial
and requires careful treatment of the zero mode. Since the graviton is
massless, this work may also be considered a step towards a theory of gravity
in de Sitter space.
