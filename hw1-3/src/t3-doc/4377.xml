Boundary S-matrix for the Integrable q-Potts Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The 2D off-critical q-state Potts model with boundaries was studied as a
factorizable relativistic scattering theory. The scattering S-matrices for
particles reflecting off the boundaries were obtained for the cases of
``fixed'' and ``free'' boundary conditions. In the Ising limit, the computed
results agreed with recent work[5].
