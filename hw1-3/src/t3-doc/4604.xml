Finite-dimensional Lie algebras of order F
</title>

<abstract>
  $F-$Lie algebras are natural generalisations of Lie algebras (F=1) and Lie
superalgebras (F=2). When $F>2$ not many finite-dimensional examples are known.
In this paper we construct finite-dimensional $F-$Lie algebras $F>2$ by an
inductive process starting from Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras. Matrix
realisations of $F-$Lie algebras constructed in this way from
$\mathfrak{su}(n), \mathfrak{sp}(2n)$ $\mathfrak{so}(n)$ and
$\mathfrak{sl}(n|m)$, $\mathfrak{osp}(2|m)$ are given. We obtain non-trivial
extensions of the Poincar\'e algebra by In\"on\"u-Wigner contraction of certain
$F-$Lie algebras with $F>2$.
