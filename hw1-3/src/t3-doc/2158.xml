BFV-BRST Quantization of the Proca Model based on the Batalin-Tyutin
  formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the Batalin-Tyutin Hamiltonian method to the Abelian Proca model in
order to convert a second class constraint system into a first class one
systematically by introducing the new fields. Then, according to the BFV
formalism we obtain that the desired resulting Lagrangian preserving standard
BRST symmetry naturally includes the well-known St\"ukelberg scalar related to
the explicit gauge-breaking effect due to the presence of the mass term.
Furthermore, we also discuss the nonlocal symmetry structure of this model in
the context of the nonstandard BRST symmetry.
