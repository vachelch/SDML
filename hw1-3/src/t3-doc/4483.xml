The IR/UV Connection in the Non-Commutative Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum field theory on non-commutative spaces does not enjoy the usual
ultraviolet-infrared decoupling that forms the basis for conventional
renormalization. The high momentum contributions to loop integrations can lead
to unfamiliar long distance behavior which can potentially undermine naive
expectations for the IR behavior of the theory. These "anomalies" involve
non-analytic behavior in the noncommutativity parameter Theta making the limit
Theta goes to zero singular.
  In this paper we will analyze such effects in the one loop approximation to
gauge theories on non-commutative space. We will see that contrary to
expectations poles in Theta do occur and lead to large discrepancies between
the expected and actual infrared behavior. We find that poles in Theta are
absent in supersymmetric theories. The "anomalies" are generally still present,
but only at the logarithmic level. A notable exception is non-commutative super
Yang Mills theory with 16 real supercharges in which anomalous effects seem to
be absent altogether.
