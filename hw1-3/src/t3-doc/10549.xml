A Comment on the Zamolodchikov c-Function and the Black String Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the spectral representation approach to the Zamolodchikov's c-function
and the Maldacena conjecture for the D1-branes, we compute the entropy of type
IIB strings. An agreement, up to a numerical constant which cannot be
determined using this approach, with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is found.
