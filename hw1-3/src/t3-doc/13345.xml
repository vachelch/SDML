Supersymmetric Kaluza-Klein reductions of M-waves and MKK-monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the Kaluza-Klein reductions to ten dimensions of the purely
gravitational half-BPS M-theory backgrounds: the M-wave and the Kaluza-Klein
monopole. We determine the moduli space of smooth (supersymmetric) Kaluza-Klein
reductions by classifying the freely-acting spacelike Killing vectors which
preserve some Killing spinor. As a consequence we find a wealth of new
supersymmetric IIA configurations involving composite and/or bound-state
configurations of waves, D0 and D6-branes, Kaluza-Klein monopoles in type IIA
and flux/nullbranes, and some other new configurations. Some new features
raised by the geometry of the Taub-NUT space are discussed, namely the
existence of reductions with no continuous moduli. We also propose an
interpretation of the flux 5-brane in terms of the local description (close to
the branes) of a bound state of D6-branes and ten-dimensional Kaluza-Klein
monopoles.
