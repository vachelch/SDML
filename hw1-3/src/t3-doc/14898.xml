<title>
The Exact Quantum Sine-Gordon Field Equation and Other Non-Perturbative
  Results
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the methods of the "form factor program" exact expressions of all
matrix elements are obtained for several operators of the quantum sine Gordon
model: all powers of the fundamental bose field, general exponentials of it,
the energy momentum tensor and all higher currents. It is found that the
quantum sine-Gordon field equation holds with an exact relation between the
"bare" mass and the renormalized mass. Also a relation for the trace of the
energy momentum is obtained. The eigenvalue problem for all higher conserved
charges is solved. All results are compared with Feynman graph expansions and
full agreement is found.
