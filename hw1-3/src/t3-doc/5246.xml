<title>
deSitter brane universe induced by phantom and quantum effects
</title>

<abstract>
  Five-dimensional braneworld cosmology with deSitter (inflationary) brane
universe induced by classical and quantum matter is discussed. It is shown that
negative energy phantom field with quantum CFT supports the creation of
deSitter universe. On the same time, pure phantom or dust with quantum effects,
or Chaplygin gas with quantum effects may naturally lead to the occurence of
Anti-deSitter brane universe but not deSitter one. It is also interesting that
unlike to four-dimensional gravity, for phantom with (or without) quantum
contribution the standard cosmological energy conditions may be effectively
satisfied.
