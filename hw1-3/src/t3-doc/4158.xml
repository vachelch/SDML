Examples of potentials with convergent Schwinger - DeWitt expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  Convergence of the Schwinger --- DeWitt expansion for the evolution operator
kernel for special class of potentials is studied. It is shown, that this
expansion, which is in general case asymptotic, converges for the potentials
considered (widely used, in particular, in one-dimensional many-body problems),
and besides, convergence takes place only for definite discrete values of the
coupling constant. For other values of the charge divergent expansion
determines the kernels having essential singularity at origin (beyond usual
$\delta$-function). If one consider only this class of potentials then one can
avoid many problems, connected with asymptotic expansions, and one get the
theory with discrete values of the coupling constant that is in correspondence
with discreteness of the charge in the nature. This approach can be transmitted
into the quantum field theory.
