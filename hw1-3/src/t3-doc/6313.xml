<title>
A Superstring Theory in 2+2 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we construct a $(2,2)$ dimensional string theory with manifest
$N=1$ spacetime supersymmetry. We use Berkovits' approach of augmenting the
spacetime supercoordinates by the conjugate momenta for the fermionic
variables. The worldsheet symmetry algebra is a twisted and truncated ``small''
$N=4$ superconformal algebra. The physical spectrum of the open string contains
an infinite number of massless states, including a supermultiplet of a
self-dual Yang-Mills field and a right-handed spinor and a supermultiplet of an
anti-self-dual Yang-Mills field and a left-handed spinor. The higher-spin
multiplets are natural generalisations of these self-dual and anti-self-dual
multiplets.
