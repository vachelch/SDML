Gravitational collapse and its boundary description in AdS
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide examples of gravitational collapse and black hole formation in
AdS, either from collapsing matter shells or in analogy to the
Oppenheimer-Sneider solution. We then investigate boundary properties of the
corresponding states. In particular, we describe the boundary two-point
function corresponding to a shell outside its horizon; if the shell is
quasistatically lowered into the horizon, the resulting state is the Boulware
state. We also describe the more physical Hartle-Hawking state, and discuss its
connection to the quasistatic shell states and to thermalization on the
boundary.
