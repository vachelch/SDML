Superstrings on AdS_5 x S^5 supertwistor space
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the Green-Schwarz action on AdS_5 x S^5 using an alternate version
of the coset superspace construction. By Wick rotations and Lie algebra
identifications we bring the coset to GL(4|4)/(Sp(4) x GL(1))^2, which allows
us to represent the conformal transformations on unconstrained matrices. The
derivation is more streamlined even for the bosonic sector, and conformal
symmetry is manifest at every step. Kappa-symmetry gauge fixing is more
transparent.
