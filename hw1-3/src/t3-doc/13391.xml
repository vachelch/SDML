Actions for Curved Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  The nondeterminantal forms of the Born-Infeld and related brane actions in
which the gauge fields couple to both an induced metric and an intrinsic metric
are generalised by letting either or both metrics be dynamical. The resulting
actions describe ` brane world' and cosmological scenarios in which the gauge
fields are confined to the brane, while gravity propagates in both the
world-volume and the bulk. In particular, for actions involving a nonsymmetric
` metric', nonsymmetric gravity propagates on the worldvolume. For 3-branes
with a symmetric metric, conformal (Weyl) gravity propagates on the worldvolume
and has conformally invariant couplings to the gauge fields.
