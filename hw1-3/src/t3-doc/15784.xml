ORBIFOLDS WITH DISCRETE TORSION AND MIRROR SYMMETRY
</title>

<abstract>
  For a large class of $N=2$ SCFTs, which includes minimal models and many $\s$
models on Calabi-Yau manifolds, the mirror theory can be obtained as an
orbifold. We show that in such a situation the construction of the mirror can
be extended to the presence of discrete torsions. In the case of the
$\ZZ_2\ex\ZZ_2$ torus orbifold, discrete torsion between the two generators
directly provides the mirror model. Working at the Gepner point it is, however,
possible to understand this mirror pair as a special case of the
Berglund--H"ubsch construction. This seems to indicate that the $\ZZ_2\ex\ZZ_2$
example is a mere coincidence, due to special properties of $\ZZ_2$ twists,
rather than a hint at a new mechanism for mirror symmetry.
