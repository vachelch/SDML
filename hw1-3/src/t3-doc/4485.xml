OM Theory and V-duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the (M5, M2, M2$'$, MW) bound state solution of eleven
dimensional supergravity recently constructed in hep-th/0009147 is related to
the (M5, M2) bound state one by a finite Lorentz boost along a M5-brane
direction perpendicular to the M2-brane. Given the (M5, M2) bound state as a
defining system for OM theory and the above relation between this system and
the (M5, M2, M2', MW) bound state, we test the recently proposed V-duality
conjecture in OM theory. Insisting to have a decoupled OM theory, we find that
the allowed Lorentz boost has to be infinitesimally small, therefore resulting
in a family of OM theories related by Galilean boosts. We argue that such
related OM theories are equivalent to each other. In other words, V-duality
holds for OM theory as well. Upon compactification on either an electric or a
`magnetic' circle (plus T-dualities as well), the V-duality for OM theory gives
the known one for either noncommutative open string theories or noncommutative
Yang-Mills theories. This further implies that V-duality holds in general for
the little m-theory without gravity.
