<title>
From the Superparticle Path Integral to Superfield Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the hitherto unexplored relation between the superparticle
path integral and superfield theory. Requiring that the path integral has the
global symmetries of the classical action and obeys the natural composition
property of path integrals, and also that the discretized action has the
correct naive continuum limit, we find a viable discretization of the (D=3,N=2)
free superparticle action. The resulting propagator is not the usual superfield
one. We extend the discretization to include the coupling to an external gauge
supermultiplet and use this to show the equivalence to superfield theory. This
is possible since we are able to reformulate the superfield perturbation theory
in terms of our new propagator.
