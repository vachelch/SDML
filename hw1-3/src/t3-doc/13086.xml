A Conformal Affine Toda Model of 2D Black Holes: A Quantum Study of the
  Evaporation End-Point
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we reformulate the dilaton-gravity theory of Callan \etal\ as a
new effective conformal field theory which turns out to be a generalization of
the so-called $SL_2$-conformal affine Toda (CAT) theory studied some times ago
by Babelon and Bonora. We quantize this model, thus keeping in account the
dilaton-gravity quantum effects. We then implement a Renormalization Group
analysis to study the black hole thermodynamics and the final state of the
Hawking evaporation.
