Sine-Gordon breather form factors and quantum field equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the results of previous investigations on sine-Gordon form factors
exact expressions of all breather matrix elements are obtained for several
operators: all powers of the fundamental bose field, general exponentials of
it, the energy momentum tensor and all higher currents. Formulae for the
asymptotic behavior of bosonic form factors are presented which are motivated
by Weinberg's power counting theorem in perturbation theory. It is found that
the quantum sine-Gordon field equation holds and an exact relation between the
``bare'' mass and the renormalized mass is obtained. Also a quantum version of
a classical relation for the trace of the energy momentum is proven. The
eigenvalue problem for all higher conserved charges is solved. All results are
compared with perturbative Feynman graph expansions and full agreement is
found.
