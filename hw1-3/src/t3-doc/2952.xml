<title>
Formation and Evaporation of a Naked Singularity in 2D Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a classical configuration of conformal matter forming a naked
singularity and discuss its subsequent Hawking evaporation within the context
of two dimensional dilaton gravity. The one loop analysis is credible for a
large mass naked singularity and suggests the existence of a weak cosmological
censorship that would cause it to explode into radiation upon forming.
