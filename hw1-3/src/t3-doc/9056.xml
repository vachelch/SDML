Monopole-Skyrmions
</title>

<abstract>
  A systematic numerical study of the classical solutions to the combined
system consisting of the Georgi-Glashow model and the SO(3) gauged Skyrme model
is presented. The gauging of the Skyrme system permits a lower bound on the
energy, so that the solutions of the composite system can be topologically
stable. The solutions feature some very interesting bifurcation patterns, and
it is found that some branches of these solutions are unstable.
