<title>
The radion and the perturbative metric in RS1
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the linearized metric perturbations in the five dimensional
two-brane model of Randall and Sundrum. In a carefully chosen gauge, we write
down and decouple Einstein equations for the perturbations and get the final
and simple perturbative metric ansatz. This ansatz turns out to be equal to the
linear expansion of the metric solution of Charmousis et al. \cite{rubakov}. We
show that this ansatz, the metric ansatz of Boos et al. \cite{boos} and the one
of Das and Mitov \cite{das} are not incompatible, as it appears on the surface,
but completely equivalent by an allowed gauge transformation that we give.
