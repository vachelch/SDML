Chern-Simons Field Theories in the Coulomb Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk some recent results in the quantization of Chern-Simons field
theories in the Coulomb gauge will be presented. In the first part, the
consistency of the Chern-Simons field theories in this gauge is proven using
the Dirac's canonical formalism for constrained systems. Despite the presence
of non-trivial self-interactions in the gauge fixed functional, it will be
shown that the commutation relations between the fields are trivial at any
perturbative order in the absence of couplings with matter fields. If these
couplings are present, instead, the commutation relations become rather
involved, but it is still possible to study their main properties and to show
that they vanish at the tree level. In the second part of the talk the
perturbative aspects of Chern-Simons field theories in the Coulomb gauge will
be analysed. In particular, it will be shown by explicit computations and in a
regularization independent way that there are no radiative contributions to the
$n-$point correlation functions. Finally the Feynman rules in the Coulomb gauge
will be derived on a three dimensional manifold with a spatial section given by
a closed and orientable Riemann surface.
