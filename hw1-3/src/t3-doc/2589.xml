A Pseudoclassical Model for $P,T-$Invariant Planar Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  A pseudoclassical model is proposed for the description of planar
$P,T-$invariant massive fermions. The quantization of the model leads to the
(2+1)-dimensional $P,T-$invariant fermion model used recently in
$P,T-$conserving theories of high-T${}_c$ superconductors. The rich symmetry of
the quantum model is elucidated through the analysis of the canonical structure
of its pseudoclassical counterpart. We show that both the quantum
$P,T-$invariant planar massive fermion model and the proposed pseudoclassical
model --- for a particular choice of the parameter appearing in the Lagrangian
--- have a U(1,1) dynamical symmetry as well as an $N=3$ supersymmetry. The
hidden supersymmetry leads to a non-standard superextension of the
(2+1)-dimensional Poincar\'e group. In the quantum theory the one particle
states provide an irreducible representation of the extended supergroup
labelled by the zero eigenvalue of the superspin. We discuss the gauge
modification of the pseudoclassical model and compare our results with those
obtained from the standard pseudoclassical model for massive planar fermions.
