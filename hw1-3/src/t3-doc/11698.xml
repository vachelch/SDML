Gravity waves from inflating brane or Mirrors moving in adS$_5$
</title>

<abstract>
  We study tensor perturbations in a model with inflating Randall--Sundrum-type
brane embedded in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (adS$_5$) bulk. In this
model, a natural {\it in}-vacuum of gravitons is the vacuum defined in static
adS$_5$ frame. We show that this vacuum is, in fact, the same as the {\it
in}-vacuum defined in the frame with de Sitter (dS$_4$) slicing, in which the
brane is at rest. Thus, during inflation, gravitons on and off the brane remain
in their vacuum state. We then study graviton creation by the brane on which
inflation terminates at some moment of time. We mostly consider gravitons whose
wavelengths at the end of inflation exceed both the horizon size and the
adS$_5$ radius. Creation of these gravitons is dominated by (zero mode)--(zero
mode) Bogoliubov coefficients and, apart from an overall factor, the spectrum
of produced gravitons is the same as in four-dimensional theory.
``Kaluza--Klein'' gravitons are also produced, but this effect is subdominant.
Graviton spectra at somewhat higher momenta are also presented for
completeness.
