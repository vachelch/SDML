<title>
Geometry of Generalized Coherent States : Some Calculations of Chern
  Characters
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a continuation of the preceding paper (hep-ph/0108219).
  First of all we make a brief review of generalized coherent states based on
Lie algebra su(1,1) and prove that the resolution of unity can be obtained by
the curvature form of some bundle. Next for a set of generalized coherent
states we define a universal bundle over the infinite-dimensional Grassmann
manifold and construct the pull-back bundle making use of a projector from the
parameter space to this Grassmann one. We mainly study Chern characters of
these bundles. Although the Chern characters in the infinite-dimensional case
are in general not easy to calculate, we can perform them for the special
cases. In this paper we report our calculations and propose some problems.
