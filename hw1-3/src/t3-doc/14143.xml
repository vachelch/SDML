Topological Field Theories and Geometry of Batalin-Vilkovisky Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The algebraic and geometric structures of deformations are analyzed
concerning topological field theories of Schwarz type by means of the
Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Deformations of the Chern-Simons-BF theory in
three dimensions induces the Courant algebroid structure on the target space as
a sigma model. Deformations of BF theories in $n$ dimensions are also analyzed.
Two dimensional deformed BF theory induces the Poisson structure and three
dimensional deformed BF theory induces the Courant algebroid structure on the
target space as a sigma model. The deformations of BF theories in $n$
dimensions induce the structures of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras on the target
space.
