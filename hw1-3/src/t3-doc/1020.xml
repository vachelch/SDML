Electromagnetic scattering on D3-brane spikes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider scattering of electromagnetic plane waves on a D3-brane spike
which emanates normal to D3-barne in the extra space direction. We are
interested in studying physical effects on D3-brane which are produced by a
spike attached to D3-brane. We have observed that the spike sucks almost all
electromagnetic radiation and therefore acts like a black hole. This is because
absorption cross section for j=1 tends to a constant at low energy limit. This
behaviour is appealing for a string interpretation of the spike soliton because
the propagation of $j=1$ mode is indeed distinctive. Instead, the scattered
part of the radiation on a D3-brane tends to zero demonstrating non-Thompson
behaviour.
