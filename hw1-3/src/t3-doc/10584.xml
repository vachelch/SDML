<title>
Mass hierarchy and localization of gravity in extra time
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Randall-Sundrum model with localized gravity, replacing the extra
compact space-like dimension by a time-like one. In this way the solution to
the hierarchy problem can be reconciled with a correct cosmological expansion
of the visible universe, just as a trivial result of the sign flip of
cosmological constants in the bulk and on the 3-branes relative to the case of
extra space-like dimension. Some phenomenological aspects of the proposed
scenario related to the tachyonic nature of Kaluza-Klein states of graviton are
also discussed.
