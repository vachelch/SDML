BRST Invariance and Renormalisability of the SU(2)$\times$U(1)
  Electroweak Theory with Massive W Z Bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  Since the SU(n) gauge theory with massive gauge bosons has been proven to be
renormalisable we reinvestigate the renormalisability of the
 SU$_L$(2) $\times$ U$_Y$(1) electroweak theory with massive W Z bosons. We
expound that with the constraint conditions caused by the W Z mass term and the
additional condition chosen by us we can performed the quantization and
construct the ghost action in a way similar to that used for the massive SU(n)
theory. We also show that when the $\delta-$ functions appearing in the path
integral of the Green functions and representing the constraint conditions are
rewritten as Fourier integrals with Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_a$ and
$\lambda_y$, the BRST invariance is kept in the total effective action
consisting of the Lagrange multipliers, ghost fields and the original fields.
Furthermore, by comparing with the massless theory and with the massive SU(n)
theory we find the general form of the divergent part of the generating
functional for the regular vertex functions and prove the renormalisability of
the theory. It is also clarified that the renormalisability of the theory with
the W Z mass term is ensured by that of the massless theory and the massive
SU(n) theory.
