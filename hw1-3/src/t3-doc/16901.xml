World-Volume Interactions on D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine in detail various string scattering amplitudes in order to extract
the world-volume interactions of massless fields on a Dirichlet brane. We find
that the leading low-energy interactions are consistent with the Born-Infeld
and Chern-Simons actions. In particular, our results confirm that the
background closed string fields appearing in these actions must be treated as
functionals of the non-abelian scalar fields describing transverse fluctuations
of the D-brane.
