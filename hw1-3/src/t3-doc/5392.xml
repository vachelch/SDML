Quantum Holonomy in Three-dimensional General Covariant Field Theory and
  Link Invariant
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider quantum holonomy of some three-dimensional general covariant
non-Abelian field theory in Landau gauge and confirm a previous result
partially proven. We show that quantum holonomy retains metric independence
after explicit gauge fixing and hence possesses the topological property of a
link invariant. We examine the generalized quantum holonomy defined on a
multi-component link and discuss its relation to a polynomial for the link.
