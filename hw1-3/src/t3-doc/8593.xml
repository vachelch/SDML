<title>
Canonical Transformations in a Higher-Derivative Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been suggested that the chiral symmetry can be implemented only in
classical Lagrangians containing higher covariant derivatives of odd order.
Contrary to this belief, it is shown that one can construct an exactly soluble
two-dimensional higher-derivative fermionic quantum field theory containing
only derivatives of even order whose classical Lagrangian exhibits chiral-gauge
invariance. The original field solution is expressed in terms of usual Dirac
spinors through a canonical transformation, whose generating function allows
the determination of the new Hamiltonian. It is emphasized that the original
and transformed Hamiltonians are different because the mapping from the old to
the new canonical variables depends explicitly on time. The violation of
cluster decomposition is discussed and the general Wightman functions
satisfying the positive-definiteness condition are obtained.
