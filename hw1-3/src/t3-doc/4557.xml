A Critical Behaviour of Anomalous Currents, Electric-Magnetic
  Universality and CFT_4
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss several aspects of superconformal field theories in four
dimensions (CFT_4), in the context of electric-magnetic duality. We analyse the
behaviour of anomalous currents under RG flow to a conformal fixed point in
N=1, D=4 supersymmetric gauge theories. We prove that the anomalous dimension
of the Konishi current is related to the slope of the beta function at the
critical point. We extend the duality map to the (nonchiral) Konishi current.
As a byproduct we compute the slope of the beta function in the strong coupling
regime. We note that the OPE of $T_{\mu\nu}$ with itself does not close, but
mixes with a special additional operator $\Sigma$ which in general is the
Konishi current. We discuss the implications of this fact in generic
interacting conformal theories. In particular, a SCFT_4 seems to be naturally
equipped with a privileged off-critical deformation $\Sigma$ and this allows us
to argue that electric-magnetic duality can be extended to a neighborhood of
the critical point. We also stress that in SCFT_4 there are two central
charges, c and c', associated with the stress tensor and $\Sigma$,
respectively; c and c' allow us to count both the vector multiplet and the
matter multiplet effective degrees of freedom of the theory.
