<title>
Large-n Limit of N=2 Supersymmetric Q^n Model in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate non-perturbative structures of the two-dimensional N=2
supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model on the quadric surface Q^{n-2}(C) =
SO(n)/SO(n-2)xU(1), which is a Hermitian symmetric space, and therefore Kahler,
by using the auxiliary field and large-n methods. This model contains two kinds
of non-perturbatively stable vacua; one of them is the same vacuum as that of
supersymmetric CP^{n-1} model, and the other is a new kind of vacuum, which has
not yet been known to exist in two-dimensional nonlinear sigma models, the
Higgs phase. We show that both of these vacua are asymptotically free. Although
symmetries are broken in these vacua, there appear no massless Nambu-Goldstone
bosons, in agreement with Coleman's theorem, due to the existence of two
different mechanisms in these vacua, the Schwinger and the Higgs mechanisms.
