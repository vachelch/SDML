Reflection equations and q-Minkowski space algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We express the defining relations of the $q$-deformed Minkowski space algebra
as well as that of the corresponding derivatives and differentials in the form
of reflection equations. This formulation encompasses the covariance properties
with respect the quantum Lorentz group action in a straightforward way.
