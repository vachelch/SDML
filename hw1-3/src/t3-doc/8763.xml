New Vector Field and BRST Charges in 2-form Einstein Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A new vector field is introduced into 2-form Einstein gravity in four
dimensions to restore a large symmetry of its topological version. Two
different expressions for the BRST charge are given in the system: one of them
associated with a set of irreducible symmetries and the other with a set of
on-shell reducible symmetries.
