Roots of Unity: Representations of Quantum Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  Representations of Quantum Groups U_q (g_n), g_n any semi simple Lie algebra
of rank n, are constructed from arbitrary representations of rank n-1 quantum
groups for q a root of unity. Representations which have the maximal dimension
and number of free parameters for irreducible representations arise as special
cases.
