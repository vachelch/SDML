<title>
Nilpotent Marsh and SUSY QM
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the nilpotent additions to classical trajectories in
supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric theories. The condition of anilpotence of
action on some generalized solutions leads to the Witten supersymmetric
Lagrangian. The condition of anilpotence of topological charge is the same as
one of superpotential with spontaneous broken supersymmetry. We should vanish
half of Grassmann constants of integration, because in this case only we obtain
the same number of normalized bosonic and fermionic zero modes.
