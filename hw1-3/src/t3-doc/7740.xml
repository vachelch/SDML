Chiral phase dependence of fermion partition function in two dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  The chiral phase dependence of fermion partition function in spherically
symmetric U(1) gauge field background is analyzed in two dimensional
space-time. A well-defined method to calculated the path integral which apply
to the continuous fermion spectrum is described. The one-to-one correspondence
between the nonzero energy continuous spectra of two pertinent hamiltonians,
which are defined by the Dirac operator to make the path integral well-defined,
is shown to be exact. The asymptotic expansion for the chiral phase dependence
in \(1/|m|^2\) (\(m\) is mass of the fermion.) is proposed and the coefficients
in the expansion are evaluated up to the next-to-next leading term. Up to this
order, the chiral phase dependence is given only by the winding number of
background field and the corrections vanish.
