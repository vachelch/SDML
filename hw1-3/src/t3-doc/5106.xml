<title>
The One Loop Effective Super-Potential and Non-Holomorphicity
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the Kahlerian and the lowest order non-Kahlerian contributions
to the one loop effective superpotential using super-Feynman graphs in the
massless Wess-Zumino Model, the massive Wess-Zumino Model and N=1, U(1) gauge
theory. We also calculate the Kahlerian term in Yang-Mills Theory for a general
gauge group. Using this latter result we find the one loop Kahlerian
contribution for N=2 Yang-Mills Theory in terms of N=1 superfields and we show
that it can only come from non-holomorphic contributions to the N=2 effective
potential.
