Two-Point Green's Function in PT-Symmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian $H={1\over2} p^2+{1\over2}m^2x^2+gx^2(ix)^\delta$ with
$\delta,g\geq0$ is non-Hermitian, but the energy levels are real and positive
as a consequence of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry. The quantum mechanical theory
described by $H$ is treated as a one-dimensional Euclidean quantum field
theory. The two-point Green's function for this theory is investigated using
perturbative and numerical techniques. The K\"allen-Lehmann representation for
the Green's function is constructed, and it is shown that by virtue of ${\cal
PT}$ symmetry the Green's function is entirely real. While the wave-function
renormalization constant $Z$ cannot be interpreted as a conventional
probability, it still obeys a normalization determined by the commutation
relations of the field. This provides strong evidence that the eigenfunctions
of the Hamiltonian are complete.
