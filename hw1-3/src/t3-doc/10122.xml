<title>
Analyzing Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We compare gap equation predictions for the spontaneous breaking of global
symmetries in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to nonperturbative results from
holomorphic effective action techniques. In the theory without matter fields,
both approaches describe the formation of a gluino condensate. With $N_f$
flavors of quark and squark fields, and with $N_f$ below a certain critical
value, the coupled gap equations have a solution for quark and gluino
condensate formation, corresponding to breaking of global symmetries and of
supersymmetry. This appears to disagree with the newer nonperturbative
techniques, but the reliability of gap equations in this context and whether
the solution represents the ground state remain unclear.
