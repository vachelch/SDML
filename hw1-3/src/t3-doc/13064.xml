Black Hole Scan

<abstract>
  Gravitation theories selected by requiring that they have a unique anti-de
Sitter vacuum with a fixed cosmological constant are studied. For a given
dimension d, the Lagrangians under consideration are labeled by an integer
k=1,2,...,[(d-1)/2]. Black holes for each d and k are found and are used to
rank these theories. A minimum possible size for a localized electrically
charged source is predicted in the whole set of theories, except General
Relativity. It is found that the thermodynamic behavior falls into two classes:
If d-2k=1, these solutions resemble the three dimensional black hole,
otherwise, their behavior is similar to the Schwarzschild-AdS_4 geometry.
