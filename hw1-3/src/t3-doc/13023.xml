The Role of Initial Conditions in Presence of Extra Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum field theory in 4+1 dimensional bulk space with boundary,
representing a 3-brane, is considered. We study the impact of the initial
conditions in the bulk on the field dynamics on the brane. We demonstrate that
these conditions determine the Kaluza-Klein measure. We also establish the
existence of a rich family of quantum fields on the brane, generated by the
same bulk action, but corresponding to different initial conditions. A simple
classification of these fields is proposed and it is shown that some of them
lead to ultraviolet finite theories, which have some common features with
strings.
