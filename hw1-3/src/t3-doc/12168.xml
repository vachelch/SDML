<title>
On Mirror Symmetry for Manifolds of Exceptional Holonomy
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Type II string theories on ${\bf T^n}/{{\bf Z_2}^m}$ Joyce
orbifolds. This class contains orbifolds which can be desingularised to give
manifolds of $G_2$ $({\bf n}$$=$$7)$ and $Spin(7)$ holonomy $({\bf n}$$=$$8)$.
In the $G_2$ holonomy case we present two types of $T$-duality transformation
which are clearly generalisations of the $T$-duality/mirror transformation in
Calabi-Yau spaces. The first maps Type IIA theory on one such space from this
class to Type IIB theory on another such space. The second maps Type IIA (IIB)
to Type IIA (IIB). In the case of $Spin(7)$ holonomy we present a $T$-duality
transformation which maps Type IIA (IIB) theory on one such space to Type IIA
(IIB) on another such space. As orbifold conformal field theories these
$T$-dual target spaces are related via the inclusion/exclusion of discrete
torsion and the $T$-duality is proven to genus $g$ in string perturbation
theory. We then apply a Strominger, Yau, Zaslow type argument which suggests
that manifolds of $G_2$ holonomy which have a ``mirror'' of the first (second)
type admit supersymmetric ${\bf T^3}$ (${\bf T^4}$) fibrations and that
manifolds of $Spin(7)$ holonomy for which a mirror exists admit fibration by
supersymmetric $4$-tori. Further evidence for this suggestion is given by
examining the moduli space structure of wrapped D-branes.
