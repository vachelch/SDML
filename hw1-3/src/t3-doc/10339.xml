Topological defects as inhomogeneous condensates in Quantum Field
  Theory: Kinks in (1+1) dimensional $\la \psi^4$ theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study topological defects as inhomogeneous (localized) condensates of
particles in Quantum Field Theory. In the framework of the Closed-Time-Path
formalism, we consider explicitly a $(1+1)$ dimensional $\la \psi^4$ model and
construct the Heisenberg picture field operator $\psi$ in the presence of
kinks. We show how the classical kink solutions emerge from the vacuum
expectation value of such an operator in the Born approximation and/or $\la \to
0$ limit. The presented method is general in the sense that applies also to the
case of finite temperature and to non-equilibrium; it also allows for the
determination of Green's functions in the presence of topological defects. We
discuss the classical kink solutions at $T\neq 0$ in the high temperature
limit. We conclude with some speculations on the possible relevance of our
method for the description of the defect formation during symmetry-breaking
phase transitions.
