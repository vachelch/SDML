BATALIN-FRADKIN-TYUTIN EMBEDDING OF A SELF-DUAL MODEL AND THE
  MAXWELL-CHERN-SIMONS THEORY
</title>

<abstract>
  We convert the self-dual model of Townsend, Pilch, and Nieuwenhuizen to a
first-class system using the generalized canonical formalism of Batalin,
Fradkin, and Tyutin and show that gauge-invariant fields in the embedded model
can be identified with observables in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory as well
as with the fundamental fields of the self-dual model. We construct the
phase-space partition function of the embedded model and demonstrate how a
basic set of gauge-variant fields can play the role of either the vector
potentials in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory or the fundamental fields of the
self-dual model by appropriate choices of gauge.
