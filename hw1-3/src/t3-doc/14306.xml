<title>
Metric of the multiply wound rotating string
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a string wrapped many times around a compact circle in space, and
let this string carry a right moving wave which imparts momentum and angular
momentum to the string. The angular momentum causes the strands of the
`multiwound' string to separate and cover the surface of a torus. We compute
the supergravity solution for this string configuration. We map this solution
by dualities to the D1-D5 system with angular momentum that has been recently
studied. We discuss how constructing this multiwound string solution may help
us to relate the microscopic and macroscopic pictures of black hole absorption.
