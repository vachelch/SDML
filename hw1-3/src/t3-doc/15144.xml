Universal Dynamics, a Unified Theory of Complex Systems. Emergence, Life
  and Death
</title>

<abstract>
  A universal framework is proposed, where all laws are regularities of
relations between things or agents. Parts of the world at one or all times are
modeled as networks called SYSTEMS with a minimum of axiomatic properties. A
notion of locality is introduced by declaring some relations direct (or links).
Dynamics is composed of "atomic" constituents called mechanisms. They are
conditional actions of basic local structural transformations (``enzymes''):
indirect relations become direct (friend of friend becomes friend), links are
removed, objects copied. This defines a kind of universal chemistry.
  I show how to model basic life processes in a self contained fashion as a
kind of enzymatic computation. The framework also accommodates the gauge
theories of fundamental physics. Emergence creates new functionality by
cooperation - nonlocal phenomena arise out of local interactions. I explain how
this can be understood in a reductionist way by multiscale analysis (e.g.
renormalization group).
