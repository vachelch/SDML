Harmonic-Superspace Transform For N=3 SYM-Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The SU(3)/U(1) x U(1) harmonic variables are used in the harmonic-superspace
representation of the D=4, N=3 SYM-equations. The harmonic superfield equations
of motion in the simple non-covariant gauge contain the nilpotent harmonic
analytic connections. It is shown that these harmonic SYM-equations are
equivalent to the finite set of solvable linear iterative equations.
