Universality for SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory in (2+1)D
</title>

<abstract>
  The Green's Function Monte Carlo method of Chin et al is applied to SU(2)
Yang-Mills theory in (2+1)D. Accurate measurements are obtained for the
ground-state energy and mean plaquette value, and for various Wilson loops. The
results are compared with series expansions and coupled cluster estimates, and
with the Euclidean Monte Carlo results of Teper. A striking demonstration of
universality between the Hamiltonian and Euclidean formulations is obtained.
