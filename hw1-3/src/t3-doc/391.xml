Generic junction conditions in brane-world scenarios
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the generic junction conditions obeyed by a co-dimension one brane
in an arbitrary background spacetime. As well as the usual Darmois-Israel
junction conditions which relate the discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature
to the to the energy-momentum tensor of matter which is localized to the brane,
we point out that another condition must also be obeyed. This condition, which
is the analogous to Newton's second law for a point particle, is trivially
satisfied when $Z_2$ symmetry is enforced by hand, but in more general
circumstances governs the evolution of the brane world-volume. As an
illustration of its effect we compute the force on the brane due to a form
field.
