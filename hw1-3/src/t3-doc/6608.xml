<title>
New Fundamental Symmetries of Integrable Systems and Partial Bethe
  Ansatz
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a new concept of quasi-Yang-Baxter algebras. The quantum
quasi-Yang-Baxter algebras being simple but non-trivial deformations of
ordinary algebras of monodromy matrices realize a new type of quantum dynamical
symmetries and find an unexpected and remarkable applications in quantum
inverse scattering method (QISM). We show that applying to quasi-Yang-Baxter
algebras the standard procedure of QISM one obtains new wide classes of quantum
models which, being integrable (i.e. having enough number of commuting
integrals of motion) are only quasi-exactly solvable (i.e. admit an algebraic
Bethe ansatz solution for arbitrarily large but limited parts of the spectrum).
These quasi-exactly solvable models naturally arise as deformations of known
exactly solvable ones. A general theory of such deformations is proposed. The
correspondence ``Yangian --- quasi-Yangian'' and ``$XXX$ spin models ---
quasi-$XXX$ spin models'' is discussed in detail. We also construct the
classical conterparts of quasi-Yang-Baxter algebras and show that they
naturally lead to new classes of classical integrable models. We conjecture
that these models are quasi-exactly solvable in the sense of classical inverse
scattering method, i.e. admit only partial construction of action-angle
variables.
