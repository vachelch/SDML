Conformal p-branes as a Source of Structure in Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
We discuss a model of a conformal p-brane interacting with the world volume
metric and connection. The purpose of the model is to suggest a mechanism by
which gravity coupled to p-branes leads to the formation of structure rather
than homogeneity in spacetime. Furthermore, we show that the formation of
structure is accompanied by the appearance of a multivalued cosmological
constant, i.e., one which may take on different values in different domains, or
cells, of spacetime. The above results apply to a broad class of non linear
gravitational lagrangians as long as metric and connection on the p-brane
manifold are treated as independent variables.
