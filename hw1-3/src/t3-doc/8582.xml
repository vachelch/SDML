Absorption of fixed scalar in scattering off 4D N=4 black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform the perturbation analysis of the black holes in the 4D, N=4
supergravity. Analysis around the black holes reveals a complicated mixing
between the dilaton and other fields (metric and two U(1) Maxwell fields). It
turns out that considering both s-wave (l=0) and higher momentum modes (l \neq
0), the dilaton as a fixed scalar is the only propagating mode with $P=Q,
h_1=h_2=0$ and $F = -G = 2\phi$. We calculate the absorption cross-section for
scattering of low frequency waves of fixed scalar and U(1) Maxwell fields off
the extremal black hole.
