Vortices, flux tubes and other structures in the Ginzburg-Landau model:
  a possible fine structure of the mixed state?
</title>

<abstract>
  We present new regular static isolated cylindrically symmetric solutions for
the Ginzburg-Landau model which have finite Gibbs free energy. These
configurations (which we call the {\it flux tube} and {\it type B} solutions)
are energetically favorable in the interval of the external magnetic fields
between the thermodynamic critical value $H_{c}$ and the upper critical field
$H_{c_2}$ which indicates that they are important new elements of the mixed
state describing a transition from vortices to the normal state.
