Trapped States and bound states of a soliton in a well
</title>

<abstract>
  The nature of the interaction of a soliton with an attractive well is
elucidated using a model of two interacting point particles. The model explains
the existence of trapped states at positive kinetic energy, as well as
reflection by an attractive impurity. The transition from a trapped soliton
state to a bound state is studied. Bound states of the soliton in a well are
also found.
