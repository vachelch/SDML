Phase Space Reduction and Vortex Statistics: An Anyon Quantization
  Ambiguity
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the quantization of the motion of two charged vortices in a
Ginzburg--Landau theory for the fractional quantum Hall effect recently
proposed by the first two authors. The system has two second-class constraints
which can be implemented either in the reduced phase space or
Dirac-Gupta-Bleuler formalism. Using the intrinsic formulation of statistics,
we show that these two ways of implementing the constraints are inequivalent
unless the vortices are quantized with conventional statistics; either
fermionic or bosonic.
