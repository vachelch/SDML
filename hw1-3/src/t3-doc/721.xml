A generalization of the Jordan-Schwinger map: classical version and its
  q--deformation
</title>

<abstract>
  For all three--dimensional Lie algebras the construction of generators in
terms of functions on 4-dimensional real phase space is given with a
realization of the Lie product in terms of Poisson brackets. This is the
classical Jordan--Schwinger map which is also given for the deformed algebras
${\cal {SL}}_{q}(2,\R)$, ${\cal E}_{q} (2)$ and ${\cal H}_q(1)$. The ${\cal
U}_{q}(n)$ algebra is discussed in the same context.
