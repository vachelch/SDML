Moduli Space and Scattering of D0-Branes in Noncommutative Super
  Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the moduli space of the D0-brane system on Dp-branes realized in the
noncommutative super Yang-Mills theory. By examining the fluctuations around
the solitonic solutions generated by solution generating technique, we confirm
the interpretation of the moduli as the positions of D0-branes on Dp-branes.
Low-energy scattering process is also examined for two D0-branes. We find that
the D0-branes scatter at right angle for head-on collision in the D0-D4 system.
For D0-D6 and D0-D8 systems we find special solutions which reduce to the D0-D4
case, giving the same behavior. This suggests that the scattering at right
angle for head-on collision is a universal behavior of this kind of soliton
scatterings.
