Non-holomorphic terms in N=2 SUSY Wilsonian actions and RG equation
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we first investigate the Ansatz of one of the present authors
for K(\Psi,\bar\Psi), the adimensional modular invariant non-holomorphic
correction to the Wilsonian effective Lagrangian of an N=2 globally
supersymmetric gauge theory. The renormalisation group beta-function of the
theory crucially allows us to express K(\Psi,\bar\Psi) in a form that easily
generalises to the case in which the theory is coupled to N_F hypermultiplets
in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. This function satisfies
an equation which should be viewed as a fully non-perturbative ``non-chiral
superconformal Ward identity". We also determine its renormalisation group
equation. Furthermore, as a first step towards checking the validity of this
Ansatz, we compute the contribution to K(\Psi,\bar\Psi) from instantons of
winding number k=1 and k=2. As a by-product of our analysis we check a
non-renormalisation theorem for N_F=4.
