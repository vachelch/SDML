<title>
Superconformal Field Theories, Multiplet Shortening, and the
  AdS$_5$/SCFT$_4$ Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the unitarity bounds and the multiplet shortening of UIR's of 4
dimensional superconformal algebras $SU(2,2|N)$, ($N=1,2,4$) in view of their
dual role in the AdS/SCFT correspondence. Some applications to KK spectra,
non-perturbative states and stringy states are given.
