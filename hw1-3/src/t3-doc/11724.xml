Interactions of Massive Integer-Spin Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the interactions of massive fields of arbitrary integer spins with
the constant electromagnetic field and symmetrical Einstein space in the gauge
invariant framework. The problem of obtaining the gauge-invariant Lagrangians
of integer spin fields in an external field is reduced to purely algebraic
problem of finding a set of operators with certain features using the
representation of the higher-spin fields in the form of vectors in a
pseudo-Hilbert space. Such a construction is considered up to the second order
for the electromagnetic field and at linear approximation for symmetrical
Einstein space. The results obtained are valid for space-time of arbitrary
dimensionality.
