<title>
Spontaneous Compactification to Robertson-Walker Universe Due To
  Dynamical Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate multidimensional gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet term and with
torsion on the space of extra dimensions chosen to be the group manifold of a
simple Lie group. We take the Robertson-Walker ansatz for the 4-dimensional
space-time and study the potential of a dilaton and torsion fields. It is shown
that for certain values of the parameters of the initial theory the potential
has classically stable minima, corresponding to the spontaneous
compactification of the extra dimensions. However, these minima have zero
torsion.
