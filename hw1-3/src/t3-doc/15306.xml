<title>
Generalized Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and Reflectionless Fermion
  Bags in 1+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study static fermion bags in the 1+1 dimensional Gross-Neveu and
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models. It has been known, from the work of Dashen,
Hasslacher and Neveu (DHN), followed by Shei's work, in the 1970's, that the
self-consistent static fermion bags in these models are reflectionless. The
works of DHN and of Shei were based on inverse scattering theory. Several years
ago, we offered an alternative argument to establish the reflectionless nature
of these fermion bags, which was based on analysis of the spatial asymptotic
behavior of the resolvent of the Dirac operator in the background of a static
bag, subjected to the appropriate boundary conditions. We also calculated the
masses of fermion bags based on the resolvent and the Gelfand-Dikii identity.
Based on arguments taken from a certain generalized one dimensional
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which underlies the spectral theory of these
Dirac operators, we now realize that our analysis of the asymptotic behavior of
the resolvent was incomplete. We offer here a critique of our asymptotic
argument.
