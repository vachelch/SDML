<title>
Drinfel'd algebra deformations and the associahedra
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a cohomology theory controlling the deformations of a general
Drinfel'd algebra. The picture presented here has two sides -- the
combinatorial one related with the fact of the existence of a graded Lie
algebra structure on the simplicial cochain complex of the associahedra, and
the algebraic one related with the algebra of derivations on the bar
construction.
