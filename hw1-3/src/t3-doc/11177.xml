<title>
On the equivalence of bound state solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we show the equivalence of various (non-threshold) bound state
solutions of branes, or equivalently branes in background potentials, in ten-
and eleven-dimensional supergravity. We compare solutions obtained in two very
different ways. One method uses a zero mode analysis to make an Ansatz which
makes it possible to solve the full non-linear supergravity equations. The
other method utilises T-duality techniques to turn on the fields on the brane.
To be specific, in eleven dimensions we show the equivalence for the (M2,M5)
bound state, or equivalently an M5-brane in a C_3 field, where we also consider
the (MW,M2,M2',M5) solution, which can be obtained from the (M2,M5) bound state
by a boost. In ten dimensions we show the equivalence for the ((F,D1),D3) bound
state as well as the bound states of (p,q) 5-branes with lower dimensional
branes in type IIB, corresponding to D3-branes in B_2 and C_2 fields and (p,q)
5-branes in B_2, C_2 and C_4 fields. We also comment on the recently proposed
V-duality related to infinitesimally boosted solutions.
