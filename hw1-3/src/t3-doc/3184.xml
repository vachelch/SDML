Anti-de Sitter space and black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Anti-de Sitter space with identified points give rise to black-hole
structures. This was first pointed out in three dimensions, and generalized to
higher dimensions by Aminneborg et al. In this paper, we analyse several
aspects of the five dimensional anti-de Sitter black hole including, its
relation to thermal anti-de Sitter space, its embedding in a Chern-Simons
supergravity theory, its global charges and holonomies, and the existence of
Killing spinors.
