<title>
On $\widehat{sl}(3)$ reduction, quantum gauge transformations, and
  ${\cal W}-$ algebras singular vectors
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of describing the singular vectors of $\cW_3$ and $\cW_3^{(2)}$
Verma modules is addressed, viewing these algebras as BRST quantized
Drinfeld-Sokolov (DS) reductions of $A^{(1)}_2\,$. Singular vectors of an
$A^{(1)}_2\,$ Verma module are mapped into $\W$ algebra singular vectors and
are shown to differ from the latter by terms trivial in the BRST cohomology.
These maps are realized by quantum versions of the highest weight DS gauge
transformations.
