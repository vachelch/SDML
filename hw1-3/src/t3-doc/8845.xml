On-brane data for braneworld stars
</title>

<abstract>
  Stellar structure in braneworlds is markedly different from that in ordinary
general relativity. As an indispensable first step towards a more general
analysis, we completely solve the ``on brane'' 4-dimensional Gauss and Codazzi
equations for an arbitrary static spherically symmetric star in a
Randall--Sundrum type II braneworld. We then indicate how this on-brane
boundary data should be propagated into the bulk in order to determine the full
5-dimensional spacetime geometry. Finally, we demonstrate how this procedure
can be generalized to solid objects such as planets.
