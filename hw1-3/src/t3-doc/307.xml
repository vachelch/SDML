<title>
The effective potential of composite fields in weakly coupled QED in a
  uniform external magnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective potential for the composite fields responsible for chiral
symmetry breaking in weakly coupled QED in a magnetic field is derived. The
global minimum of the effective potential is found to acquire a non-vanishing
expectation value of the composite fields that leads to generating the
dynamical fermion mass by an external magnetic field. The results are compared
with those for the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.
