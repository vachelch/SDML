Global Monopole in Asymptotically dS/AdS Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we investigate the global monopole in asymptotically dS/Ads
spacetime and find that the mass of the monopole in the asymptotically dS
spacetime could be positive if the cosmological constant is greater than a
critical value. This shows that the gravitational field of the global monopole
could be attractive or repulsive depending on the value of the cosmological
constant.
