<title>
Thermodynamics of Black Holes in Presence of String Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  The coupling of a Nambu-Goto string to gravity allows for Schwarzschild black
holes whose entropy to area relation is $S=(A/4)(1-4\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the
string tension. The departure from $A/4$ universality results from a string
instanton which leads to a materialisation of the horizon at the quantum level.
