Gauge Theory on a Quantum Phase Space
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we present a operator formulation of gauge theories in a quantum
phase space which is specified by a operator algebra. For simplicity we work
with the Heisenberg algebra. We introduce the notion of the derivative
(transport) and Wilson line (parallel transport) which enables us to construct
a gauge theory in a simple way. We illustrate the formulation by a discussion
of the Higgs mechanism and comment on the large N masterfield.
