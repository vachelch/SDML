<title>
A continuum string model for $D>1$
</title>

<abstract>
  The non critical string (2D gravity coupled to the matter with central charge
$D$) is quantized taking care of both diffeomorphism and Weyl symmetries. In
incorporating the gauge fixing with respect to the Weyl symmetry, through the
condition $R_g=const$, one modifies the classical result of Distler and Kawai.
In particular one obtains the real string tension for an arbitrary value of
central charge $D$.
