Brane World
</title>

<abstract>
  In string theory, the brane world scenario, where the Standard Model gauge
and matter fields live inside some branes while gravitons live in the bulk, can
be a viable description of our universe. In this note we argue that the brane
world actually is a likely description of nature. Our discussion includes a
revisit of certain issues, namely, coupling unification, dilaton stabilization
and supersymmetry breaking, in the context of the brane world scenario. In
particular, we discuss various possible string scenarios and their
phenomenological implications in the brane world framework.
