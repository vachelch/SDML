Finite Dimensional Representations of the Quantum Superalgebra
  $U_q[gl(3/2)]$ in a Reduced $U_q[gl(3/2)] \supset U_q[gl(3/1)] \supset
  U_q[gl(3)]$ Basis
</title>

<abstract>
  For generic $q$ we give expressions for the transformations of all
essentially typical finite-dimensional modules of the Hopf superalgebra
$U_q[gl(3/2)]$. The latter is a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra
of the Lie superalgebra $gl(3/2)$. The basis within each module is similar to
the Gel'fand-Zetlin basis for $gl(5)$. We write down expressions for the
transformations of the basis under the action of the Chevalley generators.
