Interacting mixed-symmetry type tensor gauge fields of degrees two and
  three: a four-dimensional cohomological approach
</title>

<abstract>
  A special class of mixed-symmetry type tensor gauge fields of degrees two and
three in four dimensions is investigated from the perspective of the Lagrangian
deformation procedure based on cohomological BRST techniques. It is shown that
the deformed solution to the master equation can be taken to be nonvanishing
only at the first order in the coupling constant. As a consequence, we deduce
an interacting model with deformed gauge transformations, an open gauge algebra
and undeformed reducibility functions. The resulting coupled Lagrangian action
contains a quartic vertex and some ``mass'' terms involving only the tensor of
degree two. We discuss in what sense the results of the deformation procedure
derived here are complementary to recent others.
