Kink States in $P(\phi)_2$-Models (An Algebraic Approach)
</title>

<abstract>
  Several two-dimensional quantum field theory models have more than one vacuum
state. Familiar examples are the Sine-Gordon and the $\phi^4_2$-model. It is
known that these models possess states, called kink states, which interpolate
different vacua. A general construction scheme for kink states in the framework
of algebraic quantum field theory is developed in a previous paper. However,
for the application of this method, the crucial condition is the split property
for wedge algebras in the vacuum representations of the considered models. It
is believed that the vacuum representations of $P(\phi)_2$-models fulfill this
condition, but a rigorous proof is only known for the massive free scalar
field. Therefore, we investigate in a construction of kink states which can
directly be applied to $P(\phi)_2$-model, by making use of the properties of
the dynamic of a $P(\phi)_2$-model.
