A Note on Representations of N=2 SW-Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the representation theory of some recently constructed N=2
super W-algebras with two generators. Except for the central charges in the
unitary minimal series of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra we find no new
rational models. However, from our results it is possible to arrange all known
N=2 super W-algebras with two generators and vanishing self-coupling constant
into four classes. For the algebras existing for c >= 3 which can be understood
by the spectral flow of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra we find that the
representations have quantized U(1) charge.
