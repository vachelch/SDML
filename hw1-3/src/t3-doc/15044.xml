<title>
Lattice Gauge Theories with polynomial Action and their canonical
  Formulation on the Light Front
</title>

<abstract>
  A lattice gauge theory with an action polynomial in independent field
variables is considered. The link variables are described by unconstrained
complex matrices instead of unitary ones. A mechanism which permits to switch
off in the continuous limit the arising extra fields is discussed. The
Euclidean version of the theory with an 4-dimensional lattice is described. The
canonical form of this theory in Lorentz coordinates with continuous time is
given. The canonical formulation in the light-front coordinates is investigated
for the lattice in 2-dimensional transverse space and for the 3-dimensional
lattice including one of the light-like coordinates. The light-front zero mode
problem is considered in the framework of this canonical formulation.
