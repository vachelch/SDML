<title>
Non-holomorphic effective potential in N = 4 SU(n) SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the one-loop non-holomorphic effective potential for the N=4 SU(n)
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the gauge symmetry broken down to the
maximal torus. Our approach remains powerful for arbitrary gauge groups and is
based on the use of N=2 harmonic superspace formulation for general N=2
Yang-Mills theories along with the superfield background field method.
