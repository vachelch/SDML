<title>
Integrable Chain Model with Additional Staggered Model Parameter
</title>

<abstract>
  The generalization of the Yang-Baxter equations (YBE) in the presence of Z_2
grading along both chain and time directions is presented. The XXZ model with
staggered disposition along a chain of both, the anisotropy \pm\Delta, as well
as shifts of the spectral parameters are considered and the corresponding
integrable model is constructed. The Hamiltonian of the model is computed in
fermionic and spin formulations. It involves three neighbour site interactions
and therefore can be considered as a zig-zag ladder model. The Algebraic Bethe
Ansatz technique is applied and the eigenstates, along with eigenvalues of the
transfer matrix of the model are found. The model has a free fermionic limit at
\Delta=0 and the integrable boundary terms are found in this case.
  This construction is quite general and can be applied to other known
integrable models.
