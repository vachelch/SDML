Threshold Corrections and Gauge Symmetry in Twisted Superstring Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Threshold corrections to the running of gauge couplings are calculated for
superstring models with free complex world sheet fermions. For two N=1
$SU(2)\times U(1)^5$ models, the threshold corrections lead to a small increase
in the unification scale. Examples are given to illustrate how a given particle
spectrum can be described by models with different boundary conditions on the
internal fermions. We also discuss how complex twisted fermions can enhance the
symmetry group of an N=4 $SU(3)\times U(1)\times U(1)$ model to the gauge group
$SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. It is then shown how a mixing angle analogous
to the Weinberg angle depends on the boundary conditions of the internal
fermions.
