M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an eleven-dimensional superspace with superspace coordinates and
formulate a finite M-theory using non-anticommutative geometry. The conjectured
M-theory has the correct eleven-dimensional supergravity low energy limit. We
consider the problem of finding a stable finite M-theory which has de Sitter
space as a natural ground state, and the problem of eliminating possible future
horizons.
