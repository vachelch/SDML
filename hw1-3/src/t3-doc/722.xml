<title>
On Matrix Strings, the Large N Limit and Discretized Light-Cone
  Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the 1+1 dimensional supersymmetric matrix field theory obtained
from a dimensional reduction of ten dimensional ${\cal N} = 1$ super
Yang-Mills, which is a matrix model candidate for non-perturbative Type IIA
string theory. The gauge group here is U($N$), where $N$ is sent to infinity.
We adopt light-cone coordinates to parametrize the string world sheet, and
choose to work in the light-cone gauge. Quantizing this theory via Discretized
Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) introduces an integer, K, which restricts the
light-cone momentum-fraction of constituent quanta to be integer multiples of
1/K. We show how a double scaling limit involving the integers $K$ and $N$
implies the existence of an extra (free) parameter in the Yang-Mills theory,
which plays the role of an effective string coupling constant. The formulation
here provides a natural framework for studying quantitatively string dynamics
and conventional Yang-Mills in a unified setting.
