<title>
Massless quantum electrodynamics with a critical point
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, it has been observed that a quantum field theory need not be
Hermitian to have a real, positive spectrum. What seems to be required is
symmetry under combined parity and time-reversal transformations. This idea is
extended to massless electrodynamics, in which the photon couples to the
axial-vector current with an imaginary coupling constant. The eigenvalue
condition necessary for the finiteness of the theory can now be solved; the
value for the charge appears to be stable order-by-order. Similarly, the
semiclassical Casimir model for the fine-structure constant yields a positive
value.
