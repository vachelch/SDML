Spacetime Variable Superstring Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  In a general superstring vacuum configuration, the `internal' space (sector)
varies in spacetime. When this variation is non-trivial only in two space-like
dimensions, the vacuum contains static cosmic strings with finite energy per
unit length and which is, up to interactions with matter, an easily computed
topological invariant. The total spacetime is smooth although the `internal'
space is singular at the center of each cosmic string. In a similar analysis of
the Wick-rotated Euclidean model, these cosmic strings acquire expected
self-interactions. Also, a possibility emerges to define a global time in order
to rotate back to the Lorentzian case.
