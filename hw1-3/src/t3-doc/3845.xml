Non-Extreme Black Holes from Intersecting M-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the possibility of extending non-extreme black hole solutions
made of intersecting M-branes to those with two non-extreme deformation
parameters, similar to Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m solutions. General analysis of
possible solutions is carried out to reduce the problem of solving field
equations to a simple algebraic one for static spherically-symmetric case in
$D$ dimensions. The results are used to show that the extension to
two-parameter solutions is possible for $D=4,5$ dimensions but not for higher
dimensions, and that the area of horizon always vanishes in the extreme limit
for black hole solutions for $D \geq 6$ except for two very special cases which
are identified. Various solutions are also summarized.
