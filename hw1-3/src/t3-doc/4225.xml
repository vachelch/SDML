<title>
The Sugawara generators at arbitrary level
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an explicit representation of the Sugawara generators for
arbitrary level in terms of the homogeneous Heisenberg subalgebra, which
generalizes the well-known expression at level 1. This is achieved by employing
a physical vertex operator realization of the affine algebra at arbitrary
level, in contrast to the Frenkel--Kac--Segal construction which uses
unphysical oscillators and is restricted to level 1. At higher level, the new
operators are transcendental functions of DDF ``oscillators'' unlike the
quadratic expressions for the level-1 generators. An essential new feature of
our construction is the appearance, beyond level 1, of new types of poles in
the operator product expansions in addition to the ones at coincident points,
which entail (controllable) non-localities in our formulas. We demonstrate the
utility of the new formalism by explicitly working out some higher-level
examples. Our results have important implications for the problem of
constructing explicit representations for higher-level root spaces of
hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebras, and $E_{10}$ in particular.
