Remarks on the Heavy Quark Potential in the Supergravity Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out certain unexpected features of the planar QCD3 confining
potential, as computed from a classical worldsheet action in an AdS metric via
the Maldacena conjecture. We show that there is no Luscher c/R term in the
static-quark potential, which is contrary to both the prediction of various
effective string models, and the results of some recent lattice Monte Carlo
studies. It is also noted that the glueball masses extracted from classical
supergravity tend to finite, coupling-independent constants in the strong
coupling limit, even as the string tension tends to infinity in the same limit;
this is a counter-intuitive result.
