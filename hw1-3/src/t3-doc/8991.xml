<title>
Entangled Simultaneous Measurement and Elementary Particle
  Representations
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose that the principles of relativistic quantum mechanics are
incomplete for simultaneous measurement of non-commuting operators. Consistent
joint measurement of incompatible observables at a single point in space-time
requires that the system be in an entangled state with vacuum meters. We
suggest that entagled simultaneous mesurement for noncommuting observables is
the basis for the observed fermionic multiplets. This generalizes the standard
spin representations for particles arising from Lorentz invariance. We show
that operator entanglement for all quantum observables in the Poincare algebra,
coupled with Fermi-Dirac statistics, mandates six fermions. We propose that the
quark and lepton generations form a super-structure of the Poincare algebra
based on the principles of entangled simultaneity. Mathematically, that
super-structure is known as a Naimark extension. The required entanglement
between particle generations for left-handed quarks is observed in the
Cabbibo-Kobayashi-maskawa matrix. We show that the Naimark-extended von Neumann
lattice is ditributive, thereby suggesting the principle of entangled
simultaneity as a mechanism to avoid quantum non-locality. Keywords: enatangled
simultaneous quantum measurement, Naimark extension, Lepton/quark generations.
