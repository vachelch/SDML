<title>
On the integrability of N=2 supersymmetric massive theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we propose a criteria to establish the integrability of N=2
supersymmetric massive theories.The basic data required are the vacua and the
spectrum of Bogomolnyi solitons, which can be neatly encoded in a graph
(nodes=vacua and links= Bogomolnyi solitons). Integrability is then equivalent
to the existence of solutions of a generalized Yang-Baxter equation which is
built up from the graph (graph-Yang-Baxter equation). We solve this equation
for two general types of graphs: circular and daisy, proving, in particular,
the inte- grability of the following Landau-Ginzburg superpotentials: A_n(t_1),
A_n(t_2), D_n(\tau),E_6(t_7), E_8(t_16). For circular graphs the solutions are
intertwiners of the affine Hopf algebra $\tilde(U)_q(A^{(1)}_1)$, while for
daisy graphs the solution corresponds to a susy generalization of the Boltzmann
weights of the chiral Potts model in the trigonometric regime. A chiral Potts
like solution is conjectured for the more tricky case $ D_n(t_2)$. The
scattering theory of circular models, for instance $A_n(t_1)$ or $D_n(\tau)$,
is Toda like. The physical spectrum of daisy models, as $A_n(t_2), E_6(t_7)$ or
$E_8(t_16)$, is given by confined states of radial solitons. The scattering
theory of the confined states is again Toda like. Bootstrap factors for the
confined solitons are given by fusing the susy chiral Potts S-matrices of the
elementary constituents, i.e. the radial solitons of the daisy graph.
