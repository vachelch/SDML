Winding Number Transitions in the Mottola-Wipf Model on a Circle
</title>

<abstract>
  Winding number transitions from quantum to classical behavior are studied in
the case of the {1+1} dimensional Mottola-Wipf model with the space coordinate
on a circle for exploring the possibility of obtaining transitions of second
order. The model is also studied as a prototype theory which demonstrates the
procedure of such investigations. In the model at hand we find that even on a
circle the transitions remain those of first order.
