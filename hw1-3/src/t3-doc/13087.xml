<title>
One-Loop Threshold Effects in String Unification
</title>

<abstract>
  Like grand unification of old, string unification predicts simple tree-level
relations between the couplings of all unbroken gauge groups such as
$SU(3)_C$ or $SU(2)_W\)$.  I show here how to compute one-loop corrections
to these relations for any four-dimensional model based on a classical
vacuum of the heterotic string.  The result can be used to calculate both
$\sin^2\theta_W$ and $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ in terms of $\alpha_{\rm QED}$ and
$\mpl\)$.
  The original version of this paper was written in 1987 and published in
Nuclear Physics in 1988.  That version had a few factor-of-two errors,
which lead some people into confusion.  To avoid future confusion, I've
written Errata; they are submitted separately to hep-th (article #9205068).
This submission is the complete revised version of the paper.
