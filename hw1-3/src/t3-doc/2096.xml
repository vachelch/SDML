<title>
Pseudoconformal field theory at the "wrong level"
</title>

<abstract>
  Pseudoaffine theories are characterized by formal replacement of the level to
the fractional number: $k\to\frac{k}{q}$, where $q$ is integer strange to
$k(g+k)$ ($g$ - dual Coxeter number). An example of "forbidden" $q$ is
considered (SU(2), $q=2$). The fusions of obtained theory are similar to the
affine ones. Spectra of minimal models are calculated.
