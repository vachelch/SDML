<title>
A Cosmological Mechanism for Stabilizing Moduli
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we show how the generic coupling of moduli to the kinetic
energy of ordinary matter fields results in a cosmological mechanism that
influences the evolution and stability of moduli. As an example, we reconsider
the problem of stabilizing the dilaton in a non-perturbative potential induced
by gaugino condensates. A well-known difficulty is that the potential is so
steep that the dilaton field tends to overrun the correct minimum and to evolve
to an observationally unacceptable vacuum. We show that the dilaton coupling to
the thermal energy of matter fields produces a natural mechanism for gently
relaxing the dilaton field into the correct minimum of the potential without
fine-tuning of initial conditions. The same mechanism is potentially relevant
for stabilizing other moduli fields.
