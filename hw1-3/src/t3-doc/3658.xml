<title>
A Coherent Understanding of Solvable Models for Quantum Measurement
  Processes
</title>

<abstract>
  By making use of Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum, we put
forward an interesting connection among three solvable Hamiltonians, widely
used for discussions on the quantum measurement problem. This connection
implies that a particular macroscopic limit has to be taken for these models to
be physically sensible.
