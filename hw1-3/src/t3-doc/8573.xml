A Note on Quantum Liouville Theory via Quantum Group; an Approach to
  Strong Coupling Liouville Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum Liouville theory is analyzed in terms of the infinite dimensional
representations of $U_Qsl(2,C)$ with q a root of unity. Making full use of
characteristic features of the representations, we show that vertex operators
in this Liouville theory are factorized into `classical' vertex operators and
those which are constructed from the finite dimensional representations of
$U_qsl(2,C)$. We further show explicitly that fusion rules in this model also
enjoys such a factorization. Upon the conjecture that the Liouville action
effectively decouples into the classical Liouville action and that of a quantum
theory, correlation functions and transition amplitudes are discussed,
especially an intimate relation between our model and geometric quantization of
the moduli space of Riemann surfaces is suggested. The most important result is
that our Liouville theory is in the strong coupling region, i.e., the central
charge c_L satisfies $1<c_L<25$. An interpretation of quantum space-time is
also given within this formulation.
