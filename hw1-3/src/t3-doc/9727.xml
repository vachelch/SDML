<title>
D = 1 Supergravity and Spinning Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper I review the multiplet calculus of $N = 1$, $D = 1$ local
supersymmetry with applications to the construction of models for spinning
particles in background fields, and models with space-time supersymmetry. New
features include a non-linear realization of the local supersymmetry algebra
and the coupling to anti-symmetric tensor fields of both odd and even rank. The
non-linear realization allows the construction of a $D = 1$
cosmological-constant term, which provides a mass term in the equations of
motion.
