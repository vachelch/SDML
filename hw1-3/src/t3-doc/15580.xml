Conformal Models of Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence
</title>

<abstract>
  Following the previous work of Ferretti and Yang on the role of magnetic
fields in the theory of conformal turbulence, we show that non-unitary minimal
model solutions to 2-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) obtained by
dimensional reduction from 3-dimensions exist under different (and more
restrictive) conditions. From a 3-dimensional point of view, these conditions
are equivalent to perpendicular flow, in which the magnetic and velocity fields
are orthogonal. We also extend the analysis to the finite conductivity case and
present some approximate solutions, whose connection to the exact ones of the
infinite conductivity case is also discussed.
