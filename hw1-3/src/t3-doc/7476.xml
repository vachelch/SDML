<title>
Kaluza-Klein dipoles, brane/anti-brane pairs and instabilities
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the method of constructing dipole and string loop solutions from
the higher-dimensional (Euclidean) Kerr black hole. We analyse the results in
various dimensions, finding solutions earlier given in the literature. Then we
construct a new heterotic dipole with non-trivial dilaton and gauge fields.
This can, in turn, be describes as a brane/anti-brane pair which interpolates
between the KK-dipole and the H-dipole. Finally an argument is presented on the
tachyonic instability by analysing the string fluctuations on the dipole
background.
