Regularization and Renormalization of Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze some features of the perturbative quantization of Chern-Simons
theory (CST) in the Landau gauge. In this gauge the theory is known to be
perturbatively finite. We consider the renormalization scheme in which the
renormalized parameter $k$ equals the bare or classical one and show that it
constitutes a natural parametrization for the quantum theory. The reason is
that, although in this renormalization scheme the value of the Green functions
depends on the regularization used, comparison among different regularization
methods shows that the observables (Wilson loops) are the same function of the
shifted monodromy parameter $k+c_v$ for all BRS invariant regulators used so
far for CST. We also discuss a particular BRS invariant regularization
prescription in which CST is perturbatively defined as the large mass limit of
dimensionally regularized topologically massive Yang-Mills theory. With this
regularization prescription the radiative corrections induced by two-loop
contributions do not entail observable consequences since they can be
reabsorbed by a finite rescaling of the fields only. This very mechanism is
conjectured to take place at higher perturbative orders. Talk presented by G.G.
