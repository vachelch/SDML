Faddeev-Skyrme Model and Rational Maps
</title>

<abstract>
  The Faddeev-Skyrme model, a modified O(3) nonlinear sigma model in three
space dimensions, is known to admit topological solitons that are stabilized by
the Hopf charge. The Faddeev-Skyrme model is also related to the low-energy
limits of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. Here, the model is reformulated into its
gauge-equivalent expression, which turns out to be Skyrme-like. The solitonic
solutions of this Skyrme-like model are analyzed by the rational map ansatz.
The energy function and the Bogomolny-type lower bound of the energy are
established. The generalized Faddeev-Skyrme model that originates from the
infrared limits of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is presented.
