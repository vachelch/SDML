Symmetrization of Berezin Star Product and Path-Integral Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new star pruduct which interpolates the Berezin and Moyal
quantization. A multiple of this product is shown to reduce to a path-integral
quantization in the continuous time limit. In flat space the action becomes the
one of free bosonic strings. Relation to Kontsevich prescription is also
discussed.
