<title>
A Discretized Version of Kaluza-Klein Theory with Torsion and Massive
  Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an internal space of two discrete points in the fifth dimension
of the Kaluza-Klein theory by using the formalism of noncommutative geometry
developed in a previous paper \cite{VIWA} of a spacetime supplemented by two
discrete points. With the nonvanishing internal torsion 2-form there are no
constraints implied on the vielbeins. The theory contains a pair of tensor, a
pair of vector and a pair of scalar fields. Using the generalized Cartan
structure equation we are able not only to determine uniquely the hermitian and
metric compatible connection 1-forms, but also the nonvanishing internal
torsion 2-form in terms of vielbeins. The resulting action has a rich and
complex structure, a particular feature being the existence of massive modes.
Thus the nonvanishing internal torsion generates a Kaluza-Klein type model with
zero and massive modes.
