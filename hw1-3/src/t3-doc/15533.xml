D-branes in Gepner models and supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Boundary states corresponding to wrapped D-branes in Calabi-Yau
compactifications of type II strings are discussed using Gepner models. In
particular boundary conditions corresponding to D-0 branes and D-instantons in
four dimensions are investigated. The boundary states constructed by Recknagel
and Schomerus are analyzed in the light-cone gauge and the broken and conserved
space-time supersymmetry charges are found. The geometrical interpretation of
these algebraically constructed boundary states is clarified in some simple
cases. Moreover, the action of mirror symmetry and other discrete symmetries of
the Gepner model on the boundary states are discussed. As an application the
boundary states are used to calculate instanton induced corrections to metric
on the hypermultiplets in the N=2 effective action.
