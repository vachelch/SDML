Exact Solutions For Correlation Functions In Some 1+1 D Field Theories
  With Boundary
</title>

<abstract>
We consider 1+1 D theories which are free everywhere except for cosine and
magnetic interactions on the boundary. These theories arise in dissipative
quantum systems, open string theory, and, in special cases, tunneling in
quantum Hall systems. These boundary systems satisfy an approximate SL(2,Z)
symmetry as a function of flux per unit cell and dissipation. At special
multicritical points, they also satisfy a set of reparametrization Ward
identities and have homogeneous, piecewise-linear correlation functions in
momentum space. In this paper, we use these symmetries to find exact solutions
for some of the correlation functions. We also comment on the form of the
correlation functions in general, and verify that the SL(2,Z) duality
transformation between different critical points is satisfied exactly in all
cases where the full solution is known.
