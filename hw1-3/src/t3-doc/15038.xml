<title>
Non-orientable string one-loop corrections in the presence of a B field
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the problem of noncommutative SO(N) gauge field theories from the
string one-loop point of view. To this end we propose an expression for the
string propagator on the boundary of the Moebius strip in the presence of a
constant B field. We discuss in detail the problems related to its derivation.
Then we use it to compute the one-loop corrections to two-, three- and
four-gluon amplitudes in an open string theory with orthogonal Chan-Paton
factors. We show that these corrections in the field theory limit in 4D are
compatible with the one-loop corrections of a renormalizable noncommutative
SO(N) gauge field theory.
