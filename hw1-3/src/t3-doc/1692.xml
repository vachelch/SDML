Non-Abelian Conifold Transitions and N=4 Dualities in Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how Higgs mechanism for non-abelian N=2 gauge theories in four
dimensions is geometrically realized in the context of type II strings as
transitions among compactifications of Calabi-Yau threefolds. We use this
result and T-duality of a further compacitification on a circle to derive N=4,
d=3 dual field theories. This reduces dualities for N=4 gauge systems in three
dimensions to perturbative symmetries of string theory. Moreover we find that
the dual of a gauge system always exists but may or may not correspond to a
lagrangian system. In particular we verify a conjecture of Intriligator and
Seiberg that an ordinary gauge system is dual to compactification of
Exceptional tensionless string theory down to three dimensions.
