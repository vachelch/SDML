D-branes on Stringy Calabi-Yau Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that D-branes corresponding to rational B boundary states in a
Gepner model can be understood as fractional branes in the Landau-Ginzburg
orbifold phase of the linear sigma model description. Combining this idea with
the generalized McKay correspondence allows us to identify these states with
coherent sheaves, and to calculate their K-theory classes in the large volume
limit, without needing to invoke mirror symmetry. We check this identification
against the mirror symmetry results for the example of the Calabi-Yau
hypersurface in $\WP^{1,1,2,2,2}$.
