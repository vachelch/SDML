On Certain Quantum Deformations of $gl(N,R)$
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper all deformations of the general linear group, subject to
certain restrictions which in particular ensure a smooth passage to the Lie
group limit, are obtained. Representations are given in terms of certains sets
of creation and annihilation operators. These creation and annihilation
operators may belong to a generalisation of the $q$-quark type or $q$-hadronic
type, of $q$-boson or $q$-fermion type. We are also led to a natural definition
of $q$-direct sums of q-algebras.
