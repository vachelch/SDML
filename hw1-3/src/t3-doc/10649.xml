Walls from fluxes: An analytic RG-flow
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct supergravity solutions describing the near horizon limit of D1D5
systems with non-trivial boundary conditions. Upon reduction to five dimensions
they define Melvin universes with NS--NS/RR fluxes, that smoothly interpolate
between two different AdS_3 geometries which define fixed points for the
RG--flow of the dual field theory. We discuss the decoupling limits at the two
ends of the flow. We also present a systematic study of the global properties
of our solution. In particular we show how, although the AdS_3 x S^3 global
isometry group is broken down to SU(2)_R x U(1)^3 by global identifications, a
full two-dimensional conformal group of isometries, with the expected central
charge, is restored at infinity.
