How massless are massless fields in $AdS_d$
</title>

<abstract>
  Massless fields of generic Young symmetry type in $AdS_d$ space are analyzed.
It is demonstrated that in contrast to massless fields in Minkowski space whose
physical degrees of freedom transform in irreps of $o(d-2)$ algebra, $AdS$
massless mixed symmetry fields reduce to a number of irreps of $o(d-2)$
algebra. From the field theory perspective this means that not every massless
field in flat space admits a deformation to $AdS_d$ with the same number of
degrees of freedom, because it is impossible to keep all of the flat space
gauge symmetries unbroken in the AdS space. An equivalent statement is that,
generic irreducible AdS massless fields reduce to certain reducible sets of
massless fields in the flat limit. A conjecture on the general pattern of the
flat space limit of a general $AdS_d$ massless field is made. The example of
the three-cell ``hook'' Young diagram is discussed in detail. In particular, it
is shown that only a combination of the three-cell flat-space field with a
graviton-like field admits a smooth deformation to $AdS_d$.
