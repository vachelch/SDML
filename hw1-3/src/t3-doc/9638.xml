One-instanton predictions for non-hyperelliptic curves derived from
  M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  One-instanton predictions are obtained from certain non-hyperelliptic
Seiberg-Witten curves derived from M-theory for N=2 supersymmetric gauge
theories. We consider SU(N_1)\times SU(N_2) gauge theory with a hypermultiplet
in the bifundamental representation together with hypermultiplets in the
defining representations of SU(N_1) and SU(N_2). We also consider SU(N) gauge
theory with a hypermultiplet in the symmetric or antisymmetric representation,
together with hypermultiplets in the defining representation. The systematic
perturbation expansion about a hyperelliptic curve together with the judicious
use of an involution map for the curve of the product groups provide the
principal tools of the calculations.
