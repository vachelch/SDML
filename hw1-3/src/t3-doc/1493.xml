D-Branes in Landau-Ginzburg Models and Algebraic Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study topological D-branes of type B in N=2 Landau-Ginzburg models,
focusing on the case where all vacua have a mass gap. In general, tree-level
topological string theory in the presence of topological D-branes is described
mathematically in terms of a triangulated category. For example, it has been
argued that B-branes for an N=2 sigma-model with a Calabi-Yau target space are
described by the derived category of coherent sheaves on this space. M.
Kontsevich previously proposed a candidate category for B-branes in N=2
Landau-Ginzburg models, and our computations confirm this proposal. We also
give a heuristic physical derivation of the proposal. Assuming its validity, we
can completely describe the category of B-branes in an arbitrary massive
Landau-Ginzburg model in terms of modules over a Clifford algebra. Assuming in
addition Homological Mirror Symmetry, our results enable one to compute the
Fukaya category for a large class of Fano varieties. We also provide a
(somewhat trivial) counter-example to the hypothesis that given a closed string
background there is a unique set of D-branes consistent with it.
