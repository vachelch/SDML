The Coulomb Branch of Gauge Theory from Rotating Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  At zero temperature the Coulomb Branch of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills
theory is described in supergravity by multi-center solutions with D3-brane
charge. At finite temperature and chemical potential the vacuum degeneracy is
lifted, and minima of the free energy are shown to have a supergravity
description as rotating black D3-branes.
  In the extreme limit these solutions single out preferred points on the
moduli space that can be interpreted as simple distributions of branes --- for
instance, a uniformly charged planar disc. We exploit this geometrical
representation to study the thermodynamics of rotating black D3-branes. The low
energy excitations of the system appear to be governed by an effective string
theory which is related to the singularity in spacetime.
