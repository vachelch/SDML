Penrose Limits and Non-local theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate Penrose limits of two classes of non-local theories, little
string theories and non-commutative gauge theories. Penrose limits of the
near-horizon geometry of NS5-branes help to shed some light on the high energy
spectrum of little string theories. We attempt to understand renormalization
group flow in these theories by considering Penrose limits wherein the null
geodesic also has a radial component. In particular, we demonstrate that it is
possible to construct a pp-wave spacetime which interpolates between the linear
dilaton and the AdS regions for the Type IIA NS5-brane. Similar analysis is
considered for the holographic dual geometry to non-commutative field theories.
