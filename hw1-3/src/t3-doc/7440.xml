Critical Coupling in (1+1)-Dimensional Light-Front $\phi^{4}$ Theory. II
  -effects of non-diagonal interactionof non-diagonal interactions-
</title>

<abstract>
  Spontaneous symmetry breaking in (1+1)-dimensional $\phi^{4}$ theory is
studied with discretized light-front quantization. Taking effects of
non-diagonal interactions into account, the first few terms of the commutation
relations $[a_{0},a_{n}]$ are recalculated in the $\hbar$ expansion. Our result
of the critical coupling is still consistent with the equal-time result
$22\mu^{2}/\hbar \le \lambda_{\rm{cr}} \le 55.5\mu^{2}/\hbar$. We also have
examined effects of regarding the ratio of the bare coupling constant to a
renormalized mass as an independent parameter in the $\hbar$ expansion.
