Polyakov's spin factor and new algorithms for efficient perturbative
  computations in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Polyakov's spin factor enters as a weight in the path-integral description of
particle-like modes propagating in Euclidean space-times, accounting for
particle spin. The Fock-Feynman-Schwinger path integral applied to QCD
accomodates Polyakov's spin factor in a natural manner while, at the same time,
it identifies Wilson line (loop) operators as sole agents of interaction
dynamics among matter and gauge field quanta. A direct application of such a
separation between spin content and dynamics is the emergence of master
expressions for the perturbative series involving either open or closed
fermionic lines which provide new, comprehensive approaches to perturbative
QCD.
