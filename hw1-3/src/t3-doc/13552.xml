All Or Nothing: On the Small Fluctuations of Two-Dimensional
  String-Theoretic Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  A comprehensive analysis of small fluctuations about two-dimensional
string-theoretic and string-inspired black holes is presented. It is shown with
specific examples that two-dimensional black holes behave in a radically
different way from all known black holes in four dimensions. For both the
$SL(2,R)/U(1)$ black hole and the two-dimensional black hole coupled to a
massive dilaton with constant field strength, it is shown that there are a {\it
continuous infinity} of solutions to the linearized equations of motion, which
are such that it is impossible to ascertain the classical linear response. It
is further shown that the two-dimensional black hole coupled to a massive,
linear dilaton admits {\it no small fluctuations at all}. We discuss possible
implications of our results for the Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger black
hole.
