N=(4,2) Chiral Supergravity in Six Dimensions and Solvable Lie Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Decomposition of the solvable Lie algebras of maximal supergravities in D=4,
5 and 6 indicates, at least at the geometrical level, the existence of an
N=(4,2) chiral supergravity theory in D=6 dimensions. This theory, with 24
supercharges, reduces to the known N=6 supergravity after a toroidal
compactification to D=5 and D=4. Evidence for this theory was given long ago by
B. Julia. We show that this theory suffers from a gravitational anomaly equal
to 4/7 of the pure N=(4,0) supergravity anomaly. However, unlike the latter,
the absence of N=(4,2) matter to cancel the anomaly presumably makes this
theory inconsistent. We discuss the obstruction in defining this theory in D=6,
starting from an N=6 five-dimensional string model in the decompactification
limit. The set of massless states necessary for the anomaly cancellation
appears in this limit; as a result the N=(4,2) supergravity in D=6 is extended
to N=(4,4) maximal supergravity theory.
