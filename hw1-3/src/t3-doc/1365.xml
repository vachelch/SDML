General Superfield Quantization Method. I. General Superfield Theory of
  Fields: Lagrangian Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  The rules for constructing Lagrangian formulation for general superfield
theory of fields (GSTF) are introduced and considered on the whole in the
framework of proposed here new general superfield quantization method for
general gauge theories.
  Algebraic, group-theoretic and analytic description aspects for
supervariables over (Grassmann) algebras containing anticommuting generating
element $\theta$ and interpreted further in particular as an "odd" time are
examined.
  Superfunction $S_{L}(\theta) \equiv S_{L}({\cal A}(\theta), \frac{d{{\cal
A}}(\theta)} {d\theta\phantom{xx}}, \theta)$ and its global symmetries are
defined on the extended space (supermanifold) $T_{odd}{\cal M}_{cl} \times
\{\theta\}$ parametrized by local coordinates: superfields ${{\cal
A}}^{\imath}(\theta), \frac{d{{\cal A}}^{\imath}(\theta)}{d\theta
\phantom{xxx}}, \theta$. Extremality properties of the superfunctional $Z[{\cal
A}]=\int d\theta S_{L}(\theta)$ are analyzed together with properties of
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations. System of definitions for Lagrangian
formulation of GSTF is suggested.
  Component (on $\theta$) formulation for GSTF variables and operations is
produced. Analogy between objects and relations of the ordinary classical
mechanics and GSTF in Lagrangian formulation is proposed. Realization of the
constructions of GSTF is demonstrated on two concrete models.
