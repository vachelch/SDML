<title>
Dirac variables in gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The review is devoted to a relativistic formulation of the first Dirac
quantization of QED (1927) and its generalization to the non-Abelian theories
(Yang-Mills and QCD) with the topological degeneration of initial data. Using
the Dirac variables we give a systematic description of relativistic nonlocal
bound states in QED with a choice of the time axis of quantization along the
eigenvectors of their total momentum operator.
  We show that the Dirac variables of the non-Abelian fields are topologically
degenerated, and there is a pure gauge Higgs effect in the sector of the zero
winding number that leads to a nonperturbative physical vacuum in the form of
the Wu-Yang monopole. Phases of the topological degeneration in the new
perturbation theory are determined by an equation of the Gribov ambiguity of
the constraint-shell gauge defined as an integral of the Gauss equation with
zero initial data. The constraint-shell non-Abelian dynamics includes zero mode
of the Gauss law differential operator, and a rising potential of the
instantaneous interaction, that rearranges the perturbation series and changes
the assymptotic freedom formula.
  The Dirac variables in QCD with the topological degeneration of initial data
describe constituent gluon, and quark masses, the spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking, color confinement in the form of quark-hadron duality as a
consequence of summing over the Gribov copies. A solution of U(1)-problem is
given by mixing the zero mode with $\eta_0$ - meson. We discuss reasons why all
these physical effects disappear for arbitrary gauges of physical sources in
the standard Faddeev-Popov integral.
