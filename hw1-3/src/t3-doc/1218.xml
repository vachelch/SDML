Three loop MSbar renormalization of the Curci-Ferrari model and the
  dimension two BRST invariant composite operator in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The massless Curci-Ferrari model with N_f flavours of quarks is renormalized
to three loops in the MSbar scheme in an arbitrary covariant gauge with
parameter alpha. The renormalization of the BRST invariant dimension two
composite operator, 1/2 (A^a_\mu)^2 - alpha \bar{c}^a c^a, which corresponds to
the mass operator in the massive Curci-Ferrari model, is determined by
renormalizing the Green's function where the operator is inserted in a ghost
two-point function. Consequently the anomalous dimension of the QCD Landau
gauge operator, 1/2 (A^a_\mu)^2, and the (gauge independent) photon mass
anomalous dimension in QED are both deduced at three loops.
