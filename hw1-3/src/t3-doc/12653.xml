Gaugino Condensation in M-theory on S^1/Z_2
</title>

<abstract>
  In the low energy limit of for M-theory on S^1/Z_2, we calculate the gaugino
condensate potential in four dimensions using the background solutions due to
Horava. We show that this potential is free of delta-function singularities and
has the same form as the potential in the weakly coupled heterotic string. A
general flux quantization rule for the three-form field of M-theory on S^1/Z_2
is given and checked in certain limiting cases. This rule is used to fix the
free parameter in the potential originating from a zero mode of the form field.
Finally, we calculate soft supersymmetry breaking terms. We find that
corrections to the Kahler potential and the gauge kinetic function, which can
be large in the strongly coupled region, contribute significantly to certain
soft terms. In particular, for supersymmetry breaking in the T-modulus
direction, the small values of gaugino masses and trilinear couplings that
occur in the weakly coupled, large radius regime are enhanced to order m_3/2 in
M-theory. The scalar soft masses remain small even, in the strong coupling
M-theory limit.
