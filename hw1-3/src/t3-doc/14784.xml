<title>
A Geometric Approach to Massive p-form Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  Massive theories of abelian p-forms are quantized in a generalized
path-representation that leads to a description of the phase space in terms of
a pair of dual non-local operators analogous to the Wilson Loop and the 't
Hooft disorder operators. Special atention is devoted to the study of the
duality between the Topologically Massive and the Self-Dual models in 2+1
dimensions. It is shown that these models share a geometric representation in
which just one non local operator suffices to describe the observables.
