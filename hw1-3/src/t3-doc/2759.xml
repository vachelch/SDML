<title>
Dynamical Generation of Four-Dimensional Space-Time in the IIB Matrix
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the spontaneous breakdown of SO(10) symmetry in the IIB matrix
model, a conjectured nonperturbative definition of type IIB superstring theory
in ten dimensions. Our analysis is based on a Gaussian expansion technique,
which was originally proposed by Kabat-Lifschytz and applied successfully to
the strong coupling dynamics of the Matrix Theory. We propose a prescription
for including higher order corrections, which yields a rapid convergence in a
simple example. This prescription is then applied to the IIB matrix model up to
the third order. We find that the `self-consistency equations' allow various
symmetry breaking solutions. Among them, the solution preserving SO(4) symmetry
is found to have the smallest free energy. The value of the free energy comes
closer to the analytic formula obtained by Krauth-Nicolai-Staudacher as we
increase the order. The extent of the space-time in the 4 directions is larger
than the remaining 6 directions, and the ratio increases with the order. These
results provide the first analytical evidence that four-dimensional space-time
is generated dynamically in the IIB matrix model.
