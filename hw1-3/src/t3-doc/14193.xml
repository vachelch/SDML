Standard Model with Duality: Theoretical Basis
</title>

<abstract>
  The Dualized Standard Model which has a number of very interesting physical
consequences is itself based on the concept of a nonabelian generalization to
electric-magnetic duality. This paper explains first the reasons why the
ordinary (Hodge) * does not give duality for the nonabelian theory and then
reviews the steps by which these difficulties are surmounted, leading to a
generalized duality transform formulated in loop space. The significance of
this in relation to the Dualized Standard Model is explained, and possibly also
to some other areas.
