<title>
Boundary dynamics and the statistical mechanics of the 2+1 dimensional
  black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the density of states of the 2+1 dimensional BTZ black hole in
the micro- and grand-canonical ensembles. Our starting point is the relation
between 2+1 dimensional quantum gravity and quantised Chern-Simons theory. In
the micro-canonical ensemble, we find the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy by
relating a Kac-Moody algebra of global gauge charges to a Virasoro algebra with
a classical central charge via a twisted Sugawara construction. This
construction is valid at all values of the black hole radius. At infinity it
gives the asymptotic isometries of the black hole, and at the horizon it gives
an explicit form for a set of deformations of the horizon whose algebra is the
same Virasoro algebra. In the grand-canonical ensemble we define the partition
function by using a surface term at infinity that is compatible with fixing the
temperature and angular velocity of the black hole. We then compute the
partition function directly in a boundary Wess-Zumino-Witten theory, and find
that we obtain the correct result only after we include a source term at the
horizon that induces a non-trivial spin-structure on the WZW partition
function.
