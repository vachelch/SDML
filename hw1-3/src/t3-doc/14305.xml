Use of Nilpotent weights in Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that logarithmic conformal field theories may be derived using
nilpotent scale transformation. Using such nilpotent weights we derive
properties of LCFT's, such as two and three point correlation functions solely
from symmetry arguments. Singular vectors and the Kac determinant may also be
obtained using these nilpotent variables, hence the structure of the four point
functions can also be derived. This leads to non homogeneous hypergeometric
functions. Also we consider LCFT's near a boundary. Constructing "superfields"
using a nilpotent variable, we show that the superfield of conformal weight
zero, composed of the identity and the pseudo identity is related to a
superfield of conformal dimension two, which comprises of energy momentum
tensor and its logarithmic partner. This device also allows us to derive the
operator product expansion for logarithmic operators. Finally we discuss the
AdS/LCFT correspondence and derive some correlation functions and a BRST
symmetry.
