<title>
Gauge Fields Condensation at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The two-loop effective action for the SU(3) gauge model in a constant
background field ${\bar A}_0(x,t)=B_0^3T_3+B_0^8T_8$ is recalculated for a
gauge with an arbitrary $\xi$-parameter. The gauge-invariant thermodynamical
potential is found and its extremum points are investigated. Within a two-loop
order we find that the stable nontrivial vacuum is completely equivalent to the
trivial one but when the high order corrections being taken into account the
indifferent equilibrium seems to be broken. Briefly we also discuss the
infrared peculiarities and their status for the gauge models with a nonzero
condensate.
