<title>
Correlations, Decoherence, Dissipation, and Noise in Quantum Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The statistical mechanical properties of interacting quantum fields in terms
of the dynamics of the correlation functions are investigated. We show how the
Dyson - Schwinger equations may be derived from a formal action functional, the
n-particle irreducible ($nPI, n \to \infty$) or the `master' effective action.
It is related to the decoherence functional between histories defined in terms
of correlations. Upon truncation of the Dyson - Schwinger hierarchy at a
certain order, the master effective action becomes complex, its imaginary part
arising from the higher order correlation functions, the fluctuations of which
we define as the correlation noises of that order. Decoherence of correlation
histories via these noises gives rise to classical stochastic histories %driven
by the flucutations of these higher correlation functions. Ordinary quantum
field theory corresponds to taking the lowest order functions, usually the mean
field and the 2-point functions. As such, our reasoning shows that it is an
effective theory which can be intrinsically dissipative. The relation of loop
expansion and correlation order as well as the introduction of an arrow of time
from the choice of boundary conditions are expounded with regard to the origin
of dissipation in quantum fields. Relation with critical phenomena, quantum
transport, molecular hydrodynamics and potential applications to quantum
gravity, early universe processes and black hole physics are mentioned.
