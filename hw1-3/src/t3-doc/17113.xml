Let the spin and the charges unify
</title>

<abstract>
  In space of d ordinary and d Grassmann coordinates, with d \ge 15, the
charges unify with the spin: the Lorentz group SO(1, d-1) in Grassmann space
manifests under certain conditions as SO(1,3) (in d=4 subspace) times SO(10)
\supset SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) (in the rest of the space),
accordingly the symmetry group of the S- matrix, which is approximatelly
unitary in d=4 ordinary subspace, manifests as the direct product of the
Poincar\'e group in d=4 subspace and the group describing charges. (Talk
presented at XIX Triangular Meeting on Recent Development in Quantum
Theories, Rome, March 1996 and at IWCQIS 96, Dubna, July 1996.)
