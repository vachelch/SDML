Open strings in the plane wave background II: Superalgebras and Spectra
</title>

<abstract>
  In hep-th/0211011 we started a systematic investigation of open strings in
the plane wave background. In this paper we continue the analysis by discussing
the superalgebras of conserved charges, the spectra of open strings, and the
spectra of DBI fluctuations around D-brane embeddings. We also derive the
gluing conditions for corresponding boundary states and analyze their
symmetries. All results are consistent with each other, and confirm the
existence of additional supersymmetries as previously discussed. We further
show that for every symmetry current one can construct a (countably) infinite
number of related currents that contain more worldsheet derivatives, and
discuss non-local symmetries.
