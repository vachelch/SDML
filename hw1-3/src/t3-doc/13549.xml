<title>
On schizosymmetric superfields and sl(2/1,C)_R supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Superfield expansions over four-dimensional graded spacetime
$(x^\mu,\theta^\nu)$, with Minkowski coordinates $x$ extended by vector
Grassmann variables $\theta$, are investigated. By appropriate identification
of the physical Lorentz algebra in the even and odd parts of the superfield, a
typology of `schizofields' containing both integer and half-integer spin fields
is established. For two of these types, identified as `gauge potential'-like
and `field strength'-like schizofields, an $sl(2/1,{\mathbb C})_{\mathbb R}$
supersymmetry at the component field level is demonstrated. Prospects for a
schizofield calculus, and application of these types of fields to the particle
spectrum, are adumbrated.
