Large-n Critical Behavior of O(n)xO(m) Spin Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian with O(n)x O(m) symmetry
and compute the critical exponents at all fixed points to O(n^{-2}) and to
O(\epsilon^3) in a \epsilon=4-d expansion. We also consider the corresponding
non-linear sigma model and determine the fixed points and the critical
exponents to O(\tilde{\epsilon}^2) in the \tilde{\epsilon}=d-2 expansion. Using
these results, we draw quite general conclusions on the fixed-point structure
of models with O(n)xO(m) symmetry for n large and all 2 < d < 4.
