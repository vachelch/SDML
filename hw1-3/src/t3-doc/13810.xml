N=8 matter coupled AdS_3 supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
  Following the recent construction of maximal (N=16) gauged supergravity in
three dimensions, we derive gauged D=3, N=8 supergravities in three dimensions
as deformations of the corresponding ungauged theories with scalar manifolds
SO(8,n)/(SO(8)x SO(n)). As a special case, we recover the N=(4,4) theories with
local SO(4) = SO(3)_L x SO(3)_R, which reproduce the symmetries and massless
spectrum of D=6, N=(2,0) supergravity compactified on AdS_3 x S^3.
