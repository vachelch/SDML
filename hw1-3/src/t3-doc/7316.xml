<title>
Numerical knot invariants of finite type from Chern-Simons perturbation
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Chern-Simons gauge theory for compact semisimple groups is analyzed from a
perturbation theory point of view. The general form of the perturbative series
expansion of a Wilson line is presented in terms of the Casimir operators of
the gauge group. From this expansion new numerical knot invariants are
obtained. These knot invariants turn out to be of finite type (Vassiliev
invariants), and to possess an integral representation. Using known results
about Jones, HOMFLY, Kauffman and Akutsu-Wadati polynomial invariants these new
knot invariants are computed up to type six for all prime knots up to six
crossings. Our results suggest that these knot invariants can be normalized in
such a way that they are integer-valued.
