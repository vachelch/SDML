Aspects of the q-deformed Fuzzy Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  These notes are a short review of the q-deformed fuzzy sphere S^2_{q,N},
which is a ``finite'' noncommutative 2-sphere covariant under the quantum group
U_q(su(2)). We discuss its real structure, differential calculus and
integration for both real q and q a phase, and show how actions for Yang-Mills
and Chern- Simons-like gauge theories arise naturally. It is related to
D-branes on the SU(2)_k WZW model for q = exp(\frac{i \pi}{k+2}).
