<title>
Dual versions of extended supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
   Recently, using the model of $N=2$ supergravity --- vector multiplets
interaction with the scalar field geometry $SU(1,m)/SU(m)\otimes U(1)$ as an
example, we have shown that even when the scalar field geometry is fixed, one
can have a whole family of the Lagrangians, which differ by vector field
duality transformation. In this paper we carry out the construction of such
families for the case of $N=3$ and $N=4$ supergravities, the scalar field
geometry being $SU(3,m)/SU(3)\otimes SU(m)\otimes U(1)$ and
$SU(1,1)/U(1)\otimes O(6,m)/O(6)\otimes O(m)$, correspondingly. Moreover, it
turns out that these families contain, as a partial case, the models describing
the interaction of arbitrary number of vector multiplets with our hidden
sectors, admitting spontaneous supersymmetry breaking without a cosmological
term.
