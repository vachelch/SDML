<title>
A nonmeromorphic extension of the moonshine module vertex operator
  algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a natural structure of an abelian intertwining algebra (in the
sense of Dong and Lepowsky) on the direct sum of the untwisted vertex operator
algebra constructed {}from the Leech lattice and its (unique) irreducible
twisted module. When restricting ourselves to the moonshine module, we obtain a
new and conceptual proof that the moonshine module has a natural structure of a
vertex operator algebra. This abelian intertwining algebra also contains an
irreducible twisted module for the moonshine module with respect to the obvious
involution. In addition, it contains a vertex operator superalgebra and a
twisted module for this vertex operator superalgebra with respect to the
involution which is the identity on the even subspace and is $-1$ on the odd
subspace. It also gives the superconformal structures observed by Dixon,
Ginsparg and Harvey.
