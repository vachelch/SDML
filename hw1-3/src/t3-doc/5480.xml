Fluctuations of a (Tensionless) Brane World
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the quantum fluctuations of a 3-brane with tension, energy density
and stiffness. As a result of the fluctuations there are induced forces between
massive objects living on the brane. We study various limiting cases of the
induced potential between 2 and 3 massive objects. One quite interesting
finding is that for tensionless brane world there are universal (mass
independent) $1/r^3$ forces between the objects on the brane. These forces are
in principle measurable.
