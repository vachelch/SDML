<title>
Deformed Heisenberg algebra, fractional spin fields and supersymmetry
  without fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  Within a group-theoretical approach to the description of (2+1)-dimensional
anyons, the minimal covariant set of linear differential equations is
constructed for the fractional spin fields with the help of the deformed
Heisenberg algebra (DHA), $[a^{-},a^{+}]=1+\nu K$, involving the Klein operator
$K$, $\{K,a^{\pm}\}=0$, $K^{2}=1$. The connection of the minimal set of
equations with the earlier proposed `universal' vector set of anyon equations
is established. On the basis of this algebra, a bosonization of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics is carried out. The construction comprises the cases of exact
and spontaneously broken $N=2$ supersymmetry allowing us to realize a
Bose-Fermi transformation and spin-1/2 representation of SU(2) group in terms
of one bosonic oscillator. The construction admits an extension to the case of
OSp(2$\vert$2) supersymmetry, and, as a consequence, both applications of the
DHA turn out to be related. A possibility of `superimposing' the two
applications of the DHA for constructing a supersymmetric (2+1)-dimensional
anyon system is discussed. As a consequential result we point out that
$osp(2|2)$ superalgebra is realizable as an operator algebra for a quantum
mechanical 2-body (nonsupersymmetric) Calogero model.
