Quantum Weyl algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  For any Hecke symmetry $R$ there is a natural quantization $A_n(R)$ of the
Weyl algebra $A_n$. The aim of this paper is to study some general
ring-theoretic aspects of $A_n(R)$ and its relations to formal deformations of
$A_n$. We also obtain further information on those quantizations obtained from
some well-known Hecke symmetries.
