Quantum Generation of the non-Abelian SU(N) Gauge Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we investigate a generation mechanism of the non-Abelian gauge
fields in the SU(N) gauge theory. It is shown that the SU(N) gauge fields
ensuring the local invariance of the theory are generated at the quantum level
only due to nonsmoothness of the scalar phases of the fundamental spinor
fields. The expression for the gauge fields are obtained in terms of the
nonsmooth scalar phases.
