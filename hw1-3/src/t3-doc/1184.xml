Noncommutative renormalization for massless QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the renormalization of massless QED from the point of view of the
Hopf algebra discovered by D. Kreimer. For QED, we describe a Hopf algebra of
renormalization which is neither commutative nor cocommutative. We obtain
explicit renormalization formulas for the electron and photon propagators, for
the vacuum polarization and the electron self-energy, which are equivalent to
Zimmermann's forest formula for the sum of all Feynman diagrams at a given
order of interaction.
  Then we extend to QED the Connes-Kreimer map defined by the coupling constant
of the theory (i.e. the homomorphism between some formal diffeomorphisms and
the Hopf algebra of renormalization) by defining a noncommutative Hopf algebra
of diffeomorphisms, and then showing that the renormalization of the electric
charge defines a homomorphism between this Hopf algebra and the Hopf algebra of
renormalization of QED.
  Finally we show that Dyson's formulas for the renormalization of the electron
and photon propagators can be given in a noncommutative (e.g. matrix-valued)
form.
