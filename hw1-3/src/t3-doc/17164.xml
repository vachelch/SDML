Axion perturbation spectra in string cosmologies
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the semi-classical perturbation spectra produced in the massless
fields of the low energy string action in a pre big bang type scenario. Axion
fields may possess an almost scale-invariant spectrum on large scales dependent
upon the evolution of the dilaton and moduli fields to which they are coupled.
As an example we calculate the spectra for three axion fields present in a
truncated type IIB model and show that they are related with at least one of
the fields having a scale-invariant or red perturbation spectrum. In the
simplest pre big bang scenario this may be inconsistent with the observed
isotropy of the microwave background. More generally, relations between the
perturbation spectra in low energy string cosmologies reflect the symmetries of
the theory.
