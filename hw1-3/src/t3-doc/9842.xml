<title>
The quantization of the chiral Schwinger model based on the BFT-BFV
  formalism II
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply an improved version of Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin (BFT) Hamiltonian
method to the a=1 chiral Schwinger Model, which is much more nontrivial than
the a>1.$ one. Furthermore, through the path integral quantization, we newly
resolve the problem of the non-trivial $\delta$ function as well as that of the
unwanted Fourier parameter $\xi$ in the measure. As a result, we explicitly
obtain the fully gauge invariant partition function, which includes a new type
of Wess-Zumino (WZ) term irrelevant to the gauge symmetry as well as usual WZ
action.
