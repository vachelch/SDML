New Jacobi-Like Identities for Z_k Parafermion Characters
</title>

<abstract>
  We state and prove various new identities involving the Z_K parafermion
characters (or level-K string functions) for the cases K=4, K=8, and K=16.
These identities fall into three classes: identities in the first class are
generalizations of the famous Jacobi theta-function identity (which is the K=2
special case), identities in another class relate the level K>2 characters to
the Dedekind eta-function, and identities in a third class relate the K>2
characters to the Jacobi theta-functions. These identities play a crucial role
in the interpretation of fractional superstring spectra by indicating spacetime
supersymmetry and aiding in the identification of the spacetime spin and
statistics of fractional superstring states.
