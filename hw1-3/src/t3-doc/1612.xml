Flavor Symmetry Breaking in Strongly Coupled N=1 Supersymmetric SO(N_c)
  Gauge Theory with N_f=N_c-2
</title>

<abstract>
  In the SO(N_c) gauge theory with N_f quarks for N_f=N_c-2, its instanton
effects indicate the signal of dynamical flavor symmetry breakdown of SU(N_f)
to SO(N_f), which is not described by the conventional "magnetic" degree's of
freedom. It is argued that this breaking is well described by our effective
superpotential consisting of "electric" quarks and gluons instead of monopoles
of SO(N_c). The low-energy particles include the Nambu-Goldstone superfields
associated with this breakdown. The proposed superpotential is found to exhibit
the holomorphic decoupling property and the anomaly-matching property on a
residual chiral U(1) symmetry.
