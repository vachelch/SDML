<title>
Unification of SU(2)xU(1) Using a Generalized Covariant Derivative and
  U(3)
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalization of the Yang-Mills covariant derivative, that uses both
vector and scalar fields and transforms as a 4-vector contracted with Dirac
matrices, is used to simplify and unify the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model. Since
SU(3) assigns the wrong hypercharge to the Higgs boson, it is necessary to use
a special representation of U(3) to obtain all the correct quantum numbers. A
surplus gauge scalar boson emerges in the process, but it uncouples from all
other particles.
