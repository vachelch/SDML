Quantum electrodynamics in the squeezed vacuum state: Electron mass
  shift
</title>

<abstract>
  Due to the nonvanishing average photon population of the squeezed vacuum
state, finite corrections to the scattering matrix are obtained. The lowest
order contribution to the electron mass shift for a one mode squeezed vacuum
state is given by $\delta m(\Omega, s)/m=\alpha (2/\pi)(\Omega
/m)^2\sinh^2(s)$, where $\Omega$ and $s$ stand for the mode frequency and the
squeeze parameter and $\alpha$ for the fine structure constant, respectively.
