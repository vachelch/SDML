Superstring Theory on AdS_3 x G/H and Boundary N=3 Superconformal
  Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Superstrings propagating on backgrounds of the form AdS_3 x G/H are studied
using the coset CFT approach. We focus on seven dimensional cosets which have a
semiclassical limit, and which give rise to N=3 superconformal symmetry in the
dual CFT. This is realized for the two cases AdS_3 x SU(3)/U(1) and AdS_3 x
SO(5)/SO(3), for which we present an explicit construction. We also provide
sufficient conditions on a CFT background to enable a similar construction, and
comment on the geometrical interpretation of our results.
