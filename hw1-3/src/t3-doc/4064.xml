Truncations of the D9-brane action and type-I strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The low-energy effective action of type-I superstring theory in ten
dimensions is obtained performing a truncation of type-IIB supergravity in a
background where D9-branes are present. The open sector corresponds to the
first order in the low-energy expansion of the D9-brane action in a type-I
background. In hep-th/9901055 it was shown that there are two ways of
performing a type-I truncation of the D9-brane action, and the resulting
truncated action was obtained in a flat background. We extend this result to a
generic type-I background, and argue that the two different truncations are in
correspondence with the open sector of the low-energy effective action of the
two different consistent ten-dimensional type-I string theories, namely the
SO(32) superstring and the $USp(32)$ non-supersymmetric string.
