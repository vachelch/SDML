Spectral Universality of Real Chiral Random Matrix Ensembles
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the universality of microscopic eigenvalue correlations for
Random Matrix Theories with the global symmetries of the QCD partition
function. In this article we analyze the case of real valued chiral Random
Matrix Theories ($\beta =1$) by relating the kernel of the correlations
functions for $\beta =1$ to the kernel of chiral Random Matrix Theories with
complex matrix elements ($\beta = 2$), which is already known to be universal.
Our proof is based on a novel asymptotic property of the skew-orthogonal
polynomials: an integral over the corresponding wavefunctions oscillates about
half its asymptotic value in the region of the bulk of the zeros. This result
solves the puzzle that microscopic universality persists in spite of
contributions to the microscopic correlators from the region near the largest
zero of the skew-orthogonal polynomials. Our analytical results are illustrated
by the numerical construction of the skew-orthogonal polynomials for an $x^4$
probability potential.
