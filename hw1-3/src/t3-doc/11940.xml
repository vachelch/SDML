<title>
The heat-kernel and the average effective potential
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the definition of the average effective action in terms of the
heat-kernel. As an example we examine a model describing a self-interacting
scalar field, both in flat and curved background, and study the renormalization
group flow of some of the parameters characterizing its effective potential.
Some implications of the running of these parameters for inflationary cosmology
are also briefly discussed.
