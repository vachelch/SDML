<title>
Trapping of Nonabelian Gauge Fields on a Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that as in abelian gauge fields, nonabelian gauge fields are also
trapped on a brane in the Randall-Sundrum model by applying a new mechanism
based on topological Higgs mechanism. It is pointed out that although almost
massless gauge fields are localized on the brane by the new mechanism, exactly
massless gauge fields are not localized. This fact does not yield any problem
to abelian gauge fields, but may give some problem to nonabelian gauge fields
since it is known that there is a discontinuity between massless and massive
gauge fields in the case of nonabelian gauge groups.
