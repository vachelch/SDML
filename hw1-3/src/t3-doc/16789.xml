<title>
The Supersymmetric Effective Action of the Heterotic String in Ten
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the supersymmetric completion of quartic $R+R^4$-actions in the
ten-dimensional effective action of the heterotic string. Two invariants, of
which the bosonic parts are known from one-loop string amplitude calculations,
are obtained. One of these invariants can be generalized to an
$R+F^2+F^4$-invariant for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory coupled to
supergravity.
  Supersymmetry requires the presence of $B\wedge R\wedge R\wedge
  R\wedge R$-terms, ($B\wedge F\wedge F\wedge F\wedge F$ for
  Yang-Mills) which correspond to counterterms in the Green-Schwarz anomaly
cancellation. Within the context of our calculation the $\zeta(3)R^4$-term from
the tree-level string effective action does not allow supersymmetrization.
