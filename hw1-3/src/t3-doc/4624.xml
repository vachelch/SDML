Conformal boundary and geodesics for $AdS_5\times S^5$ and the plane
  wave: Their approach in the Penrose limit
</title>

<abstract>
  Projecting on a suitable subset of coordinates, a picture is constructed in
which the conformal boundary of $AdS_5\times S^5$ and that of the plane wave
resulting in the Penrose limit are located at the same line. In a second line
of arguments all $AdS_5\times S^5$ and plane wave geodesics are constructed in
their integrated form. Performing the Penrose limit, the approach of null
geodesics reaching the conformal boundary of $AdS_5\times S^5$ to that of the
plane wave is studied in detail. At each point these null geodesics of
$AdS_5\times S^5$ form a cone which degenerates in the limit.
