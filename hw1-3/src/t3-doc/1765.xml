D-branes as GMS Solitons in Vacuum String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we map the D-brane projector states in the vacuum string field
theory to the noncommutative GMS solitons based on the recently proposed map of
Witten's star to Moyal's star. We find that the singular geometry conditions of
Moore and Taylor are associated with the commutative modes of these projector
states in our framework. The properties of the candidate closed string state
and the wedge state are also discussed, and the possibility of the non-GMS
soliton in VSFT is commented.
