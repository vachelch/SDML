<title>
Anharmonic oscillators, the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, and nonlinear
  integral equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The spectral determinant $D(E)$ of the quartic oscillator is known to satisfy
a functional equation. This is mapped onto the $A_3$-related $Y$-system
emerging in the treatment of a certain perturbed conformal field theory,
allowing us to give an alternative integral expression for $D(E)$. Generalising
this result, we conjecture a relationship between the $x^{2M}$ anharmonic
oscillators and the $A_{2M-1}$ TBA systems. Finally, spectral determinants for
general $|x|^{\alpha}$ potentials are mapped onto the solutions of nonlinear
integral equations associated with the (twisted) XXZ and sine-Gordon models.
