Stability, Causality, and Lorentz and CPT Violation
</title>

<abstract>
  Stability and causality are investigated for quantum field theories
incorporating Lorentz and CPT violation. Explicit calculations in the quadratic
sector of a general renormalizable lagrangian for a massive fermion reveal that
no difficulty arises for low energies if the parameters controlling the
breaking are small, but for high energies either energy positivity or
microcausality is violated in some observer frame. However, this can be avoided
if the lagrangian is the sub-Planck limit of a nonlocal theory with spontaneous
Lorentz and CPT violation. Our analysis supports the stability and causality of
the Lorentz- and CPT-violating standard-model extension that would emerge at
low energies from spontaneous breaking in a realistic string theory.
