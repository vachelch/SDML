<title>
The Relation Between KMS-states for Different Temperatures
</title>

<abstract>
  Given a thermal field theory for a certain temperature, we present a method
to construct the theory at any finite positive temperature provided the number
of local degrees of freedom is restricted in a physically sensible manner. Our
work is based on a construction invented by Buchholz and Junglas [BJu 89].
Starting from the vacuum representation, they established the existence of
thermal equilibrium states (KMS-states) for a large class of quantum field
theories. The KMS-states were constructed as limit points of nets of states
which represented strictly localized excitations of the vacuum. We adjust their
method to the general structure of thermal quantum field theories. In a first
step we construct states which closely resemble KMS-states for the new
temperature in a local region $\O_\circ \subset \r^4$, but coincide with the
given KMS-state in the space-like complement of a slightly larger region
$\hat{\O}$. By a weak^*-compactness argument there always exists a convergent
subsequence of states as the size of $\O_\circ$ and $\hat{\O}$ tends towards
$\r^4$. Whether or not the limit state of such a subsequence is a global
KMS-states for the new temperature, depends on the surface energy contained in
the layer in between the boundaries of $\O_\circ^{(i)}$ and $\hat{\O}^{(i)}$ as
$i \to \infty$. This surface energy is controlled by a generalized cluster
theorem.
