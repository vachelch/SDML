Quantum Mechanics Violating Effects to Masses of Nambu-Goldstone Bosons:
  A Lesson for Majoron
</title>

<abstract>
  We study gravitational quantum mechanics violating (QMV) effects to masses of
Nambu-Goldstone bosons, taking majoron as an example. We show a supersymmetric
majoron has either mass of O(keV) for the dimension five potential or smaller
mass for effective potentials with higher dimensions. We extend the Dashen's
formula for pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons to include possible effects of QMV.
