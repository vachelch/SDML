Event horizon - Magnifying glass for Planck length physics
</title>

<abstract>
  An attempt is made to describe the `thermodynamics' of semiclassical
spacetime without specifying the detailed `molecular structure' of the quantum
spacetime, using the known properties of blackholes. I give detailed arguments,
essentially based on the behaviour of quantum systems near the event horizon,
which suggest that event horizon acts as a magnifying glass to probe Planck
length physics even in those contexts in which the spacetime curvature is
arbitrarily low. The quantum state describing a blackhole, in any microscopic
description of spacetime, has to possess certain universal form of density of
states which can be ascertained from general considerations. Since a blackhole
can be formed from the collapse of any physical system with a low energy
Hamiltonian H, it is suggested that when such a system collapses to form a
blackhole, it should be described by a modified Hamiltonian of the form
$H^2_{\rm mod} =A^2 \ln (1+ H^2/A^2)$ where $A^2 \propto E_P^2$.I also show
that it is possible to construct several physical systems which have the
blackhole density of states and hence will be indistinguishable from a
blackhole as far as thermodynamic interactions are concerned. In particular,
blackholes can be thought of as one-particle excitations of a class of {\it
nonlocal} field theories with the thermodynamics of blackholes arising
essentially from the asymptotic form of the dispersion relation satisfied by
these excitations. These field theoretic models have correlation functions with
a universal short distance behaviour, which translates into the generic
behaviour of semiclassical blackholes. Several implications of this paradigm
are discussed.
