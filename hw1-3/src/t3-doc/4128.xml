<title>
Dynamical generation of gauge and Higgs bosons in N=2 supersymmetric
  non-linear sigma-models
</title>

<abstract>
  A four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma-model with the
Eguchi-Hanson (ALE) target space and a non-vanishing central charge is
rewritten to a classically equivalent and formally renormalizable gauged
`linear' sigma-model over a non-compact coset space in N=2 harmonic superspace
by making use of an N=2 vector gauge superfield as the Lagrange multiplier. It
is then demonstrated that the N=2 vector gauge multiplet becomes dynamical
after taking into account one-loop corrections due to quantized
hypermultiplets. This implies the appearance of a composite gauge boson, a
composite chiral spinor doublet and a composite complex Higgs particle, all
defined as the physical states associated with the propagating N=2 vector gauge
superfield. The composite N=2 vector multiplet is further identified with the
zero modes of a superstring ending on a D-6-brane. Some non-perturbative
phenomena, such as the gauge symmetry enhancement for coincident D-6-branes and
the Maldacena conjecture, turn out to be closely related to our NLSM via
M-theory. Our results support a conjecture about the composite nature of
superstrings ending on D-branes.
