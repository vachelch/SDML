O(3) Sigma model with Hopf term on Fuzzy Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate the $O(3) \s-$ model on fuzzy sphere and construct the Hopf
term. We show that the field can be expanded in terms of the ladder operators
of Holstein-Primakoff realisation of SU(2) algebra and the corresponding basis
set can be classified into different topological sectors by the magnetic
quantum numbers. We obtain topological charge $Q$ and show that $-2j\le Q
\le2j$. We also construct BPS solitons. Using the covariantly conserved
current, we construct the Hopf term and show that its value is $Q^2$ as in the
commutative case. We also point out the interesting relation of physical space
to deformed SU(2) algebra.
