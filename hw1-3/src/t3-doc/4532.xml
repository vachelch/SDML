<title>
Non-local string theories on AdS_3 times S^3 and stable
  non-supersymmetric backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We exhibit a simple class of exactly marginal "double-trace" deformations of
two dimensional CFTs which have AdS_3 duals, in which the deformation is given
by a product of left and right-moving U(1) currents. In this special case the
deformation on AdS_3 is generated by a local boundary term in three dimensions,
which changes the physics also in the bulk via bulk-boundary propagators.
However, the deformation is non-local in six dimensions and on the string
worldsheet, like generic non-local string theories (NLSTs). Due to the
simplicity of the deformation we can explicitly make computations in the
non-local string theory and compare them to CFT computations, and we obtain
precise agreement. We discuss the effect of the deformation on closed strings
and on D-branes. The examples we analyze include a supersymmetry-breaking but
exactly marginal "double-trace" deformation, which is dual to a string theory
in which no destabilizing tadpoles are generated for moduli nonperturbatively
in all couplings, despite the absence of supersymmetry. We explain how this
cancellation works on the gravity side in string perturbation theory, and also
non-perturbatively at leading order in the deformation parameter. We also
discuss possible flat space limits of our construction.
