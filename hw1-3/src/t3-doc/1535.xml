<title>
Complex Paths and Covariance of Hawking Radiation in 2D Stringy Black
  Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Hawking radiation is computed in different coordinate systems using the
method of complex paths. In this procedure the event horizon of the 2D
Schwarzschild stringy black hole is treated as a singularity for the
semiclassical action functional. After the regularization of the event
horizon's singularity the emission/absorption probabilities and the Hawking
temperature in the different coordinate representations are derived. The
identical results obtained indicate the covariance of the Hawking radiation.
