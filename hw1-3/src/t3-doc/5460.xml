<title>
Stress-Energy Tensors for Higher Dimensional Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate, in the context of higher dimensional gravity, the stress-energy
tensor and Weyl anomaly associated with anti-de Sitter and anti-de Sitter black
hole solutions. The boundary counter-term method is used to regularize the
action and the resulting stress-energy tensor yields both the correct black
hole energies as well as a vacuum energy contribution which is interpreted as a
Casimir energy. This calculation is done up to d = 8 (d being the boundary
dimension). We confirm some results for d < 8 as well as comment on some new
results (some of which are relevant to (2,0) theory). All results for d=8 are
new.
