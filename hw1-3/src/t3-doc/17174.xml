An Algebraic Criterion for the Ultraviolet Finiteness of Quantum Field
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  An algebraic criterion for the vanishing of the beta function for
renormalizable quantum field theories is presented. Use is made of the descent
equations following from the Wess-Zumino consistency condition. In some cases,
these equations relate the fully quantized action to a local gauge invariant
polynomial. The vanishing of the anomalous dimension of this polynomial enables
us to establish a nonrenormalization theorem for the beta function $\beta_g$,
stating that if the one-loop order contribution vanishes, then $\beta_g$ will
vanish to all orders of perturbation theory. As a by-product, the special case
in which $\beta_g$ is only of one-loop order, without further corrections, is
also covered. The examples of the N=2,4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are
worked out in detail.
