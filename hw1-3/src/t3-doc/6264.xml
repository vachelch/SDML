<title>
Abelian Higgs Hair for Electrically Charged Dilaton Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that an electronically charged dilaton black hole can support a
long range field of a Nielsen-Olesen string. Combining both numerical and
perturbative techniques we examine the properties of an Abelian-Higgs vortex in
the presence of the black hole under consideration. Allowing the black hole to
approach extremality we found that all fields of the vortex are expelled from
the extreme black hole. In the thin string limit we obtained the metric of a
conical electrically charged dilaton black hole. The effect of the vortex can
be measured from infinity justifying its characterization as black hole hair.
