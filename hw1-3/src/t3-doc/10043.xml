Quantum Integrability of Certain Boundary Conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the quantum integrability of the O(N) nonlinear $\sigma$ (nls) model
and the O(N) Gross-Neveu (GN) model on the half-line. We show that the \nls
model is integrable with Neumann, Dirichlet and a mixed boundary condition, and
that the GN model is integrable if $\psi_+^a\x=\pm\psi_-^a\x$. We also comment
on the boundary condition found by Corrigan and Sheng for the O(3) nls model.
