Supercoherent States of OSp(8*|2N), Conformal Superfields and the
  AdS_7/CFT_6 Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the positive energy unitary representations of 2N extended
superconformal algebras OSp(8*|2N) in six dimensions. These representations can
be formulated in a particle basis or a supercoherent state basis, which are
labeled by the superspace coordinates in d=6. We show that the supercoherent
states that form the bases of positive energy representations of OSp(8*|2N) can
be identified with conformal superfields in six dimensions. The massless
conformal superfields correspond precisely to the ultra short doubleton
supermultiplets of OSp(8*|2N). The other positive energy unitary
representations correspond to massive conformal superfields in six dimensions
and they can be obtained by tensoring an arbitrary number of doubleton
supermultiplets with each other. The supermultiplets obtained by tensoring two
copies of the doubletons correspond to massless anti-de Sitter supermultiplets
in d = 7.
