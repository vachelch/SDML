<title>
Anti-symmetric Tensor Matter Fields and Non-Linear Sigma-Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The equivalence between rank-2 anti-symmetric tensor fields, considered as
gauge potentials, and torsionless non-linear $\sigma$-models suggests us to
study the possibility of coupling tensorial matter with Yang-Mills fields,
through the gauging of the isometries of the target space. We show that this
coupling is actually possible; however, the matter appears no longer as an
elementary field, but rather as a composite one, expressed in terms of the
bosonic degrees of freedom of the $\sigma$-model. A possible phenomenological
application is presented that describes the interactions among vector mesons in
terms of the geometrical properties of the target manifold. Also, spin-2 meson
resonances may naturally be accommodated whenever the $\sigma$-model's target
manifold is non-symmetric.
