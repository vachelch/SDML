<title>
Multicomponent WKB and Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  Hamiltonians whose symbols are not simply real valued, but matrix or, more
generally, endomorphism valued functions appear in many places in physics,
examples being the Dirac equation, multicomponent wave equations like
electrodynamics in media, and Yang-Mills theories, and the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation in molecular physics. The aim of this paper is to give a
completely geometric approach to the WKB approximation od such systems, and to
reduce the problem ``as far as possible'' to the scalar case. A star-product
formulation of quantum mechanics proves to be particularly useful in this
context. As opposed to other approaches in the literature which restrict
themselves to the use of the Moyal product and thus to the study of trivial
bundles (or local trivializations) over $\real^{2n}$, we will consider general
bundles over arbitrary symplectic manifolds. Here, Fedosov's construction
\cite{fedosov} will be the adequate tool, since it gives an explicit
construction for star products in this general setting.
