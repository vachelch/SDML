<title>
Effective potential and stability of the rigid membrane
</title>

<abstract>
  The calculation of the effective potential for fixed-end and toroidal rigid
$p$-branes is performed in the one-loop as well as in the $1/d$ approximations.
The analysis of the involved zeta-functions (of inhomogeneous Epstein type)
which appear in the process of regularization is done in full detail.
Assymptotic formulas (allowing only for exponentially decreasing errors of
order $\leq 10^{-3}$) are found which carry all the dependences on the basic
parameters of the theory explicitly. The behaviour of the effective potential
(specified to the membrane case $p=2$) is investigated, and the extrema of this
effective potential are obtained.
