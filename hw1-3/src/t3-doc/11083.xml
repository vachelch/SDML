<title>
Black Holes and Solitons in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this review I discuss various aspects of some of the recently constructed
black hole and soliton solutions in string theory. I begin with the axionic
instanton and related solutions of bosonic and heterotic string theory. The
latter ten-dimensional solutions can be compactified to supersymmetric
monopole, string and domain wall solutions which break $1/2$ of the spacetime
supersymmetries of $N=4, D=4$ heterotic string theory, and which can be
generalized to two-parameter charged black hole solutions. The low-energy
dynamics of these solutions is also discussed, as well as their connections
with strong/weak coupling duality and target space duality in string theory.
Finally, new solutions are presented which break $3/4, 7/8$ and all of the
spacetime supersymmetries and which also arise in more realistic $N=1$ and
$N=2$ compactifications.
