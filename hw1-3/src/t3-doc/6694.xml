<title>
Heat-kernel coefficients of the Laplace operator on the D-dimensional
  ball
</title>

<abstract>
We present a very quick and powerful method for the calculation of heat-kernel
coefficients. It makes use of rather common ideas, as integral representations
of the spectral sum, Mellin transforms, non-trivial commutation of series and
integrals and skilful analytic continuation of zeta functions on the complex
plane. We apply our method to the case of the heat-kernel expansion of the
Laplace operator on a $D$-dimensional ball with either Dirichlet, Neumann or,
in general, Robin boundary conditions. The final formulas are quite simple.
Using this case as an example, we illustrate in detail our scheme ---which
serves for the calculation of an (in principle) arbitrary number of heat-kernel
coefficients in any situation when the basis functions are known. We provide a
complete list of new results for the coefficients $B_3,...,B_{10}$,
corresponding to the $D$-dimensional ball with all the mentioned boundary
conditions and $D=3,4,5$.
