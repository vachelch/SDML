Bosonization and Duality in Arbitrary Dimensions: New Results
</title>

<abstract>
  A generic massive Thirring Model in three space-time dimensions exhibits a
correspondence with a topologically massive bosonized gauge action associated
to a self-duality constraint, and we write down a general expression for this
relationship.
  We also generalize this structure to $d$ dimensions, by adopting the
so-called doublet approach, recently introduced. In particular, a non-
conventional formulation of the bosonization technique in higher dimensions (in
the spirit of $d=3$), is proposed and, as an application, we show how fermionic
(Thirring-like) representations for bosonic topologically massive models in
four dimensions may be built up.
