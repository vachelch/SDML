<title>
On spin-1 massive particles coupled to a Chern-Simons field
</title>

<abstract>
  We study spin one particles interacting through a Chern-Simons field. In the
Born approximation, we calculate the two body scattering amplitude considering
three possible ways to introduce the interaction: (a) a Proca like model
minimally coupled to a Chern-Simons field, (b) the model obtained from (a) by
replacing the Proca's mass by a Chern-Simons term and (c) a complex
Maxwell-Chern-Simons model minimally coupled to a Chern-Simons field. In the
low energy regime the results show similarities with the Aharonov-Bohm
scattering for spin 1/2 particles. We discuss the one loop renormalization
program for the Proca's model. In spite of the bad ultraviolet behavior of the
matter field propagator, we show that, up to one loop the model is power
counting renormalizable thanks to the Ward identities satisfied by the
interaction vertices.
