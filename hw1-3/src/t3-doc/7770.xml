<title>
Euclidean and Canonical Formulations of Statistical Mechanics in the
  Presence of Killing Horizons
</title>

<abstract>
  The relation between the covariant Euclidean free-energy $F^E$ and the
canonical statistical-mechanical free energy $F^C$ in the presence of the
Killing horizons is studied. $F^E$ is determined by the covariant Euclidean
effective action. The definition of $F^C$ is related to the Hamiltonian which
is the generator of the evolution along the Killing time. At arbitrary
temperatures $F^E$ acquires additional ultraviolet divergences because of
conical singularities. The divergences of $F^C$ are different and occur since
the density ${dn \over d\omega}$ of the energy levels of the system blows up
near the horizon in an infrared way. We show that there are regularizations
that make it possible to remove the infrared cutoff in ${dn \over d\omega}$.
After that the divergences of $F^C$ become identical to the divergences of
$F^E$. The latter property turns out to be crucial to reconcile the covariant
Euclidean and the canonical formulations of the theory. The method we use is
new and is based on a relation between ${dn \over d\omega}$ and heat kernels on
hyperbolic-like spaces. Our analysis includes spin 0 and spin 1/2 fields on
arbitrary backgrounds. For these fields the divergences of ${dn \over
d\omega}$, $F^C$ and $F^E$ are presented in the most complete form.
