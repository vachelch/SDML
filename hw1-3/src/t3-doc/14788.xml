<title>
A Gravity Dual of the Chiral Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  We study effects associated with the chiral anomaly for a cascading
$SU(N+M)\times SU(N)$ gauge theory using gauge/gravity duality. In the gravity
dual the anomaly is a classical feature of the supergravity solution, and the
breaking of the U(1) R-symmetry down to ${\bf Z}_{2M}$ proceeds via the Higgs
mechanism.
