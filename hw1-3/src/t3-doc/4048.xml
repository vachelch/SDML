Calculating Gluino-Condensate Prepotential
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the derivation of the CIV-DV prepotential for arbitrary power n+1
of the original superpotential in the N=1 SUSY YM theory (for arbitrary number
n of cuts in the solution of the planar matrix model in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa
interpretation). The goal is to hunt for structures, not so much for exact
formulas, which are necessarily complicated, before the right language is found
to represent them. Some entities, reminiscent of representation theory, clearly
emerge, but a lot of work remains to be done to identify the relevant ones. As
a practical application, we obtain a cubic (first non-perturbative)
contribution to the prepotential for any n.
