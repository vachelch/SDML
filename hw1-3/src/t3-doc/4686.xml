Boundary Fluctuations of AdS String
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the world-sheet perturbations of string theory formulated around
$AdS_3$ background. We identify a set of operators that, while added to the
world-sheet action, generate the boundary fluctuations of $AdS_3$. The effect
of these operators can be collectively defined in terms of Liouville field
living on the $AdS_3$ boundary. We then study various deformations of $AdS_3$
generated by boundary fluctuations by turning on suitable world-sheet
couplings. We also discuss certain small fluctuations around the BTZ black
hole.
