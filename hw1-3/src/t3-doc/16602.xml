[SU(5)]^3 SUSY unification
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present paper we demonstrate the possibility of the [SUSY(5)]^3 SUSY
unification at the energy scale $\mu_{GUT}\approx 10^{18.3} GeV$ with the value
of GUT inverse finestructure constant $\alpha_{GUT}^{-1}\approx 34.4$, which is
very close to its critical value $\alpha_{5, crit}^{-1}\approx 34.0$, existing
at the Planck scale.
