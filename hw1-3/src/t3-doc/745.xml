<title>
Eikonal Quantum Gravity and Planckian Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  Various approaches to high energy forward scattering in quantum gravity are
compared using the eikonal approximation. The massless limit of the eikonal is
shown to be equivalent to other approximations for the same process,
specifically the semiclassical calculation due to G. 't Hooft and the
topological field theory due to H. and E. Verlinde. This comparison clarifies
these previous results, as it is seen that the amplitude arises purely from a
linearised gravitational interaction. The interpretation of poles in the
scattering amplitude is also clarified.
