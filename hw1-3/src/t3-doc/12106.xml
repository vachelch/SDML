<title>
Functional Evolution of Free Quantum Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the problem of evolving a quantum field between any two (in
general, curved) Cauchy surfaces. Classically, this dynamical evolution is
represented by a canonical transformation on the phase space for the field
theory. We show that this canonical transformation cannot, in general, be
unitarily implemented on the Fock space for free quantum fields on flat
spacetimes of dimension greater than 2. We do this by considering time
evolution of a free Klein-Gordon field on a flat spacetime (with toroidal
Cauchy surfaces) starting from a flat initial surface and ending on a generic
final surface. The associated Bogolubov transformation is computed; it does not
correspond to a unitary transformation on the Fock space. This means that
functional evolution of the quantum state as originally envisioned by Tomonaga,
Schwinger, and Dirac is not a viable concept. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that
functional evolution of the quantum state can be satisfactorily described using
the formalism of algebraic quantum field theory. We discuss possible
implications of our results for canonical quantum gravity.
