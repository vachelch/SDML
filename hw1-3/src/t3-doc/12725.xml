<title>
Vacuum Structure and $\theta$ States of Adjoint QCD in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We address the issue of topological angles in the context of two dimensional
SU(N) Yang-Mills theory coupled to massive fermions in the adjoint
representation. Classification of the resulting multiplicity of vacua is
carried outin terms of asymptotic fundamental Wilson loops, or equivalently,
charges at the boundary of the world. We explicitly demonstrate that the
multiplicity of vacuum states is equal to N for SU(N) gauge group. Different
worlds of the theory are classified by the integer number k=0,1,...N-1
(superselection rules) which plays an analogous role to the $\theta$ parameter
in QCD. Via two completely independent approaches we study the physical
properties of these unconnected worlds as a function of k. First, we apply the
well known machinery of the loop calculus in order to calculate the effective
string tensions in the theory as function of $k$. The second way of doing the
same physics is the standard particle/field theoretic calculation for the
binding potential of a pair of infinitely massive fermions. We also calculate
the vacuum energy as function of k.
