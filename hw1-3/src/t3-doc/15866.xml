Finite-Element Lattice Hamiltonian Matrix Eleents. Anharmonic
  Oscillators
</title>

<abstract>
The finite-element approach to lattice field theory is both highly accurate
(relative errors $\sim 1/N^2$, where $N$ is the number of lattice points) and
exactly unitary (in the sense that canonical commutation relations are exactly
preserved at the lattice sites). In this paper we construct matrix elements for
the time evolution operator for the anharmonic oscillator, for which the
continuum Hamiltonian is $H=p^2/2+\lambda q^{2k}/2k$. Construction of such
matrix elements does not require solving the implicit equations of motion. Low
order approximations turn out to be quite accurate. For example, the matrix
element of the time evolution operator in the harmonic oscillator ground state
gives a result for the $k=2$ anharmonic oscillator ground state energy accurate
to better than 1\%, while a two-state approximation reduces the error to less
than 0.1\%. Accurate wavefunctions are also extracted. Analogous results may be
obtained in the continuum, but there the computation is more difficult, and not
generalizable to field theories in more dimensions.
