QCD2-Screening, Confinement and Novel non-abelian Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the question of screening versus confinement in bosonized massless
QCD in two dimensions. We deduce the screening behavior of massless $SU(N_c)$
QCD with flavored fundamental fermions and fermions in the adjoint
representation. This is done by computing the potential between external quarks
as well as by bosonizing also the external sources and analyzing the states of
the combined system. We write down novel "non-abelian Schwinger like" solutions
of the equations of motion, compute their masses and argue that an exchange of
massive modes of this type is associated with the screening mechanism.
