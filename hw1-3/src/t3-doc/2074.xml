Interacting Charged Particles in an Electric Field and the Unruh Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the transition amplitudes between charged particles of mass $M$
and $m$ accelerated by a constant electric field and interacting by the
exchange of quanta of a third field. We work in second quantization in order to
take into account both recoil effects induced by transitions and the vacuum
instability of the charged fields. In spite of both effects, when the exchanged
particle is neutral, the equilibrium ratio of the populations is simply
$\exp(\pi (M^2 - m^2)/eE)$. Thus, in the limit $(M-m)/M \to 0$, one recovers
Unruh's result characterized by the temperature $a/2\pi$ where $a$ is the
acceleration. When the exchanged particle is charged, its vacuum instability
prevents a simple description of the equilibrium state. However, in the limit
wherein the charge of the exchanged particle tends to zero, the equilibrium
distribution is once more Boltzmanian, but characterized not only by a
temperature but also by the electric potential felt by the exchanged particle.
This work therefore confirms that thermodynamics in the presence of horizons
does not rely on a semi-classical treatment. The relationship with
thermodymanics of charged black holes is stressed.
