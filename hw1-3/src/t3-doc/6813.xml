A Generic Renormalization Method in Curved Spaces and at Finite
  Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  Based only on simple principles of renormalization in coordinate space, we
derive closed renormalized amplitudes and renormalization group constants at 1-
and 2-loop orders for scalar field theories in general backgrounds. This is
achieved through a generic renormalization procedure we develop exploiting the
central idea behind differential renormalization, which needs as only inputs
the propagator and the appropriate laplacian for the backgrounds in question.
We work out this generic coordinate space renormalization in some detail, and
subsequently back it up with specific calculations for scalar theories both on
curved backgrounds, manifestly preserving diffeomorphism invariance, and at
finite temperature.
