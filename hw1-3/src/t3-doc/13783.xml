Asymmetric Orbifolds, Noncommutative Geometry and Type I String Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the D-brane contents of asymmetric orbifolds. Using T-duality
we find that the consistent description of open strings in asymmetric orbifolds
requires to turn on background gauge fields on the D-branes. We derive the
corresponding noncommutative geometry arising on such D-branes with mixed
Neumann-Dirichlet boundary conditions directly by applying an asymmetric
rotation to open strings with pure Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. As
a concrete application of our results we construct asymmetric type I vacua
requiring open strings with mixed boundary conditions for tadpole cancellation.
