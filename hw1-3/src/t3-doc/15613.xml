<title>
Skyrmions and domain walls in (2+1) dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study classical solutions of the vector O(3) sigma model in (2+1)
dimensions, spontaneously broken to O(2)xZ2. The model possesses Skyrmion-type
solutions as well as stable domain walls which connect different vacua. We show
that different types of waves can propagate on the wall, including waves
carrying a topological charge. The domain wall can also absorb Skyrmions and,
under appropriate initial conditions, it is possible to emit a Skyrmion from
the wall.
