Open supermembranes in eleven dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider open supermembranes in an eleven dimensional background. We show
that, in a flat space-time, the world-volume action is kappa-symmetric and has
global space-time supersymmetry if space-time has even dimensional topological
defects where the membrane can end. An example of such topological defects is
provided by the space-time with boundaries considered by Horava and Witten. In
that case the world-volume action has reparametrisation anomalies whose
cancellation requires the inclusion of a current algebra on the boundaries of
the membrane. The role of kappa-anomalies in a general background is discussed.
The tension of the membrane is related to the eleven dimensional gravitational
constant with the aid of the Green-Schwarz mechanism allowing a consistency
check of M-theory.
