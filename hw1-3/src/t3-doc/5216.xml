<title>
Localised Gravity in the Singular Domain Wall Background?
</title>

<abstract>
  We study singular, supersymmetric domain-wall solutions supported by the
massive breathing mode scalars of, for example, sphere reductions in M-theory
or string theory. The space-time on one side of such a wall is asymptotic to
the Cauchy horizon of the anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. However, on the
other side there is a naked singularity. The higher-dimensional embedding of
these solutions has the novel interpretation of (sphere compactified) brane
configurations in the domain ``inside the horizon region,'' with the
singularity corresponding to the sphere shrinking to zero volume. The naked
singularity is the source of an infinite attractive gravitational potential for
the fluctuating modes. Nevertheless, the spectrum is bounded from below,
continuous and positive definite, with the wave functions suppressed in the
region close to the singularity. The massless bound state is formally excluded
due to the boundary condition for the fluctuating mode wave functions at the
naked singularity. However, a regularisation of the naked singularity, for
example by effects of the order of the inverse string scale, in turn
regularises the gravitational potential and allows for precisely one (massless)
bound-state spin-2 fluctuating mode. We also contrast spectra in these domain
wall backgrounds with those of the domain walls due to the massless modes of
sphere reductions.
