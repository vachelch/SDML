Multiparameter Integrable QFT's with N bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a new family of integrable theories with $N$ bosons and $N$
freely adjustable mass parameters. These theories restrict in particular limits
to the ``generalized supersymmetric'' sine-Gordon models, as well as to the
flavor anisotropic chiral Gross Neveu models (studied recently by N. Andrei and
collaborators). The scattering theory involves scalar particles that are no
bound states, and bears an intriguing resemblance wih the results of a sharp
cut-off analysis of the Thirring model carried out by Korepin in (1980).
Various physical applications are discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that
our theories are the appropriate continuum limit of integrable quantum spin
chains with mixtures of spins.
