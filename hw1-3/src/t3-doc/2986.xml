Index Theory, Gerbes, and Hamiltonian Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theory construction of the bundle of
fermionic Fock spaces parametrized by vector potentials in odd space dimensions
and prove that this leads in a simple manner to the known Schwinger terms
(Faddeev-Mickelsson cocycle) for the gauge group action. We relate the APS
construction to the bundle gerbe approach discussed recently by Carey and
Murray, including an explicit computation of the Dixmier-Douady class. An
advantage of our method is that it can be applied whenever one has a form of
the APS theorem at hand, as in the case of fermions in an external
gravitational field.
