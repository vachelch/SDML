<title>
Exploring the second class constraint quantization approach proposed by
  Batalin and Marnelius
</title>

<abstract>
  I extend upon the paper by Batalin and Marnelius, in which they show how to
construct and quantize a gauge theory from a Hamiltonian system with second
class constraints. Among the avenues explored, their technique is analyzed in
relation to other well-known methods of quantization and a bracket is defined,
such that the operator formalism can be fully developed. I also extend to
systems with mixed class constraints and look at some simple examples.
