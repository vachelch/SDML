<title>
Conformal Invariance and Duality in Self-Dual Gravity and (2,1)
  Heterotic String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A system of gravity coupled to a 2-form gauge field, a dilaton and Yang-Mills
fields in $2n$ dimensions arises from the (2,1) sigma model or string. The
field equations imply that the curvature with torsion and Yang-Mills field
strength are self-dual in four dimensions, or satisfy generalised self-duality
equations in $2n$ dimensions. The Born-Infeld-type action describing this
system is simplified using an auxiliary metric and shown to be classically Weyl
invariant only in four dimensions. A dual form of the action is found (no
isometries are required). In four dimensions, the dual geometry is self-dual
gravity without torsion coupled to a scalar field. In $D>4$ dimensions, the
dual geometry is hermitian and determined by a $D-4$ form potential $K$,
generalising the K\"{a}hler potential of the four dimensional case, with the
fundamental 2-form given by $\tilde J= i*\partial \bar \partial K$. The
coupling to Yang-Mills is through a term $K\wedge tr (F\wedge F)$ and leads to
a Uhlenbeck-Yau field equation $\tilde J^{ij}F_{ij}=0$.
