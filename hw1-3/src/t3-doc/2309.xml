<title>
BRST QUANTIZATION OF NON-ABELIAN BF TOPOLOGICAL THEORIES
</title>

<abstract>
The off-shell nilpotent BRST charge and the BRST invariant effective action for
non-abelian BF topological theories over D-dimensional manifolds are explicitly
constructed. These theories have the feature of being reducible with exactly
D-3 stages of reducibility. The adequate extended phase space including the
different levels of ghosts for ghosts is explicitly obtained. Using the
structure of the resulting BRST charge we show that for topological BF theories
the semi-classical approximation completely describes the quantum theory. The
independence of the partition function on the metric also follows from our
explicit construction in a straightforward way.
