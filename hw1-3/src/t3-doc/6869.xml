<title>
D3-branes on partial resolutions of abelian quotient singularities of
  Calabi-Yau threefolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate field theories on the worldvolume of a D3-brane transverse to
partial resolutions of a $\Z_3\times\Z_3$ Calabi-Yau threefold quotient
singularity. We deduce the field content and lagrangian of such theories and
present a systematic method for mapping the moment map levels characterizing
the partial resolutions of the singularity to the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters
of the D-brane worldvolume theory. As opposed to the simpler cases studied
before, we find a complex web of partial resolutions and associated
field-theoretic Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations. The analysis is performed by
toric methods, leading to a structure which can be efficiently described in the
language of convex geometry. For the worldvolume theory, the analysis of the
moduli space has an elegant description in terms of quivers. As a by-product,
we present a systematic way of extracting the birational geometry of the
classical moduli spaces, thus generalizing previous work on resolution of
singularities by D-branes.
