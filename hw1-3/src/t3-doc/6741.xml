Quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor in A2(1) Toda
  Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The $O(\beta^2)$ quantum correction to the classical reflection factor is
calculated for one of the integrable boundary conditions of $a_2^{(1)}$ affine
Toda field theory. This is found to agree with the conjectured exact reflection
factor of the quantum theory. We consider the existence of other exact
reflection factors consistent with our perturbative answer and examine the
question of how duality transformations might relate theories with different
boundary conditions.
