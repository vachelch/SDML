Negative Energy Densities in Quantum Field Theory With a Background
  Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a general procedure for calculating one-loop ``Casimir'' energy
densities for a scalar field coupled to a fixed potential in renormalized
quantum field theory. We implement direct subtraction of counterterms computed
precisely in dimensional regularization with a definite renormalization scheme.
Our procedure allows us to test quantum field theory energy conditions in the
presence of background potentials spherically symmetric in some dimensions and
independent of others. We explicitly calculate the energy density for several
examples. For a square barrier, we find that the energy is negative and
divergent outside the barrier, but there is a compensating divergent positive
contribution near the barrier on the inside. We also carry out calculations
with exactly solvable $\sech^2$ potentials, which arise in the study of
solitons and domain walls.
