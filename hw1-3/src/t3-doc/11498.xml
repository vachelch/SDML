Adding flavor to Dijkgraaf-Vafa
</title>

<abstract>
  We study matrix models related via the correspondence of Dijkgraaf and Vafa
to supersymmetric gauge theories with matter in the fundamental. As in
flavorless examples, measure factors of the matrix integral reproduce
information about R-symmetry violation in the field theory. The models, studied
previously as models of open strings, exhibit a large-M phase transition as the
number of flavors is varied. This is the matrix model's manifestation of the
end of asymptotic freedom. Using the relation to a quiver gauge theory, we
extract the effective glueball superpotential and Seiberg-Witten curve from the
matrix model.
