Holography and trace anomaly: what is the fate of (brane-world) black
  holes?
</title>

<abstract>
  The holographic principle relates (classical) gravitational waves in the bulk
to quantum fluctuations and the Weyl anomaly of a conformal field theory on the
boundary (the brane). One can thus argue that linear perturbations in the bulk
of static black holes located on the brane be related to the Hawking flux and
that (brane-world) black holes are therefore unstable. We try to gain some
information on such instability from established knowledge of the Hawking
radiation on the brane. In this context, the well-known trace anomaly is used
as a measure of both the validity of the holographic picture and of the
instability for several proposed static brane metrics. In light of the above
analysis, we finally consider a time-dependent metric as the (approximate)
representation of the late stage of evaporating black holes which is
characterized by decreasing Hawking temperature, in qualitative agreement with
what is required by energy conservation.
