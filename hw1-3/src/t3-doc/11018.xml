What is the gravity dual of a chiral primary?
</title>

<abstract>
  In the AdS/CFT correspondence a chiral primary is described by a supergravity
solution with mass equaling angular momentum. For AdS_3 X S^3 we are led to
consider three special families of metrics with this property: metrics with
conical defects, Aichelburg-Sexl type metrics generated by rotating particles,
and metrics generated by giant gravitons. We find that the first two of these
are special cases of the complete family of chiral primary metrics which can be
written down using the general solution in hep-th/0109154, but they correspond
to two extreme limits - the conical defect metrics map to CFT states generated
by twist operators that are all identical, while the Aichelburg-Sexl metrics
yield a wide dispersion in the orders of these twists. The giant graviton
solutions in contrast do not represent configurations of the D1-D5 bound state;
they correspond to fragmenting this system into two or more pieces. We look at
the large distance behavior of the supergravity fields and observe that the
excitation of these fields is linked to the existence of dispersion in the
orders and spins of the twist operators creating the chiral primary in the CFT.
