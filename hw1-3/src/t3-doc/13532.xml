Not a prescription but an identity: Mandelstam-Leibbrandt
</title>

<abstract>
  After some considerations and coincidences that appear when working in the
light-cone gauge, in both the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription and the
covariantization method, we suspect that there must be some connection between
them. This work shows that we were right and it is practically trivial to
demonstrate that relationship. And since the covariantization method is not a
prescription, this implies that the results of Mandelstam and Leibbrandt are
not prescriptions too, but they are a identities from light-cone gauge
coordinates.
