On the Zero-Point Energy of a Conducting Spherical Shell
</title>

<abstract>
  The zero-point energy of a conducting spherical shell is evaluated by
imposing boundary conditions on the potential, and on the ghost fields. The
scheme requires that temporal and tangential components of perturbations of the
potential should vanish at the boundary, jointly with the gauge-averaging
functional, first chosen of the Lorenz type. Gauge invariance of such boundary
conditions is then obtained provided that the ghost fields vanish at the
boundary. Normal and longitudinal modes of the potential obey an entangled
system of eigenvalue equations, whose solution is a linear combination of
Bessel functions under the above assumptions, and with the help of the Feynman
choice for a dimensionless gauge parameter. Interestingly, ghost modes cancel
exactly the contribution to the Casimir energy resulting from transverse and
temporal modes of the potential, jointly with the decoupled normal mode of the
potential. Moreover, normal and longitudinal components of the potential for
the interior and the exterior problem give a result in complete agreement with
the one first found by Boyer, who studied instead boundary conditions involving
TE and TM modes of the electromagnetic field. The coupled eigenvalue equations
for perturbative modes of the potential are also analyzed in the axial gauge,
and for arbitrary values of the gauge parameter. The set of modes which
contribute to the Casimir energy is then drastically changed, and comparison
with the case of a flat boundary sheds some light on the key features of the
Casimir energy in non-covariant gauges.
