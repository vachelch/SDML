Stability of AdS_p x M_q Compactifications Without Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the stability of Freund-Rubin compactifications, AdS_p x M_q, of
p+q-dimensional gravity theories with a q-form field strength and no
cosmological term. We show that the general AdS_p x S^q vacuum is classically
stable against small fluctuations, in the sense that all modes satisfy the
Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. In particular, the compactifications used in the
recent discussion of the proposed bosonic M-theory are perturbatively stable.
Our analysis treats all modes arising from the graviton and the q-form, and is
completely independent of supersymmetry. From the masses of the linearized
perturbations, we obtain the dimensions of some operators in possible
holographic dual CFT's. Solutions with more general compact Einstein spaces
need not be stable, and in particular AdS_p x S^n x S^{q-n} is unstable for q <
9 but is stable for q >= 9. We also study the AdS_4 x S^6 compactification of
massive type IIA supergravity, which differs from the usual Freund-Rubin
compactification in that there is a cosmological term already in ten
dimensions. This nonsupersymmetric vacuum is unstable.
