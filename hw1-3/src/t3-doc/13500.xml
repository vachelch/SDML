Some General Problems in Quantum Gravity II: The Three Dimensional Case
</title>

<abstract>
  The general problems of three-dimensional quantum gravity are recatitulated
here, putting the emphasis on the mathematical problems of defining the measure
of the path integral over all three-dimensional metrics.This work should be
viewed as an extension of a preceding one on the four dimensional case
(\cite{kn:eav5}), where also some general ideas are discussed in detail. We
finally put forward some suggestions on the lines one could expect further
progress in the field.
