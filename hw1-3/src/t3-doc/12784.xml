Gauge Theories: Geometry and cohomological invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a geometrical structure of the manifolds $\Gamma$ and $\hat\Gamma$
associated respectively to the gauge symmetry and to the BRST symmetry. Then,
we show that ($\hat\Gamma,\hat\zeta,\Gamma$), where $\hat\zeta$ is the group of
BRST transformations, is endowed with the structure of a principle fiber bundle
over the base manifold $\Gamma$. Furthermore, in this geometrical set up due to
the nilpotency of the BRST operator, we prove that the effective action of a
gauge theory is a BRST-exact term up to the classical action. Then, we conclude
that the effective action where only the gauge symmetry is fixed, is
cohomologically equivalent to the action where the gauge and the BRST
symmetries are fixed.
