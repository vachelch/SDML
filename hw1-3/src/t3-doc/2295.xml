Monopoles and Harmonic Maps
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently Jarvis has proved a correspondence between SU(N) monopoles and
rational maps of the Riemann sphere into flag manifolds. Furthermore, he has
outlined a construction to obtain the monopole fields from the rational map. In
this paper we examine this construction in some detail and provide explicit
examples for spherically symmetric SU(N) monopoles with various symmetry
breakings. In particular we show how to obtain these monopoles from harmonic
maps into complex projective spaces. The approach extends in a natural way to
monopoles in hyperbolic space and we use it to construct new spherically
symmetric SU(N) hyperbolic monopoles.
