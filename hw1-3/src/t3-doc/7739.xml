<title>
Higher Spin Field Equation in a Virtual Black Hole Metric
</title>

<abstract>
  In a quantum theory of gravity, fluctuations about the vacuum may be
considered as Planck scale virtual black holes appearing and annihilating in
pairs. Incident fields scattering from such fluctuations would lose quantum
coherence.
  In a recent paper (hep-th/9705147), Hawking and Ross obtained an estimate for
the magnitude of this loss in the case of a scalar field. Their calculation
exploited the separability of the conformally invariant scalar wave equation in
the electrovac C metric background, which is justified as a sufficiently good
description of a virtual black hole pair in the limit considered.
  In anticipation of extending this result, the Teukolsky equations for
incident fields of higher spin are separated on the vacuum C metric background
and solved in the same limit. With the exception of spin 2 fields, these
equations are shown in addition to be valid on the electrovac C metric
background. The angular solutions are found to reduce to the spin- weighted
spherical harmonics, and the radial solutions are found to approach
hypergeometrics close to the horizons.
  By defining appropriate scattering boundary conditions, these solutions are
then used to estimate the transmission and reflection coefficients for an
incident field of spin s. The transmission coefficient is required in order to
estimate the loss of quantum coherence of an incident field through scattering
off virtual black holes.
