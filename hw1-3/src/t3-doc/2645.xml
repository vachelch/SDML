Remarks on Covariant Matrix Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We address the issue of the worldsheet and spacetime covariant formulation
for matrix strings. The problem is solved in the limit of vanishing string
coupling. To go beyond the g_s = 0 limit, we propose a topological quantum
field theory as a twisted candidate. Our model involves the generalized
octonionic or SU(4) instanton equations defined in eight dimensions for a
supersymmetric U(N) Yang--Mills field living on a special holonomy manifold.
The question of untwisting this matrix model into an anomaly free theory
enlightens the need for an "extended" 2d-gravity sector, that we suggest could
be (partially twisted) W-gravity.
