Note on (D6,D8) Bound State, Massive Duality and Non-commutativity
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study half-supersymmetric (D6,D8) bound state brane
configuration of massive type IIA supergravity. We show that this bound state
can also be generated by using massive T-duality rules of type-II
supergravities in D=9, starting from D7-branes. We write down corresponding
Killing spinors and find that these backgrounds indeed preserve 16
supersymmetries like any other D$p$-brane bound state with $B$-field. We also
make a point on the massive nature of the $B$-field in this background. The
Seiberg-Witten limits to obtain 9-dimensional NCYMs are also discussed, but the
full understanding of such gauge theories remains unanswered.
