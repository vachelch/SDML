<title>
Cubic Matrix, Generalized Spin Algebra and Uncertainty Relation
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a generalization of spin algebra using three-index objects. There
is a possibility that a triple commutation relation among three-index objects
implies a kind of uncertainty relation among their expectation values.
