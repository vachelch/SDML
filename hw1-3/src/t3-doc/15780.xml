<title>
Exact Solution of the Six-Vertex Model on a Random Lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve exactly the 6-vertex model on a dynamical random lattice, using its
representation as a large N matrix model. The model describes a gas of dense
nonintersecting oriented loops coupled to the local curvature defects on the
lattice. The model can be mapped to the c=1 string theory, compactified at some
length depending on the vertex coupling. We give explicit expression for the
disk amplitude and evaluate the fractal dimension of its boundary, the average
number of loops and the dimensions of the vortex operators, which vary
continuously with the vertex coupling.
