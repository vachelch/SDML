<title>
Nonrelativistic Factorizable Scattering Theory of Multicomponent
  Calogero-Sutherland Model
</title>

<abstract>
We relate two integrable models in (1+1) dimensions, namely, multicomponent
Calogero-Sutherland model with particles and antiparticles interacting via the
hyperbolic potential and the nonrelativistic factorizable $S$-matrix theory
with $SU(N)$-invariance. We find complete solutions of the Yang-Baxter
equations without implementing the crossing symmetry, and one of them is
identified with the scattering amplitudes derived from the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation of the Calogero-Sutherland model. This particular solution is of
interest in that it cannot be obtained as a nonrelativistic limit of any known
relativistic solutions of the $SU(N)$-invariant Yang-Baxter equations.
