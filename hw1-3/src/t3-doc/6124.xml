4D Doubleton Conformal Theories, CPT and IIB String on AdS_5 X S^5
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the unitary supermultiplets of the N=8, d=5 anti-de Sitter (AdS)
superalgebra SU(2,2|4) which is the symmetry algebra of the IIB string theory
on AdS_5 X S^5. We give a complete classification of the doubleton
supermultiplets of SU(2,2|4) which do not have a Poincare limit and correspond
to d=4 conformal field theories (CFT) living on the boundary of AdS_5. The CPT
self-conjugate irreducible doubleton supermultiplet corresponds to d=4, N = 4
super Yang-Mills theory. The other irreducible doubleton supermultiplets come
in CPT conjugate pairs. The maximum spin range of the general doubleton
supermultiplets is 2. In particular, there exists a CPT conjugate pair of
doubleton supermultiplets corresponding to the fields of N=4 conformal
supergravity in d=4 which can be coupled to N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in d=4.
We also study the "massless" supermultiplets of SU(2,2|4) which can be obtained
by tensoring two doubleton supermultiplets. The CPT self-conjugate "massless"
supermultiplet is the N=8 graviton supermultiplet in AdS_5. The other
"massless" supermultiplets generally come in conjugate pairs and can have
maximum spin range of 4. We discuss the implications of our results for the
conjectured CFT/AdS dualities.
