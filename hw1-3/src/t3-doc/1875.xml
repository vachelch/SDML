<title>
Towards c=0 Flows
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some implications of the gravitational dressing of the
renormalization group for conformal field theories perturbed by relevant
operators. The renormalization group flows are defined with respect to the
dilatation operator associated with the $J_0^{(0)}$ mode of the $SL(2,R)$
affine algebra. We discuss the possibility of passing under the $c=25$ barrier
along renormalization group flows in some models.
