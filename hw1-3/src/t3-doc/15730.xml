<title>
de Sitter space from M-theory?
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we study a massive IIA supergravity theory obtained in
hep-th/9707139 by compactification of M-theory. We point out that de Sitter
space in arbitrary dimensions arises naturally as the vacuum of this theory.
This explicitly shows how de Sitter space can be embedded into
eleven-dimensional supergravity. In addition we discuss the novel way in which
this theory avoids various `no-go theorems' which assert that de Sitter space
is not a consistent vacua of eleven-dimensional supergravity theory. We also
point out that the eight-branes of this theory, which couple electrically to
the ten-form, can sweep out de Sitter world-volumes.
