Black Hole Condensation and the Web of Calabi-Yau Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We review recent work concerning topology changing phase transitions through
black hole condensation in Type II string theory. We then also briefly describe
a present study aimed at extending the known web of interconnections between
Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show, for instance, that all 7555 Calabi-Yau
hypersurfaces in weighted projective four space are mathematically connected by
extremal transitions.
