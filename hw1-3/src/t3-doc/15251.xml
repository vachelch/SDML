<title>
Is nonsymmetric gravity related to string theory?
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we raise the question whether nonsymmetric gravity and string
theory are related. We start making the observation, that the gravitational
field $ g_{\mu\nu}$ and the nonsymmetric gauge field $ A_{\mu\nu}$
arising in the low energy limit in the string theory are exactly the same two
basic fields used in four dimensions in nonsymmetric gravity. We argue, that
this connection between nonsymmetric gravity and string theory at the level of
the gauge fields $ g_{\mu\nu}$ and $ A_{\mu\nu}$ is not, however,
reflected at the level of the corresponding associated actions. In an effort to
find a connection between such an actions we discover a new gravitational
action, which suggests an alternative version of the bosonic string in which
the target and the world-volume metrics are unified.
