Order $1/N^2$ test of the Maldacena conjecture II: the full bulk
  one-loop contribution to the boundary Weyl anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the complete bulk one-loop contribution to the Weyl anomaly of the
boundary theory for IIB Supergravity compactified on $ AdS_5\times S^5$. The
result, that $\delta {\cal A}=(E+I)/(2\pi^2)$, reproduces the subleading term
in the exact expression ${\cal A}=-(N^2-1)(E+I)/(2\pi^2)$ for the Weyl anomaly
of ${\cal N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory, confirming the Maldacena conjecture.
The anomaly receives contributions from all multiplets casting doubt on the
possibility of describing the boundary theory beyond leading order in $N$ by a
consistent truncation to the `massless' multiplet of IIB Supergravity.
