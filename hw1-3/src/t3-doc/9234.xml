Matrix Description of (1,0) Theories in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose descriptions of interacting (1,0) supersymmetric theories without
gravity in six dimensions in the infinite momentum frame. They are based on the
large N limit of quantum mechanics or 1+1 dimensional field theories with SO(N)
gauge group and four supercharges. We argue that this formulation allows for a
concrete description of the chirality-changing phase transitions which connect
(1,0) theories with different numbers of tensor multiplets.
