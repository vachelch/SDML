<title>
Boundary states for a free boson defined on finite geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  Langlands recently constructed a map that factorizes the partition function
of a free boson on a cylinder with boundary condition given by two arbitrary
functions in the form of a scalar product of boundary states. We rewrite these
boundary states in a compact form, getting rid of technical assumptions
necessary in his construction. This simpler form allows us to show explicitly
that the map between boundary conditions and states commutes with conformal
transformations preserving the boundary and the reality condition on the scalar
field.
