<title>
From Quantum Monodromy to Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  For $N\!=\!2$ SUSY theories with non-vanishing $\beta$-function and
one-dimensional quantum moduli, we study the representation on the special
coordinates of the group of motions on the quantum moduli defined by
$\Gamma_W\!=\!Sl(2;Z)\!/\!\Gamma_M$, with $\Gamma_M$ the quantum monodromy
group. $\Gamma_W$ contains both the global symmetries and the strong-weak
coupling duality. The action of $\Gamma_W$ on the special coordinates is not
part of the symplectic group $Sl(2;Z)$. After coupling to gravity, namely in
the context of non-rigid special geometry, we can define the action of
$\Gamma_W$ as part of $Sp(4;Z)$. To do this requires singular gauge
transformations on the "scalar" component of the graviphoton field. In terms of
these singular gauge transformations the topological obstruction to strong-weak
duality can be interpreted as a $\sigma$-model anomaly, indicating the possible
dynamical role of the dilaton field in $S$-duality.
