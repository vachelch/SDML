<title>
A Short Introduction to Bit-String Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper starts with a personal memoir of how some significant ideas arose
and events took place during the period from 1972, when I first encountered Ted
Bastin, to 1979, when I proposed the foundation of ANPA. I then discuss program
universe, the fine structure paper and its rejection, the quantitative results
up to ANPA 17 and take a new look at the handy-dandy formula. Following this
historical material is a first pass at establishing new foundations for
bit-string physics. An abstract model for a laboratory notebook and an
historical record are developed, culminating in the bit-string representation.
I set up a tic-toc laboratory with two synchronized clocks and show how this
can be used to analyze arbitrary incoming data. This allows me to discuss
(briefly) finite and discrete Lorentz transformations, commutation relations,
and scattering theory. Earlier work on conservation laws in 3- and 4-events and
the free space Dirac and Maxwell equations is cited. The paper concludes with a
discussion of the quantum gravity problem from our point of view and
speculations about how a bit-string theory of strong, electromagnetic, weak and
gravitational unification could take shape.
