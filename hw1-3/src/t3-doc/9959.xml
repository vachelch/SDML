Patterns of Duality in N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the patterns in the duality of a wide class of N=1 supersymmetric
gauge theories in four dimensions. We present many new generalizations of the
classic duality models of Kutasov and Schwimmer, which have themselves been
generalized numerous times in works of Intriligator, Leigh and the present
authors. All of these models contain one or two fields in a two-index tensor
representation, along with fields in the defining representation. The
superpotential for the two-index tensor(s) resembles A_k or D_k singularity
forms, generalized from numbers to matrices. Looking at the ensemble of these
models, classifying them by superpotential, gauge group, and ``level'' -- for
terminology we appeal to the architecture of a typical European-style theatre
-- we identify emerging patterns and note numerous interesting puzzles.
