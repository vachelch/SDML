<title>
Gaussian Effective Potential Analysis of Sinh(Sine)-Gordon Models by New
  Regularization-Renormalization Scheme
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the new regularization and renormalization scheme recently proposed by
Yang and used by Ni et al, we analyse the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models
within the framework of Gaussian effective potential in D+1 dimensions. Our
analysis suffers no divergence and so does not suffer from the manipulational
obscurities in the conventional analysis of divergent integrals. Our main
conclusions agree exactly with those of Ingermanson for D=1,2 but disagree
for D=3: the D=3 sinh(sine)-Gordon model is non-trivial. Furthermore, our
analysis shows that for D=1,2, the running coupling constant (RCC)has poles
for sine-Gordon model($\gamma^2<0$) and the sinh-Gordon model ($\gamma^2>0$)
has a possible critical point $\gamma^2_c$ while for D=3, the RCC has poles for
both $\gamma^2>0$ and $\gamma^2<0$.
