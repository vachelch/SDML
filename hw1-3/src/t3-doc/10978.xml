HyperK\"{a}hler Quotient Construction of BPS Monopole Moduli Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the HyperK\"{a}hler quotient of flat space to obtain some monopole
moduli space metrics in explicit form. Using this new description, we discuss
their topology, completeness and isometries. We construct the moduli space
metrics in the limit when some monopoles become massless, which corresponds to
non-maximal symmetry breaking of the gauge group. We also introduce a new
family of HyperK"{a}hler metrics which, depending on the ``mass parameter''
being positive or negative, give rise to either the asymptotic metric on the
moduli space of many SU(2) monopoles, or to previously unknown metrics. These
new metrics are complete if one carries out the quotient of a non-zero level
set of the moment map, but develop singularities when the zero-set is
considered. These latter metrics are of relevance to the moduli spaces of vacua
of three dimensional gauge theories for higher rank gauge groups. Finally, we
make a few comments concerning the existence of closed or bound orbits on some
of these manifolds and the integrability of the geodesic flow.
