<title>
Black Hole Geometry around an Elementary BPS String State
</title>

<abstract>
  We probe the geometry around an elementary BPS (EBPS) state in heterotic
string theory compactified on a six-torus by scattering a massless scalar off
it and comparing with the corresponding experiment in which the EBPS state is
replaced by a classical extremal black hole background satisfying the BPS
condition. We find that the low energy limit of the scattering amplitudes
precisely agree if one takes the limit $m_{\rm bh} >> m_P$. In the classical
experiment, beyond a certain frequency of the incident wave, part of the wave
is found to be absorbed by the black hole, whereas in case of the string
scattering there is a critical frequency (inelastic threshold) of the probe
beyond which the EBPS state gets excited to a higher mass non-BPS elementary
state. The classical absorption threshold matches exactly with the inelastic
threshold in the limit of maximum degeneracy of the EBPS state of a given mass.
In that limit we can therefore identify absorption by the black hole as
excitation of the elementary string state to the next vibrational state of the
string and consequently also identify the non-BPS string state as a
non-extremal black hole.
