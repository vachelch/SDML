<title>
Lie algebra cohomology and group structure of gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly construct the adjoint operator of coboundary operator and
obtain the Hodge decomposition theorem and the Poincar\'e duality for the Lie
algebra cohomology of the infinite-dimensional gauge transformation group. We
show that the adjoint of the coboundary operator can be identified with the
BRST adjoint generator $Q^{\dagger}$ for the Lie algebra cohomology induced by
BRST generator $Q$. We also point out an interesting duality relation -
Poincar\'e duality - with respect to gauge anomalies and Wess-Zumino-Witten
topological terms. We consider the consistent embedding of the BRST adjoint
generator $Q^{\dagger}$ into the relativistic phase space and identify the
noncovariant symmetry recently discovered in QED with the BRST adjoint N\"other
charge $Q^{\dagger}$.
