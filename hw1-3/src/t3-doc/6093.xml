<title>
Closed Inhomogeneous String Cosmologies
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a general algorithm which permits to construct solutions in string
cosmology for heterotic and type-IIB superstrings in four dimensions. Using a
chain of transformations applied in sequence: conformal, T-duality and SL(2,R)
rotations, along with the usual generating techniques associated to Geroch
transformations in Einstein frame, we obtain solutions with all relevant
low-energy remnants of the string theory. To exemplify our algorithm we present
an inhomogeneous string cosmology with S^3 topology of spatial sections,
discuss some properties of the solution and point out some subtleties involved
in the concept of homogeneity and isotropy in string cosmology.
