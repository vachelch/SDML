Canonical and quantum FRW cosmological solutions in M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the canonical and quantum cosmological investigation of a
spatially flat, four-dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model that is
derived from the M-theory effective action obtained originally by Billyard,
Coley, Lidsey and Nilsson (BCLN). The analysis makes use of two sets of
canonical variables, the Shanmugadhasan gauge invariant canonical variables and
the ``hybrid'' variables which diagonalise the Hamiltonian. We find the
observables and discuss in detail the phase space of the classical theory. In
particular, a region of the phase space exists that describes a
four-dimensional FRW spacetime first contracting from a strong coupling regime
and then expanding to a weak coupling regime, while the internal space ever
contracts. We find the quantum solutions of the model and obtain the positive
norm Hilbert space of states. Finally, the correspondence between wave
functions and classical solutions is outlined.
