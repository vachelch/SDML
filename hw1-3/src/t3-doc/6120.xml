BPS Saturated Domain Walls along a Compact Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalized Wess-Zumino models which admit topologically non-trivial BPS
saturated configurations along one compact, spatial dimension are investigated
in various dimensions of space-time. We show that, in a representative model
and for sufficiently large circumference, there are BPS configurations along
the compact dimension containing an arbitrary number of equidistant,
well-separated domain walls. We analyze the spectrum of the bosonic and
fermionic light and massless modes that are localized on these walls. The
masses of the light modes are exponentially suppressed by the ratio of the
distance between the walls and their width. States that are initially localized
on one wall oscillate in time between all the walls. In (2+1) dimensions the
``chirality'' of localized, massless fermions is determined. In the
(1+1)-dimensional case we show how the mass of certain classically BPS
saturated solitons is lifted above the BPS bound by instanton tunneling.
