S-duality and Strong Coupling Behavior of Large N Gauge Theories with
  N=4 Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the strong coupling behavior of the large N gauge theories in
4-dimensions with N=4 supersymmetry by making use of S-duality. We show that at
large values of the coupling constant $\lambda=g_{YM}^2N$ the j-th non-planar
amplitude $f_j(\lambda) (j=0,1,2 ...)$ behaves as $f_j(\lambda)\approx
\lambda^j$. Implication of this behavior is discussed in connection with the
supergravity theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$ suggested by the CFT/AdS
correspondence. S-duality of the gauge theory corresponds to the duality
between the closed and open string loop expansions in the gravity/string
theory.
