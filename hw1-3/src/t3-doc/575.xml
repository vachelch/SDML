<title>
Centers of Mass and Rotational Kinematics for the Relativistic N-Body
  Problem in the Rest-Frame Instant Form
</title>

<abstract>
  In the Wigner-covariant rest-frame instant form of dynamics it is possible to
develop a relativistic kinematics for the N-body problem. The Wigner
hyperplanes define the intrinsic rest frame and realize the separation of the
center-of-mass. Three notions of {\it external} relativistic center of mass can
be defined only in terms of the {\it external} Poincar\'e group realization.
Inside the Wigner hyperplane, an {\it internal} unfaithful realization of the
Poincar\'e group is defined. The three concepts of {\it internal} center of
mass weakly {\it coincide} and are eliminated by the rest-frame conditions. An
adapted canonical basis of relative variables is found. The invariant mass is
the Hamiltonian for the relative motions. In this framework we can introduce
the same {\it dynamical body frames}, {\it orientation-shape} variables, {\it
spin frame} and {\it canonical spin bases} for the rotational kinematics
developed for the non-relativistic N-body problem.
