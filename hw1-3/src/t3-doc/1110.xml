Some Examples of Chiral Moduli Spaces and Dynamical Supersymmetry
  Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the low-energy dynamics of $SU(N)$ gauge theories with one
antisymmetric tensor field, $N - 4 + N_f$ antifundamentals and $N_f$
fundamentals, for $N_f \le 3$. For $N_f = 3$ we construct the quantum moduli
space, and for $N_f < 3$ we find the exact quantum superpotentials. We find two
large classes of models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking. The odd $N$
theories break supersymmetry once appropriate mass terms are added in the
superpotential.
 The even $N$ theories break supersymmetry after gauging an extra chiral $U(1)$
symmetry.
