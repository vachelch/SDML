Aspects of the M5-Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  The kappa symmetry of an open M2-brane ending on an M5-brane requires
geometrical constraints on the embedding of the system in target superspace.
These constraints lead to the M5-brane equations of motion, which we review
both in superspace and in component (i.e. in Green-Schwarz) formalism. We also
describe the embedding of the chiral M5-brane theory in a non-chiral theory
where the equations of motion follow from an action that involves a non-chiral
2-form potential, upon the imposition of a non-linear self-duality condition.
In this formulation, we find a simplified form of the second order field
equation for the worldvolume 2-form potential, and we derive the nonlinear
holomorphicity condition on the partition function of the chiral M5-brane.
