<title>
Braneworld Flattening by a Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a model with an infinite volume bulk in which a braneworld with a
cosmological constant evolves to a static, 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
This evolution occurs for a generic class of initial conditions with positive
energy densities. The metric everywhere outside the brane is that of a
5-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, where the effect of the brane is the
creation of a frame with a varying speed of light. This fact is encoded in the
structure of the 4-dimensional graviton propagator on the braneworld, which may
lead to some interesting Lorentz symmetry violating effects. In our framework
the cosmological constant problem takes a different meaning since the flatness
of the Universe is guaranteed for an arbitrary negative cosmological constant.
Instead constraints on the model come from different concerns which we discuss
in detail.
