<title>
Form Factors in Affine Toda Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  I briefly review the properties of classical affine Toda field theories and
indicate how some of this features survive in the quantum theory on-shell. I
demonstrate how this knowledge can be extended off-shell, i.e. how to compute
correlation functions for completely integrable models via the form factor
approach. For the latter I present an axiomatic system and two explicit
computation (the Sinh-Gordon theory and the Bullough-Dodd model) which provide
a consistent solution of it. (Talk presented at the VII Andr\'e Swieca Summer
School, Campos do Jord\~ao, Brasil, 1993)
