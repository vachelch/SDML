Cyclic Coset Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the new orbifold duality transformations to discuss the special case
of cyclic coset orbifolds in further detail. We focus in particular on the case
of the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds, whose untwisted sectors are
Z_\lambda(permutation)-invariant g/h coset constructions which are not \lambda
copies of coset constructions. Because \lambda copies are not involved, the
action of Z_\lambda(permutation) in the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds can
be quite intricate. The stress tensors and ground state conformal weights of
all the sectors of a large class of these orbifolds are given explicitly and
special emphasis is placed on the twisted h subalgebras which are generated by
the twisted (0,0) operators of these orbifolds. We also discuss the systematics
of twisted (0,0) operators in general coset orbifolds.
