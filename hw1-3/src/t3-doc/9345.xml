<title>
Symmetry Breaking for Matter Coupled to Linearized Supergravity From the
  Perspective of the Current Supermultiplet
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a generic supersymmetric matter theory coupled to linearized
supergravity, and analyze scenarios for spontaneous symmetry breaking in terms
of vacuum expectation values of components of the current supermultiplet. When
the vacuum expectation of the energy momentum tensor is zero, but the scalar
current or pseudoscalar current gets an expectation, evaluation of the
gravitino self energy using the supersymmetry current algebra shows that there
is an induced gravitino mass term. The structure of this term generalizes the
supergravity action with cosmological constant to theories with CP violation.
When the vacuum expectation of the energy momentum tensor is nonzero,
supersymmetry is broken; requiring cancellation of the cosmological constant
gives the corresponding generalized gravitino mass formula.
