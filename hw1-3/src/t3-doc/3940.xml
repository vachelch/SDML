<title>
Rotating deformations of AdS_3\times S^3, the orbifold CFT and strings
  in the pp-wave limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an exact metric which at short distances is the metric of
massless particles in 5+1 spacetime (moving along a diameter of the sphere) and
is AdS_3\times S^3 at infinity. We also consider a set of a conical defect
spacetimes which are locally AdS_3\times S^3 and have the masses and charges of
a special set of chiral primaries of the dual orbifold CFT. We find that
excitation energies for a scalar field in the latter geometries agree exactly
with the excitations in the corresponding CFT state created by twist operators:
redshift in the geometry reproduces `long circle' physics in the CFT. We
propose a map of string states in AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4 to states in the
orbifold CFT, analogous to the recently discovered map for AdS_5\times S^5. The
vibrations of the string can be pictured as oscillations of a Fermi sea in the
CFT.
