Boundary states for WZW models
</title>

<abstract>
  The boundary states for a certain class of WZW models are determined. The
models include all modular invariants that are associated to a symmetry of the
unextended Dynkin diagram. Explicit formulae for the boundary state
coefficients are given in each case, and a number of properties of the
corresponding NIM-reps are derived.
