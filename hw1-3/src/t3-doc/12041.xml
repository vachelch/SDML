Exact multi-membrane solutions in AdS_7
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the properties of an exact multi-membrane solution in
seven-dimensional maximal SO(5)-gauged supergravity. Unlike previously known
multi-centered solutions, the present one is asymptotically anti-de Sitter. We
show that this multi-membrane configuration preserves only a quarter of the
supersymmetries. When lifted to eleven dimensions, this solution is interpreted
as a set of open membranes ending on self-dual strings on a stack of M5-branes,
in the near M5 limit.
