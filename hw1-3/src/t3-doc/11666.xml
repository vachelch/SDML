<title>
Spectral asymmetry for bag boundary conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an expression, in terms of boundary spectral functions, for the
spectral asymmetry of the Euclidean Dirac operator in two dimensions, when its
domain is determined by local boundary conditions, and the manifold is of
product type. As an application, we explicitly evaluate the asymmetry in the
case of a finite-length cylinder, and check that the outcome is consistent with
our general result. Finally, we study the asymmetry in a disk, which is a
non-product case, and propose an interpretation.
