States and Curves of Five-Dimensional Gauged Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the sector of N=8 five-dimensional gauged supergravity with
non-trivial scalar fields in the coset space SL(6,R)/SO(6), plus the metric. We
find that the most general supersymmetric solution is parametrized by six real
moduli and analyze its properties using the theory of algebraic curves. In the
generic case, where no continuous subgroup of the original SO(6) symmetry
remains unbroken, the algebraic curve of the corresponding solution is a
Riemann surface of genus seven. When some cycles shrink to zero size the
symmetry group is enhanced, whereas the genus of the Riemann surface is lowered
accordingly. The uniformization of the curves is carried out explicitly and
yields various supersymmetric configurations in terms of elliptic functions. We
also analyze the ten-dimensional type-IIB supergravity origin of our solutions
and show that they represent the gravitational field of a large number of
D3-branes continuously distributed on hyper-surfaces embedded in the
six-dimensional space transverse to the branes. The spectra of massless scalar
and graviton excitations are also studied on these backgrounds by casting the
associated differential equations into Schrodinger equations with non-trivial
potentials. The potentials are found to be of Calogero type, rational or
elliptic, depending on the background configuration that is used.
