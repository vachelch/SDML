Bi-local Fields in Noncommutative Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a bi-local representation in noncommutative field theory. It
provides a simple description for high momentum degrees of freedom. It also
shows that the low momentum modes can be well approximated by ordinary local
fields. Long range interactions are generated in the effective action for the
lower momentum modes after integrating out the high momentum bi-local fields.
The low momentum modes can be represented by diagonal blocks in the matrix
model picture and the high momentum bi-local fields correspond to off-diagonal
blocks. This block-block interaction picture simply reproduces the infrared
singular behaviors of nonplanar diagrams in noncommutative field theory.
