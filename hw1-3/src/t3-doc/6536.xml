<title>
Quantum black hole entropy and Newton constant renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the status of the black hole entropy formula $S_{\rm BH} = A_H
/4G$ in low energy effective field theory. The low energy expansion of the
black hole entropy is studied in a non-equilibrium situation: the semiclassical
decay of hot flat space by black hole nucleation. In this context the entropy
can be defined as an enhancement factor in the semiclassical decay rate, which
is dominated by a sphaleron-like saddle point. We find that all perturbative
divergences appearing in Euclidean calculations of the entropy can be
renormalized in low energy couplings. We also discuss some formal aspects of
the relation between the Euclidean and Hamiltonian approaches to the one loop
corrections to black hole entropy and geometric entropy, and we emphasize the
virtues of the use of covariant regularization prescriptions. In fact, the
definition of black hole entropy in terms of decay rates {\it requires} the use
of covariant measures and accordingly, covariant regularizations in path
integrals. Finally, we speculate on the possibility that low energy effective
field theory could be sufficient to understand the microscopic degrees of
freedom underlying black hole entropy. We propose a qualitative physical
picture in which black hole entropy refers to a space of quasi-coherent states
of infalling matter, together with its gravitational field. We stress that this
scenario might provide a low energy explanation of both the black hole entropy
and the information puzzle.
