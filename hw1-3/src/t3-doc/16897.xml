Reduction of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equation - a Way of Producing
  Virasoro Algebra Singular Vectors
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the sl(2,C) KZ equation for (half-) integer isospins
recovers, up to a gauge transformation, the matrix system for Virasoro algebra
singular vectors of Bauer et al. In the case of Kac-Kazhdan spins the general
(infinite matrix) KZ system is truncated due to the decoupling of the A^(1)_1
singular vectors. This suggests an algorithm converting Malikov-Feigin-Fuks
singular vectors into Virasoro ones.
