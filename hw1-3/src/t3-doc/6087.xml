<title>
Invariant Regularization of Supersymmetric Chiral Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate a manifestly supersymmetric gauge covariant regularization of
supersymmetric chiral gauge theories. In our scheme, the effective action in
the superfield background field method above one-loop is always supersymmetric
and gauge invariant. The gauge anomaly has a covariant form and can emerge only
in one-loop diagrams with all the external lines being the background gauge
superfield. We also present several illustrative applications in the one-loop
approximation: the self-energy part of the chiral multiplet and of the gauge
multiplet; the super-chiral anomaly and the superconformal anomaly; as the
corresponding anomalous commutators, the Konishi anomaly and an anomalous
supersymmetric transformation law of the supercurrent (the ``central
extension'' of N=1 supersymmetry algebra) and of the R-current.
