From Compact U(1) Maxwell Chern-Simons to Azbel-Hofstadter: Testing
  Magnetic Monopoles and Gravity to ~10^{-17}m on a Nearby Laboratory
</title>

<abstract>
  It is built a map between the Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) 3D
compact U(1) gauge Maxwell Chern-Simons and the nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics Azbel-Hofstadter model of Bloch-electrons. The $U_q(sl_2)$ quantum
group and the magnetic translations group of the Azbel-Hofstadter model
correspond to discretized U(1) gauge transformations, they correspond to
subgroups with linear gauge parameter. The monopole confining and monopole
condensate phases in the TQFT are identified with the extended (energy bands)
and localized (gaps) phases of the bloch electron. The monopole condensate
induces at the nonrelativistic level gravitational white holes due to deformed
classical gauge fields, furthermore these gravitational solutions render the
existence of finite energy pure magnetic monopoles possible. This mechanism
constitutes a dynamical symmetry breaking of the theory which regularizes the
solutions on those localized phases allowing physical solutions of the
Shr\"odinger equation which are chains of electron strings connecting several
monopole-white holes. An experiment to test these results is suggested which
would test the existence of magnetic monopoles and classical gravity to a scale
of $\sim 10^{-17}$ \textit{meters}, the dimension of the monopole-white hole.
