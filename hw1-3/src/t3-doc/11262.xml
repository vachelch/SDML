Pair Correlation Function of Wilson Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a path integral prescription for the pair correlation function of
Wilson loops lying in the worldvolume of Dbranes in the bosonic open and closed
string theory. The results can be applied both in ordinary flat spacetime in
the critical dimension d or in the presence of a generic background for the
Liouville field. We compute the potential between heavy nonrelativistic sources
in an abelian gauge theory in relative collinear motion with velocity v =
tanh(u), probing length scales down to r_min^2 = 2 \pi \alpha' u. We predict a
universal -(d-2)/r static interaction at short distances. We show that the
velocity dependent corrections to the short distance potential in the bosonic
string take the form of an infinite power series in the dimensionless variables
z = r_min^2/r^2, uz/\pi, and u^2.
