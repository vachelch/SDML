Comparing strings in AdS(5)xS(5) to planar diagrams: an example
</title>

<abstract>
  The correlator of a Wilson loop with a local operator in N=4 SYM theory can
be represented by a string amplitude in AdS(5)xS(5). This amplitude describes
an overlap of the boundary state, which is associated with the loop, with the
string mode, which is dual to the local operator. For chiral primary operators
with a large R charge, the amplitude can be calculated by semiclassical
techniques. We compare the semiclassical string amplitude to the SYM
perturbation theory and find an exact agrement to the first two non-vanishing
orders.
