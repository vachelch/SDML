<title>
Little String Theory at a TeV
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a framework where the string scale as well as all compact
dimensions are at the electroweak scale $\sim$ TeV$^{-1}$. The weakness of
gravity is attributed to the small value of the string coupling $g_s \sim
10^{-16}$, presumably a remnant of the dilaton's runaway behavior, suggesting
the possibility of a common solution to the hierarchy and dilaton-runaway
problems. In spite of the small $g_s$, in type II string theories with gauge
interactions localized in the vicinity of NS5-branes, the standard model gauge
couplings are of order one and are associated with the sizes of compact
dimensions. At a TeV these theories exhibit higher dimensional and stringy
behavior. The models are holographically dual to a higher dimensional
non-critical string theory and this can be used to compute the experimentally
accessible spectrum and self-couplings of the little strings. In spite of the
stringy behavior, gravity remains weak and can be ignored at collider energies.
The Damour-Polyakov mechanism is an automatic consequence of our scenario and
suggests the presence of a massless conformally-coupled scalar, leading to
potentially observable deviations from Einstein's theory, including violations
of the equivalence principle.
