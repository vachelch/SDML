<title>
On the determination of the dilaton-antisymmetric tensor couplings in
  supergravity theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A new approach is provided to determine the dilaton--antisymmetric tensor
coupling in a supergravity theory by considering the static supersymmetric
field configuration around a super extended object, which is consistently
formulated in a curved superspace. By this, the corresponding SUSY
transformation rules can also be determined for vanishing fermionic fields as
well as bosonic fields other than those in the determined coupling. Therefore,
we can, in turn, use this determined part of the supergravity theory to study
all the related vacuum-like solutions. We have determined the
dilaton--antisymmetric tensor couplings, in which each of the antisymmetric
tensors is a singlet of the automorphism group of the corresponding
superalgebra, for every supergravity multiplet. This actually happens only for
$N \leq 2$ supergravity theories, which agrees completely with the spin-content
analysis and the classified $N \leq 2$ super $p$-branes, therefore giving more
support to the existence of the fundamental Type II $p$-branes. A prediction is
made of the $D = 9, N = 2$ supergravity which has not yet been written down so
far.
