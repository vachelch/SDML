A Class of N=1 Supersymmetric RG Flows from Five-dimensional N = 8
  Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the holographic dual of a general class of N=1* flows in which
all three chiral multiplets have independent masses, and in which the
corresponding Yang-Mills scalars can develop particular
supersymmetry-preserving vevs. We also allow the gaugino to develop a vev. This
leads to a six parameter subspace of the supergravity scalar action, and we
show that this is a consistent truncation, and obtain a superpotential that
governs the N=1* flows on this subspace. We analyse some of the structure of
the superpotential, and check consistency with the asymptotic behaviour near
the UV fixed point. We show that the dimensions of the six couplings obey a sum
rule all along the N=1* flows. We also show how our superpotential describes
part of the Coulomb branch of the non-trivial N=1 fixed point theory.
