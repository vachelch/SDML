Duality and Bosonisation in Arbitrary Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A functional integral approach is developed to discuss the bosonisation of
the massive Thirring and the massive Schwinger models in arbitrary
D-dimensions. It is found that these models, to {\it all} orders in the inverse
fermi mass, bosonise to a theory involving a usual gauge field and a (D-2) rank
antisymmetric (Kalb-Ramond) tensor field. Explicit bosonisation identities for
the fermion current are deduced. Specialising to the lowest order reveals (for
any $D \geq 4$) a mapping between the massive Thirring model and the Proca
model. It also establishes an exact duality between the Proca model and the
massive (D-2) rank Kalb-Ramond model. Schwinger terms in the current algebra
are computed. Conventional bosonisation results in D=2, 3 are reproduced.
