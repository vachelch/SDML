A Microscopical Description of Giant Gravitons II: The AdS_5 x S^5
  Background
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we continue with the microscopical investigation of giant
graviton configurations in AdS_m x S^n spacetimes, initiated in hep-th/0207199.
Using dualities and a Matrix theory derivation we propose an action that
describes multiple Type IIB gravitons. This action contains multipole moment
couplings to the Type IIB background potentials. Using these couplings, we
study, from the microscopical point of view, the giant graviton and dual giant
graviton configurations in the AdS_5 x S^5 background. In both cases the
gravitons expand into a non-commutative 3-sphere, that is defined as an
S^1-bundle over a fuzzy 2-sphere. When the number of gravitons is large we find
perfect agreement with the Abelian, macroscopical description of giant
gravitons in this spacetime, given in the literature.
