<title>
Four-Dimensional N=1 Super Yang-Mills Theory from an M-Theory Orbifold
</title>

<abstract>
  Gravitational and gauge anomalies provide stringent constraints on which
subset of chiral models can effectively describe M-theory at low energy. In
this paper, we explicitly construct an abelian orbifold of M-theory to obtain
an N=1, chiral super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, using anomaly
matching to determine the entire gauge and representation structure. The model
described in this paper is the simplest four dimensional model which one can
construct from M-theory compactified on an abelian orbifold without
freely-acting involutions. The gauge group is SO(12) x SU(8) x SU(2) x SU(2) x
U(1).
