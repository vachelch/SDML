USp(2k) Matrix Model: Nonperturbative Approach to Orientifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss theoretical implications of the large k USp(2k) matrix model in
zero dimension. The model appears as the matrix model of type IIB superstrings
on a large $T^{6}/Z^{2}$ orientifold via the matrix twist operation. In the
small volume limit, the model behaves four dimensional and its T dual is
six-dimensional worldvolume theory of type I superstrings in ten spacetime
dimensions. Several theoretical considerations including the analysis on planar
diagrams, the commutativity of the projectors with supersymmetries and the
cancellation of gauge anomalies are given, providing us with the rationales for
the choice of the Lie algebra and the field content. A few classical solutions
are constructed which correspond to Dirichlet p-branes and some fluctuations
are evaluated. The particular scaling limit with matrix T duality
transformation is discussed which derives the F theory compactification on an
elliptic fibered K3.
