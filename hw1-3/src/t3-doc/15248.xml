<title>
Dynamics of $SU(N)$ Supersymmetric Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the physics of the Seiberg-Witten and
Argyres-Faraggi-Klemm-Lerche-Theisen-Yankielowicz solutions of $D=4$, $\CN=2$
and $\CN=1$ $SU(N)$ supersymmetric gauge theory. The $\CN=1$ theory is
confining and its effective Lagrangian is a spontaneously broken $U(1)^{N-1}$
abelian gauge theory. We identify some features of its physics which see this
internal structure, including a spectrum of different string tensions. We
discuss the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, identify a scaling regime in which
instanton and monopole effects survive, and give exact results for the
crossover from weak to strong coupling along a scaling trajectory. We find a
large hierarchy of mass scales in the scaling regime, including very light $W$
bosons, and the absence of weak coupling. The light $W$'s leave a novel imprint
on the effective dual magnetic theory. The effective Lagrangian appears to be
inadequate to understand the conventional large $N$ limit of the confining
$\CN=1$ theory.
