GRAVITY AND GLOBAL SYMMETRIES
</title>

<abstract>
  There exists a widely spread notion that gravitational effects can strongly
violate global symmetries. It may lead to many important consequences. We will
argue, in particular, that nonperturbative gravitational effects in the axion
theory lead to a strong violation of CP invariance unless they are suppressed
by an extremely small factor 10^{-82}. One could hope that this problem
disappears if one represents the global symmetry of a pseudoscalar axion field
as a gauge symmetry of the Ogievetsky-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric
tensor field. We will show, however, that this gauge symmetry does not protect
the axion mass from quantum corrections. The amplitude of gravitational effects
violating global symmetries could be strongly suppressed by e^{-S}, where S is
the action of a wormhole which may eat the global charge. Unfortunately, in a
wide variety of theories based on the Einstein theory of gravity the action
appears to be fairly small, S = O(10). However, we have found that the
existence of wormholes and the value of their action are extremely sensitive to
the structure of space on the nearly Planckian scale. We consider several
examples (Kaluza-Klein theory, conformal anomaly, R^2 terms) which show that
modifications of the Einstein theory on the length scale l ~ 10 M_P^{-1} may
strongly suppress violation of global symmetries. We have found also that in
string theory there exists an additional suppression of topology change by the
factor e^{-{8\pi^2\over g^2}}. This effect is strong enough to save the axion
theory for the natural values of the stringy gauge coupling constant.
