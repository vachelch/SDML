Pseudonatural Inflation
</title>

<abstract>
  We study how to obtain a sufficiently flat inflaton potential that is natural
from the particle physics point of view. Supersymmetry, which is broken during
inflation, cannot protect the potential against non-renormalizable operators
violating slow-roll. We are therefore led to consider models based on
non-linearly realized symmetries. The basic scenario with a single
four-dimensional pseudo Nambu Goldstone boson requires the spontaneous breaking
scale to be above the Planck scale, which is beyond the range of validity of
the field theory description, so that quantum gravity corrections are not under
control. A nice way to obtain consistent models with large field values is to
consider simple extensions in extra-dimensional setups. We also consider the
minimal structures necessary to obtain purely four-dimensional models with
spontaneous breaking scale below M_P; we show that they require an approximate
symmetry that is supplemented by either the little-Higgs mechanism or
supersymmetry to give trustworthy scenarios.
