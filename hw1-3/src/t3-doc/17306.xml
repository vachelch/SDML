<title>
Curvature Dependence of Running Gauge Coupling and Confinement in
  AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct IIB supergravity (viewed as dilatonic gravity) background with
non-trivial dilaton and with curved four-dimensional space. Such a background
may describe another vacuum of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory or
strong coupling regime of (non)-supersymmetric gauge theory with (power-like)
running gauge coupling which depends on curvature. Curvature dependent
quark-antiquark potential is calculated where the geometry type of hyperbolic
(or de Sitter universe) shows (or not) the tendency of the confinement.
Generalization of IIB supergravity background with non-constant axion is
presented. Quark-antiquark potential being again curvature-dependent has a
possibility to produce the standard area law for large separations.
