Nonsupersymmetric String Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We begin a search for nonsupersymmetric/supersymmetric dual string pairs by
constructing candidate critical nonsupersymmetric strings as solitons in
supersymmetric string theories. Using orbifold techniques, one can construct
cosmic string solutions which lie in supersymmetric vacua but which do not fall
in supermultiplets. We discuss two three-dimensional examples in detail. The
effective worldsheet actions for the soliton strings have (0,2) and (1,1)
supersymmetry and the correct numbers of massless bosons and fermions to be
critical heterotic and type II strings, respectively.
