Additive and Multiplicative Noise Driven Systems in 1+1 Dimensions:
  Waiting Time Extraction of Nucleation Rates
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the rate of true vacuum bubble nucleation numerically for a phi^4
field system coupled to a source of thermal noise. We compare in detail the
cases of additive and multiplicative noise. We pay special attention to the
choice of initial field configuration, showing the advantages of a version of
the quenching technique. We advocate a new method of extracting the nucleation
time scale that employs the full distribution of nucleation times. Large data
samples are needed to study the initial state configuration choice and to
extract nucleation times to good precision. The 1+1 dimensional models afford
large statistics samples in reasonable running times. We find that for both
additive and multiplicative models, nucleation time distributions are well fit
by a waiting time, or gamma, distribution for all parameters studied. The
nucleation rates are a factor three or more slower for the multiplicative
compared to the additive models with the same dimensionless parameter choices.
Both cases lead to high confidence level linear fits of ln(nucleation time) vs.
1/T plots, in agreement with semiclassical nucleation rate predictions.
