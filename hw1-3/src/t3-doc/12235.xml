Second Law of Black Hole Mechanics for all 2d Dilaton Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that all generalized two--dimensional dilaton theories with
arbitrary matter content (with a curvature independent coupling to gravity) do
not only obey a first law of black hole mechanics (which follows from Wald's
general considerations, if the entropy S is defined appropriately), but also a
second law: \delta S \ge 0 provided only that the null energy condition holds
and that, loosely speaking, for late times a stationary state is assumed. Also
any two-dimensional f(R)--theory is covered. This generalizes a previous proof
of Frolov [1] to a much wider class of theories.
