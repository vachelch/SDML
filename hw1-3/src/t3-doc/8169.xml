On the Arnold Conjecture and the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer Index Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  The Arnold conjecture yields a lower bound to the number of periodic
classical trajectories in a Hamiltonian system. Here we count these
trajectories with the help of a path integral, which we inspect using
properties of the spectral flow of a Dirac operator in the background of a
$\Sp(2N)$ valued gauge field. We compute the spectral flow from the
Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem, and apply the results to evaluate the path
integral using localization methods. In this manner we find a lower bound to
the number of periodic classical trajectories which is consistent with the
Arnold conjecture.
