AdS_2 D-Branes in Lorentzian AdS_3
</title>

<abstract>
  The boundary states for AdS_2 D-branes in Lorentzian AdS_3 space-time are
presented. AdS_2 D-branes are algebraically defined by twisted Dirichlet
boundary conditions and are located on twisted conjugacy classes of SL(2,R).
Using free field representation of symmetry currents in the SL(2,R) WZNW model,
the twisted Dirichlet gluing conditions among currents are translated to
matching conditions among free fields and then to boundary conditions among the
modes of free fields. The Ishibashi states are written as coherent states on
AdS_3 in the free field formalism and it is shown that twisted Dirichlet
boundary conditions are satisfied on them. The tree-level amplitude of
propagation of closed strings between two AdS_2 D-branes is evaluated and by
comparing which to the characters of sl(2,R) Kac-Moody algebra it is shown that
only states in the principal continuous series representation of sl(2,R)
Kac-Moody algebra contributes to the amplitude and thus they are the only ones
that couple to AdS_2 D-branes. The form of the character of sl(2,R) principal
continuous series and the boundary condition among the zero modes are used to
determine the physical boundary states for AdS_2 D-branes.
