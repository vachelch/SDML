Universe Generation from Black Hole Interiors
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that scenarios in which the universe is born from the interior
of a black hole may not posses many of the problems of the Standard Big-Bang
(SBB) model. In particular we demonstrate that the horizon problem, flatness,
and the structure formation problem might be solved naturally, not necessarily
requiring a long period of cosmological inflation. The black hole information
loss problem is also discussed. Our conclusions are completely independent of
the details of general models.
