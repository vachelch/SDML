Hard Scattering in the M-Theory Dual for the QCD String
</title>

<abstract>
  Conventional superstring amplitudes in flat space exhibits exponential fall
off at wide angle in contrast to the power law behavior found in QCD. It has
recently been argued by Polchinski and Strassler that this conflict can be
resolved via String/Gauge duality. They carried out their analysis in terms of
strings in a deformed $AdS^5$ background. On the other hand, an equally valid
approach to the String/Gauge duality for 4-d QCD is based on M-theory in a
specific Black Hole deformation of $AdS^7 \times S^4$. We show that a very
natural extension to this phenomenologically interesting M-theory background
also gives the correct hard scattering power laws. In the Regge limit we extend
the analysis to show the co-existence of both the hard BFKL-like Pomeron and
the soft Pomeron Regge pole.
