Seiberg-Witten Curve for E-String Theory Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss various properties of the Seiberg-Witten curve for the E-string
theory which we have obtained recently in hep-th/0203025. Seiberg-Witten curve
for the E-string describes the low-energy dynamics of a six-dimensional (1,0)
SUSY theory when compactified on R^4 x T^2. It has a manifest affine E_8 global
symmetry with modulus \tau and E_8 Wilson line parameters {m_i},i=1,2,...,8
which are associated with the geometry of the rational elliptic surface. When
the radii R_5,R_6 of the torus T^2 degenerate R_5,R_6 --> 0, E-string curve is
reduced to the known Seiberg-Witten curves of four- and five-dimensional gauge
theories. In this paper we first study the geometry of rational elliptic
surface and identify the geometrical significance of the Wilson line
parameters. By fine tuning these parameters we also study degenerations of our
curve corresponding to various unbroken symmetry groups. We also find a new way
of reduction to four-dimensional theories without taking a degenerate limit of
T^2 so that the SL(2,Z) symmetry is left intact. By setting some of the Wilson
line parameters to special values we obtain the four-dimensional SU(2)
Seiberg-Witten theory with 4 flavors and also a curve by Donagi and Witten
describing the dynamics of a perturbed N=4 theory.
