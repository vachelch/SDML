Dependence of Variational Perturbation Expansions on Strong-Coupling
  Behavior. Inapplicability of delta-Expansion to Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that in applications of variational theory to quantum field theory it
is essential to account for the correct Wegner exponent omega governing the
approach to the strong-coupling, or scaling limit. Otherwise the procedure
either does not converge at all or to the wrong limit. This invalidates all
papers applying the so-called delta-expansion to quantum field theory.
