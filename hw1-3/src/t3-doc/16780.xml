Mirror Symmetry And Quantum Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, mirror symmetry is derived as T-duality applied to gauge systems
that flow to non-linear sigma models. We present some of its applications to
study quantum geometry involving D-branes. In particular, we show that one can
employ D-branes wrapped on torus fibers to reproduce the mirror duality itself,
realizing the program of Strominger-Yau-Zaslow in a slightly different context.
Floer theory of intersecting Lagrangians plays an essential role.
