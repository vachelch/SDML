Lattice Models with N=2 Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce lattice models with explicit N=2 supersymmetry. In these
interacting models, the supersymmetry generators Q^+ and Q^- yield the
Hamiltonian H={Q^+,Q^-} on any graph. The degrees of freedom can be described
as either fermions with hard cores, or as quantum dimers. The Hamiltonian of
our simplest model contains a hopping term and a repulsive potential, as well
as the hard-core repulsion. We discuss these models from a variety of
perspectives: using a fundamental relation with conformal field theory, via the
Bethe ansatz, and using cohomology methods. The simplest model provides a
manifestly-supersymmetric lattice regulator for the supersymmetric point of the
massless 1+1-dimensional Thirring (Luttinger) model. We discuss the
ground-state structure of this same model on more complicated graphs, including
a 2-leg ladder, and discuss some generalizations.
