Anyonic States in Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the canonical quantization of Chern-Simons theory in $2+1$
dimensions, minimally coupled to a Dirac spinor field. Gauss's law and the
gauge condition, $A_0 = 0$, are implemented by embedding the formulation in an
appropriate physical subspace. We find two kinds of charged particle states in
this model. One kind has a rotational anomaly in the form of arbitrary phases
that develop in $2\pi$ rotations; the other kind rotates ``normally''---i.e.,
charged states only change sign in $2\pi$ rotations. The rotational anomaly has
nothing to do with the implementation of Gauss's law. It is possible to
inadvertently produce these anomalous states in the process of implementing
Gauss's law, but it is also possible to implement Gauss's law without producing
rotational anomalies. Moreover, states with or without rotational anomalies
obey ordinary Fermi statistics.
