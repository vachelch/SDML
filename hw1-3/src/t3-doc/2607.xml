<title>
Critical Points of the Product of Powers of Linear Functions and
  Families of Bases of Singular Vectors
</title>

<abstract>
  The quasiclassical asymptotics of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation with
values in the tensor product of sl(2)- representations are considered. The
first term of asymptotics is an eigenvector of a system of commuting operators.
We show that the norm of this vector with respect to the Shapovalov form is
equal to the determinant of the matrix of second derivatives of a suitable
function. This formula is an analog of the Gaudin and Korepin formulae for the
norm of the Bethe vectors. We show that the eigenvectors form a basis under
certain conditions.
