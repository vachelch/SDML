Local D=4 Field Theory on $\kappa$--Deformed Minkowski Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the local D=4 field theory on $\kappa$--deformed Minkowski space
as nonlocal relativistic field theory on standard Minkowski space--time. For
simplicity the case of $\kappa$-deformed scalar field $\phi$ with the
interaction $\lambda \phi^{4}$ is considered, and the $\kappa$--deformed
interaction vertex is described. It appears that fundamental mass parameter
$\kappa$ plays a role of regularizing imaginary Pauli--Villars mass in
$\kappa$--deformed propagator.
