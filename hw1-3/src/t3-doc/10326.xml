Three-Point Functions at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We study 3-point functions at finite temperature in the closed time path
formalism. We give a general decomposition of the eight component tensor in
terms of seven vertex functions. We derive a spectral representation for these
seven functions in terms of two independent real spectral functions. We derive
relationships between the seven functions and obtain a representation of the
vertex tensor that greatly simplifies calculations in real time.
