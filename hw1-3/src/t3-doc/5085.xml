Extended form method of antifield-BRST formalism for topological quantum
  field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a concise method to construct a BRST invariant action for the
topological quantum field theories in the Batalin-Vilkovisky antifield
formalism. The BV action that is a solution for the master equation is directly
obtained by means of the extended forms that involve all the required ghosts
and antifields. The BV actions for the non-abelian $BF$ theories (in 4 and
higher dimensions) and the Chern-Simons theory are constructed by means of the
extended form method. An extension of the $BF$ theory in 4-dimensions to
include a ``cosmological term'' is also examined and the close connection with
the topological Yang-Mills theory is indicated.
