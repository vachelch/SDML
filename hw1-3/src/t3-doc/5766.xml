New Modular Hopf Algebras related to rational $k$ $\widehat {sl(2)}$
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Hopf link invariants for an appropriate set of finite
dimensional representations of $ U_q SL(2)$ are identical, up to overall
normalisation, to the modular S matrix of Kac and Wakimoto for rational $k$
$\widehat {sl(2)}$ representations. We use this observation to construct new
modular Hopf algebras, for any root of unity $q=e^{-i\pi m/r}$, obtained by
taking appropriate quotients of $U_q SL(2)$, that give rise to 3-manifold
invariants according to the approach of Reshetikin and Turaev. The phase factor
correcting for the `framing anomaly' in these invariants is equal to $ e^{- {{i
\pi} \over 4} ({ {3k} \over {k+2}})}$, an analytic continuation of the anomaly
at integer $k$. As expected, the Verlinde formula gives fusion rule
multiplicities in agreement with the modular Hopf algebras. This leads to a
proposal, for $(k+2)=r/m$ rational with an odd denominator, for a set of
$\widehat {sl(2)}$ representations obtained by dropping some of the highest
weight representations in the Kac-Wakimoto set and replacing them with lowest
weight representations. For this set of representations the Verlinde formula
gives non-negative integer fusion rule multiplicities. We discuss the
consistency of the truncation to highest and lowest weight representations in
conformal field theory.
