Unitarity Relations in c=1 Liouville Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the S-matrix of c=1 Liouville theory with vanishing cosmological
constant. We examine some of the constraints imposed by unitarity. These
completely determine (N,2) amplitudes at tree level in terms of the (N,1)
amplitudes when the plus tachyon momenta take generic values. A surprising
feature of the matrix model results is the lack of particle creation branch
cuts in the higher genus amplitudes. In fact, we show the naive field theory
limit of Liouville theory would predict such branch cuts. However, unitarity in
the full string theory ensures that such cuts do not appear in genus one (N,1)
amplitudes. We conclude with some comments about the genus one (N,2)
amplitudes.
