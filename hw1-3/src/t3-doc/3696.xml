<title>
Percolation and the existence of a soft phase in the classical
  Heisenberg model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the results of a numerical investigation of percolation properties
in a version of the classical Heisenberg model. In particular we study the
percolation properties of the subsets of the lattice corresponding to
equatorial strips of the target manifold ${\cal S}^2$. As shown by us several
years ago, this is relevant for the existence of a massless phase of the model.
Our investigation yields strong evidence that such a massless phase does indeed
exist. It is further shown that this result implies lack of asymptotic freedom
in the massive continuum limit. A heuristic estimate of the transition
temperature is given which is consistent with the numerical data.
