Sp(4,R)/GL(2,R) Matrix Structure of Geodesic Solutions for
  Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axion Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The constructed $Sp(4,R)/GL(2,R)$ matrix operator defines the family of
isotropic geodesic containing vacuum point lines in the target space of the
stationary D=4 Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton--axion theory. This operator is used
to derive a class of solutions which describes a point center system with
nontrivial values of mass, parameter NUT, as well as electric, magnetic,
dilaton and axion charges. It is shown that this class contains both particular
solutions Majumdar--Papapetrou--like black holes and massless asymptotically
nonflat naked singularities.
