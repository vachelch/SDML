Initial Conditions for Semiclassical Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Semiclassical approximation based on extracting a c-number classical
component from quantum field is widely used in the quantum field theory.
Semiclassical states are considered then as Gaussian wave packets in the
functional Schrodinger representation and as Gaussian vectors in the Fock
representation. We consider the problem of divergences and renormalization in
the semiclassical field theory in the Hamiltonian formulation. Although
divergences in quantum field theory are usually associated with loop Feynman
graphs, divergences in the Hamiltonian approach may arise even at the tree
level. For example, formally calculated probability of pair creation in the
leading order of the semiclassical expansion may be divergent. This observation
was interpretted as an argumentation for considering non-unitary evolution
transformations, as well as non-equivalent representations of canonical
commutation relations at different time moments. However, we show that this
difficulty can be overcomed without the assumption about non-unitary evolution.
We consider first the Schrodinger equation for the regularized field theory
with ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs. We study the problem of making a limit
to the local theory. To consider such a limit, one should impose not only the
requirement on the counterterms entering to the quantum Hamiltonian but also
the requirement on the initial state in the theory with cutoffs. We find such a
requirement in the leading order of the semiclassical expansion and show that
it is invariant under time evolution. This requirement is also presented as a
condition on the quadratic form entering to the Gaussian state.
