<title>
On N=2 low energy effective actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a Wilsonian action compatible with special geometry and higher
dimension N=2 corrections, and show that the holomorphic contribution F to the
low energy effective action is independent of the infrared cutoff. We further
show that for asymptotically free SU(2) super Yang-Mills theories, the infrared
cutoff can be tuned to cancel leading corrections to F. We also classify all
local higher-dimensional contributions to the N=2 superspace effective action
that produce corrections to the Kahler potential when reduced to N=1
superspace.
