Complete Wetting of Gluons and Gluinos
</title>

<abstract>
  Complete wetting is a universal phenomenon associated with interfaces
separating coexisting phases. For example, in the pure gluon theory, at $T_c$
an interface separating two distinct high-temperature deconfined phases splits
into two confined-deconfined interfaces with a complete wetting layer of
confined phase between them. In supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, distinct
confined phases may coexist with a Coulomb phase at zero temperature. In that
case, the Coulomb phase may completely wet a confined-confined interface.
Finally, at the high-temperature phase transition of gluons and gluinos,
confined-confined interfaces are completely wet by the deconfined phase, and
similarly, deconfined-deconfined interfaces are completely wet by the confined
phase. For these various cases, we determine the interface profiles and the
corresponding complete wetting critical exponents. The exponents depend on the
range of the interface interactions and agree with those of corresponding
condensed matter systems.
