Comment on Field Redefinitions in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We carry out field redefinitions in ten-dimensional Type IIB supergravity and
show that they do not give rise to any physical corrections to the holographic
renormalization group structure in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We in particular
show that the holographic Weyl anomaly of the N=4 SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory
does not change under the field redefinition of the ten-dimensional metric of
the form G_{MN} -> G_{MN}+\alpha R G_{MN}+\beta R_{MN}. These results are
consistent with the fact that classical supergravity represents the on-shell
structure of massless modes of superstrings, which should not change under
redefinitions of fields.
