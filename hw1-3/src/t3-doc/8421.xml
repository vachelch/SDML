Pseudoclassical description of higher spins in $2+1$ dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Pseudoclassical supersymmetric model to describe massive particles with
higher spins (integer and half-integer) in $2+1$ dimensions is proposed. The
quantization of the model leads to the minimal (with only one polarization
state) quantum theory. In particular, the Bargmann-Wigner type equations for
higher spins arise in course of the canonical quantization. The cases of spin
one-half and one are considered in detail. Here one gets Dirac particles and
Chern-Simons particles respectively. A relation with the field theory is
discussed. On the basis of the model proposed, and using dimensional reduction
considerations, a model to describe Weyl particles with higher spins in $3+1$
dimensions is constructed.
