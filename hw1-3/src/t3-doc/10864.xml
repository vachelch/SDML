<title>
Space-time Symmetry Transformations of Elementary Particles realized in
  Optics Laboratories
</title>

<abstract>
  The second-order differential equation describes harmonic oscillators, as
well as currents in LCR circuits. This allows us to study oscillator systems by
constructing electronic circuits. Likewise, one set of closed commutation
relations can generate group representations applicable to different branches
of physics. It is pointed out that polarization optics can be formulated in
terms of the six-parameter Lorentz group. This allows us to construct optical
instruments corresponding to the subgroups of the Lorentz groups. It is shown
possible to produce combinations of optical filters that exhibit
transformations corresponding to Wigner rotations and Iwasawa decompositions,
which are manifestations of the internal space-time symmetries of massive and
massless particles.
