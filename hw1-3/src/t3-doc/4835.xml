<title>
World-sheet Stability of (0,2) Linear Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that two-dimensional (0,2) gauged linear sigma models are not
destabilized by instanton generated world-sheet superpotentials. We construct
several examples where we show this to be true. The general proof is based on
the Konishi anomaly for (0,2) theories.
