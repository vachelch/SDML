<title>
Non-Supersymmetric Type I Strings with Zero Vacuum Energy
</title>

<abstract>
  We study open descendants of non-supersymmetric type IIB asymmetric (freely
acting) orbifolds with zero cosmological constant. A generic feature of these
models is that supersymmetry remains unbroken on the brane at all mass levels,
while it is broken in the bulk in a way that preserves Fermi-Bose degeneracy in
both the massless and massive (closed string) spectrum. This property remains
valid in the heterotic dual of the type II model but only for the massless
excitations. A possible application of these constructions concerns scenarios
of low-energy supersymmetry breaking with large dimensions.
