Supersymmetric Brane-Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present warped metrics which solve Einstein equations with arbitrary
cosmological constants in both in upper and lower dimensions. When the
lower-dimensional metric is the maximally symmetric one compatible with the
chosen value of the cosmological constant, the upper-dimensional metric is also
the maximally symmetric one and there is maximal unbroken supersymmetry as
well. We then introduce brane sources and find solutions with analogous
properties, except for supersymmetry, which is generically broken in the
orbifolding procedure (one half is preserved in two special cases), and analyze
metric perturbations in these backgrounds In analogy with the D8-brane we
propose an effective $(\hat{d}-2)$-brane action which acts as a source for the
RS solution. The action consists of a Nambu-Goto piece and a Wess-Zumino term
containing a $(\hat{d}-1)$-form field. It has the standard form of the action
for a BPS extended object, in correspondence with the supersymmetry preserved
by the solution.
