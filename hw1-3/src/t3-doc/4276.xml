Type I Superconductivity upon Monopole Condensation in Seiberg-Witten
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the confinement scenario in N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theory
near the monopole point upon breaking of N=2 supersymmetry by the adjoint
matter mass term. We confirm claims made previously that the
Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string near the monopole point fails to be a BPS state
once next-to-leading corrections in the adjoint mass parameter taken into
account. Our results shows that type I superconductivity arises upon monopole
condensation. This conclusion allows us to make qualitative predictions on the
structure of the hadron mass spectrum near the monopole point.
