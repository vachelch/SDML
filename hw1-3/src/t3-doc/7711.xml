Classical Mechanics and kappa-symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we analyze two local extensions of a model introduced some time
ago to obtain a path integral formalism for Classical Mechanics. In particular,
we show that these extensions exhibit a nonrelativistic local symmetry which is
very similar to the well known kappa-symmetry introduced in the literature
almost 20 years ago. Differently from the latter, this nonrelativistic local
symmetry gives no problem in separating 1st from 2nd-class constraints.
