<title>
Strings in Curved Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  Progress on the physics of strings in curved spacetime are comprehensively
reviewed.We start by showing through renormalization group arguments that a
meaningful quantum theory of gravity must be finite and must include all
particle physics.Then, we review classical and quantum string propagation in
curved spacetimes.We start by the general expansion method proposed by de Vega
and S\'anchez in 1987. The particle transmutation phenomena in asymptotically
flat spacetimes are detailed including fermion-boson transitions in
supergravity backgrounds.The next chapters review the exactly solvable cases of
string propagation: shock waves, singular plane waves, conical spacetimes and
de Sitter cosmological spacetime. The calculation of various physical
quantities like the string mass and the energy-momentum tensor shows that
classical and quantum string propagation in shock-waves and singular plane
waves is physically meaningful and full of interesting new phenomena.The
important phenomenom of {\bf string stretching} that takes place when strings
fall into spacetime singularities and in expanding universes is analyzed.We
conclude by reporting on strings in de Sitter spacetime, where the string
equations are integrable and reduce to the sinh-Gordon equation and to
integrable generalizations of it. Lectures delivered at the ERICE SCHOOL
