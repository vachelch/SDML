Probing 4-Dimensional Nonsupersymmetric Black Holes Carrying D0- and
  D6-brane charges
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a 4-dimensional nonsupersymmetric black hole solution to low
energy type IIA string theory which carries D0- and D6-brane charges. For equal
charges this solution reduces to the one discussed recently by Sheinblatt. We
present a new parametrization of the solution in terms of four numbers which
reveals the underlying brane and antibrane structure of the black hole
arbitrarily far from extremality. In this parametrization, the entropy of the
general nonextremal black hole takes on a simple U-duality invariant form. A
Yang-Mills solution for the brane configuration corresponding to the extremal
case is constructed and a computation of the 1-loop matrix theory potential for
the scattering of a 0-brane probe off this brane configuration done. We find
that this agrees with the 1-loop potential obtained from a supergravity
calculation in the limit in which the ratio of the 0-brane to 6-brane charges
is large.
