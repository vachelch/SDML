Canonical structure and boundary conditions in Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The canonical structure of pure Yang-Mills theory is analysed in the case
when Gauss' law is satisfied identically by construction. It is shown that the
theory has a canonical structure in this case, provided one uses a special
gauge condition, which is a natural generalisation of the Coulomb gauge
condition of electrodynamics. The emergence of a canonical structure depends
critically also on the boundary conditions used for the relevant field
variables. Possible boundary conditions are analysed in detail. A comparison of
the present formulation in the generalised Coulomb gauge with the well known
Weyl gauge ($A_{0} = 0$) formulation is made. It appears that the Hamiltonians
in these two formulations differ from one another in a non-trivial way. It is
still an open question whether these differences give rise to truly different
structures upon quantisation. An extension of the formalism to include coupling
to fermionic fields is briefly discussed.
