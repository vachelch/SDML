Particle creation via relaxing hypermagnetic knots
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate that particle production for fermions coupled chirally to an
Abelian gauge field like the hypercharge field is provided by the microscopic
mechanism of level crossing. For this purpose we use recent results on zero
modes of Dirac operators for a class of localized hypermagnetic knots.
