U-duality from Matrix Membrane Partition Function
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse supermembrane instantons (fully wrapped supermembranes) by
computing the partition function of the three-dimensional supersymmetrical U(N)
matrix model under periodic boundary conditions. By mapping the model to a
cohomological field theory and considering a mass-deformation of the model, we
show that the partition function exactly leads to the U-duality invariant
measure factor entering supermembrane instanton sums. On the other hand, a
computation based on the quasi-classical assumption gives the non U-duality
invariant result of the zero-mode analysis by Pioline et al. This is suggestive
of the importance of supermembrane self-interactions and shows a crucial
difference from the matrix string case.
