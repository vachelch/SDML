Brane-Antibrane Constructions
</title>

<abstract>
  In type II string theories, we examine intersecting brane constructions
containing brane-antibrane pairs suspended between 5-branes, and more general
non-BPS constructions. The tree-level spectra are obtained in each case. We
identify various models with distinct physics: parallel brane-antibrane pairs,
adjacent pairs, non-adjacent pairs, and configurations which break all
supersymmetry even though any pair of branes preserves some supersymmetry. In
each case we examine the possible decay modes. Some of these configurations
turn out to be tachyon-free, stable non-BPS states. We use T-duality to map
some of our brane constructions to brane-antibrane pairs at ALE singularities.
This enables us to explicitly derive the spectra by the analogue of the quiver
construction, and to compute the sign of the brane-antibrane force in each
case.
