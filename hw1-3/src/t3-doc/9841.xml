<title>
The Quantization of the Chiral Schwinger Model based on the BFT-BFV
  formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply newly improved Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin Hamiltonian method to the
chiral Schwinger Model in the case of the regularization ambiguity $a>1$. We
show that one can systematically construct the first class constraints by the
BFT Hamiltonian method, and also show that the well-known Dirac brackets of the
original phase space variables are exactly the Poisson brackets of the
corresponding modified fields in the extended phase space. Furthermore, we show
that the first class Hamiltonian is simply obtained by replacing the original
fields in the canonical Hamiltonian by these modified fields. Performing the
momentum integrations, we obtain the corresponding first class Lagrangian in
the configuration space.
