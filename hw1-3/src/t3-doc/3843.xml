On Sibling and Exceptional W Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the physical spectrum for $W$ strings based on the algebras $B_n$,
$D_n$, $E_6$, $E_7$ and $E_8$. For a simply-laced $W$ string, we find a
connection with the $(h,h+1)$ unitary Virasoro minimal model, where $h$ is the
dual Coxeter number of the underlying Lie algebra. For the $W$ string based on
$B_n$, we find a connection with the $(2h,2h+2)$ unitary $N=1$ super-Virasoro
minimal model.
