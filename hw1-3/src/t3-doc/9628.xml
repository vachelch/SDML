<title>
Diagonalization of the XXZ Hamiltonian by Vertex Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We diagonalize the anti-ferroelectric XXZ-Hamiltonian directly in the
thermodynamic limit, where the model becomes invariant under the action of
affine U_q( sl(2) ).
  Our method is based on the representation theory of quantum affine
algebras, the related vertex operators and KZ equation, and thereby
bypasses the usual process of starting from a finite lattice, taking the
thermodynamic limit and filling the Dirac sea. From recent results on the
algebraic structure of the corner transfer matrix of the model, we obtain
the vacuum vector of the Hamiltonian. The rest of the eigenvectors are
obtained by applying the vertex operators, which act as particle creation
operators in the space of eigenvectors.
  We check the agreement of our results with those obtained using the Bethe
Ansatz in a number of cases, and with others obtained in the scaling limit
--- the $su(2)$-invariant Thirring model.
