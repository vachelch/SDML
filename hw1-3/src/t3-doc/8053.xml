Massless Thirring fermion fields in the boson field representation
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the boson field representation of the massless fermion fields,
suggested by Morchio, Pierotti and Strocchi in J. Math. Phys. 33, 777 (1992)
for the operator solution of the massless Thirring model, agrees completely
with the existence of the chirally broken phase in the massless Thirring model
revealed in EPJC 20, 723 (2001) and hep-th/0112183, when the free massless
boson fields are described by the quantum field theory, free of infrared
divergences in 1+1-dimensional space-time, formulated in hep-th/0112184 and
hep-th/0204237.
