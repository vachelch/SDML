<title>
The Heisenberg Matrix Formulation of Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Heisenberg's matrix formulation of quantum mechanics can be generalized to
relativistic systems by evolving in light-front time tau = t+z/c. The spectrum
and wavefunctions of bound states, such as hadrons in quantum chromodynamics,
can be obtained from matrix diagonalization of the light-front Hamiltonian on a
finite dimensional light-front Fock basis defined using periodic boundary
conditions in the light-front space coordinates. This method, discretized
light-cone quantization (DLCQ), preserves the frame-independence of the front
form even at finite resolution and particle number. Light-front quantization
can also be used in the Hamiltonian form to construct an event generator for
high energy physics reactions at the amplitude level. The light-front partition
function, summed over exponentially-weighted light-front energies, has simple
boost properties which may be useful for studies in heavy ion collisions. I
also review recent work which shows that the structure functions measured in
deep inelastic lepton scattering are affected by final-state rescattering, thus
modifying their connection to light-front probability distributions. In
particular, the shadowing of nuclear structure functions is due to destructive
interference effects from leading-twist diffraction of the virtual photon,
physics not included in the nuclear light-front wavefunctions.
