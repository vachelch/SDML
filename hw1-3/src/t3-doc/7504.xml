Hamiltonian Reduction and Classical Extended Superconformal Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a systematic construction of classical extended superconformal
algebras from the hamiltonian reduction of a class of affine Lie superalgebras,
which include an even subalgebra $sl(2)$. In particular, we obtain the doubly
extended $N=4$ superconformal algebra $\tilde{A}_{\gamma}$ from the hamiltonian
reduction of the exceptional Lie superalgebra $D(2|1;\gamma/(1-\gamma))$. We
also find the Miura transformation for these algebras and give the free field
representation. A $W$-algebraic generalization is discussed.
