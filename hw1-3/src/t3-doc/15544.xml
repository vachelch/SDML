<title>
Braided Matrix Structure of the Sklyanin Algebra and of the Quantum
  Lorentz Group
</title>

<abstract>
  Braided groups and braided matrices are novel algebraic structures living in
braided or quasitensor categories. As such they are a generalization of
super-groups and super-matrices to the case of braid statistics. Here we
construct braided group versions of the standard quantum groups $U_q(g)$. They
have the same FRT generators $l^\pm$ but a matrix braided-coproduct $\und\Delta
L=L\und\tens L$ where $L=l^+Sl^-$, and are self-dual. As an application, the
degenerate Sklyanin algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the braided matrices
$BM_q(2)$; it is a braided-commutative bialgebra in a braided category. As a
second application, we show that the quantum double $D(\usl)$ (also known as
the `quantum Lorentz group') is the semidirect product as an algebra of two
copies of $\usl$, and also a semidirect product as a coalgebra if we use braid
statistics. We find various results of this type for the doubles of general
quantum groups and their semi-classical limits as doubles of the Lie algebras
of Poisson Lie groups.
