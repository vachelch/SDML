Diffeomorphism Invariant Integrable Field Theories and Hypersurface
  Motions in Riemannian Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss hypersurface motions in Riemannian manifolds whose normal velocity
is a function of the induced hypersurface volume element and derive a second
order partial differential equation for the corresponding time function
$\tau(x)$ at which the hypersurface passes the point $x$. Equivalently, these
motions may be described in a Hamiltonian formulation as the singlet sector of
certain diffeomorphism invariant field theories. At least in some (infinite
class of) cases, which could be viewed as a large-volume limit of Euclidean
$M$-branesmoving in an arbitrary $M+1$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the
models are integrable: In the time-function formulation the equation becomes
linear (with $\tau(x)$ a harmonic function on the embedding Riemannian
manifold). We explicitly compute solutions to the large volume limit of
Euclidean membrane dynamics in $\Real^3$ by methods used in electrostatics and
point out an additional gradient flow structure in $\Real^n$. In the
Hamiltonian formulation we discover infinitely many hierarchies of integrable,
multidimensional, $N$-component theories possessing infinitely many
diffeomorphism invariant, Poisson commuting, conserved charges.
