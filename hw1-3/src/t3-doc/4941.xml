Effective hamiltonians for $1/N$ expansion in two-dimensional QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the general structure of effective hamiltonians for systematic
$1/N$ expansion in QCD using the light-cone quantization. These are
second-quantized hamiltonians acting on the Fock space of mesons and glueballs
defined by the solution of the $N=\infty$ problem. In the two-dimensional case
we find only cubic and quartic interaction terms, and give explicit expressions
for the vertex functions as integrals of solutions of 't Hooft equation. As
examples of possible applications of our formalism, we study $1/N$ corrections
to meson mass and form factors for decays of $Q\bar{q}$ states, recently
discussed by Grinstein and Mende in the large-$N$ limit. We find that $1/N$ is
a good small expansion parameter.
