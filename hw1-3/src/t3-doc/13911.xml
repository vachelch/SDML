<title>
BRST cohomology of the Chapline-Manton model
</title>

<abstract>
  We completely compute the local BRST cohomology $H(s|d)$ of the combined
Yang-Mills-2-form system coupled through the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons term
("Chapline-Manton model"). We consider the case of a simple gauge group and
explicitely include in the analysis the sources for the BRST variations of
the fields ("antifields"). We show that there is an antifield independent
representative in each cohomological class of $H(s|d)$ at ghost number 0 or
1. Accordingly, any counterterm may be assumed to preserve the gauge
symmetries. Similarly, there is no new candidate anomaly beside those already
considered in the literature, even when one takes the antifields into
account. We then characterize explicitly all the non-trivial solutions of the
Wess-Zumino consistency conditions. In particular, we provide a cohomological
interpretation of the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism.
