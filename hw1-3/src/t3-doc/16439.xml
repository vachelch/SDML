<title>
Anomalous Supersymmetry Breaking by Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that instantons violate a supersymmetric identity in a classically
supersymmetric Higgs model with no massless fermions. This anomalous breaking
arises because the correct perturbative expansion in the instanton sector is
not supersymmetric. The attempt to construct a manifestly supersymmetric
expansion generates infra-red divergences.
