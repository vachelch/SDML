Inhomogeneous quantum groups IGL_{q,r}(N): Universal enveloping algebra
  and differential calculus
</title>

<abstract>
       A  review of the multiparametric linear quantum group
GL_qr(N), its real forms, its dual algebra U(gl_qr(N)) and its
bicovariant differential calculus is given in the
first part of the paper.
      We then construct the (multiparametric) linear
inhomogeneous quantum group IGL_qr(N) as a projection from
GL_qr(N+1), or equivalently, as a quotient of GL_qr(N+1) with
respect to a suitable Hopf algebra ideal.
      A bicovariant differential calculus on IGL_qr(N) is explicitly
obtained as a projection from the one on GL_qr(N+1).
Our procedure unifies in a single structure the quantum
plane coordinates and the q-group matrix elements T^a_b,
and allows to deduce without effort the differential
calculus on the q-plane IGL_qr(N) / GL_qr(N).
      The general theory is illustrated on the example of IGL_qr(2).
