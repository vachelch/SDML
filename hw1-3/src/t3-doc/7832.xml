Canonical Transformations and Gauge Fixing in the Triplectic
  Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the generators of canonical transformations in the triplectic
manifold must satisfy constraints that have no parallel in the usual field
antifield quantization. A general form for these transformations is presented.
Then we consider gauge fixing by means of canonical transformations in this
Sp(2) covariant scheme, finding a relation between generators and gauge fixing
functions. The existence of a wide class of solutions to this relation nicely
reflects the large freedom of the gauge fixing process in the triplectic
quantization. Some solutions for the generators are discussed. Our results are
then illustrated by the example of Yang Mills theory.
