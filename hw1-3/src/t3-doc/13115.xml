<title>
Asymptotic Form of Zero Energy Wave Functions in Supersymmetric Matrix
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the power law decay, and asymptotic form, of SU(2) x Spin(d)
invariant wave-functions which are zero-modes of all s_d=2(d-1) supercharges of
reduced (d+1)-dimensional supersymmetric SU(2) Yang Mills theory, resp. of the
SU(2)-matrix model related to supermembranes in d+2 dimensions.
