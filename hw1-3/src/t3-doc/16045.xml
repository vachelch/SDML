<title>
N=2-Maxwell-Chern-Simons model with anomalous magnetic moment coupling
  via dimensional reduction
</title>

<abstract>
  An N=1--supersymmetric version of the Cremmer-Scherk-Kalb-Ramond model with
non-minimal coupling to matter is built up both in terms of superfields and in
a component-field formalism. By adopting a dimensional reduction procedure, the
N=2--D=3 counterpart of the model comes out, with two main features: a genuine
(diagonal) Chern-Simons term and an anomalous magnetic moment coupling between
matter and the gauge potential.
