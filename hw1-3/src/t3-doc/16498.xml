Topological Strings with Scaling Violation and Toda Lattice Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
We show that there is a series of topological string theories whose integrable
structure is described by the Toda lattice hierarchy. The monodromy group of
the Frobenius manifold for the matter sector is an extension of the affine Weyl
group $\widetilde W (A_N^{(1)})$ introduced by Dubrovin. These models are
generalizations of the topological $CP^1$ string theory with scaling violation.
The logarithmic Hamiltonians generate flows for the puncture operator and its
descendants. We derive the string equation from the constraints on the Lax and
the Orlov operators. The constraints are of different type from those for the
$c=1$ string theory. Higher genus expansion is obtained by considering the Lax
operator in matrix form.
