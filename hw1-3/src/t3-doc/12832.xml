<title>
Unification of gauge couplings in Kaluza-Klein theory with two internal
  manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a Kaluza-Klein theory whose ground state is ${\bf R}^4 \times
{\bf M } \times {\bf K}$ where ${\bf M}$ and ${\bf K}$ are compact,
irreducible, homogenous internal mani folds. This is the simplest ground state
compatible with the existence of the graviton, gauge fields, massless scalar
fields and the absence of the cosmological constan t. The requirement for these
conditions to be satisfied are the odd dimensionality of ${\bf M}$ and ${\bf
K}$, and the choice of a dimensionally continued Euler form action whose
dimension is the same as the dimension of ${\bf M} \times {\bf K}$. We show
that in such a theory, which is not simple due to presence of two internal
manifolds, the gauge couplings $g^2_M$ and $g^2_K$ are actually unified
provided that the internal space sizes are constant. For ${\bf M} \times {\bf
K} = S^{2m+ 1} \times S^{2k+1}$ this gauge coupling unification relation reads
$g^2_M / g^2_K = m / k$.
