Quantum Corrections to the Schwarzschild and Kerr Metrics
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the corrections to the lowest order gravitational interactions of
massive particles arising from gravitational radiative corrections. We show how
the masslessness of the graviton and the gravitational self interactions imply
the presence of nonanalytic pieces sqrt{-q^2}, ln-q^2, etc. in the form factors
of the energy-momentum tensor and that these correspond to long range
modifications of the metric tensor g_{\mu\nu} of the form G^2m^2/r^2,
G^2m\hbar/r^3, etc. The former coincide with well known solutions from
classical general relativity, while the latter represent new quantum mechanical
effects, whose strength and form is necessitated by the low energy quantum
nature of the general relativity. We use these results to define a running
gravitational charge.
