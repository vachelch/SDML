Matrix Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Four and five dimensional extremal black holes with nonzero entropy have
simple presentations in M-theory as gravitational waves bound to configurations
of intersecting M-branes. We discuss realizations of these objects in matrix
models of M-theory, investigate the properties of zero-brane probes, and
propose a measure of their internal density. A scenario for black hole dynamics
is presented.
