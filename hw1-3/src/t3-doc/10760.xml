<title>
Ultramicro Black Holes and Finiteness of the Electromagnetic
  Contribution to the Electron Mass
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that the nonintegrably singular energy density of the electron's
electromagnetic field (in both the classical point-charge model and quantum
electrodynamics) must entail very strong self-gravitational effects, which, via
black hole phenomena at finite radii, could well cut off the otherwise infinite
electromagnetic contribution to the electron's mass. The general- relativistic
equations for static, spherically symmetric stellar structure are specialized
to treat the self-gravitational effects of static, spheri- cally symmetric,
nonnegative, localized energy densities which may exhibit nonintegrable
singularities at zero radius. It is demonstrated that in many situations,
including the electromagnetic ones of interest here, such a system has a black
hole whose Schwarzschild radius is that where the original energy per radial
distance (the spherical shell area times the original energy density) reaches
the inverse of (2G). The total mass of the system is that of this black hole
(which follows in the usual way from its Schwarz- schild radius) plus the
integrated original energy density outside this black hole. These results
produce, for the classical point-charge model of the electron, an electrostatic
contribution to its mass which is many orders of magnitude larger than its
measured mass. For quantum electrodynamics, how- ever, the result is an
electromagnetic mass contribution which is approxi- mately equal to its bare
mass -- thus about half of its measured mass.
