Modified Star-Products Beyond the Large-B Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  Derivative corrections to the Wess--Zumino couplings of open-string effective
actions are computed at all orders in derivatives, taking the open-string
metric into account. This leads to a set of deformed star-products beyond the
Seiberg--Witten limit, and allows to reinterpret the couplings in terms of a
deformed integration prescription along a Wilson line in the non-commutative
set-up. Moreover, the recursive definition of the star-products induces
deformations of U(1) non-commutative Yang--Mills theory.
