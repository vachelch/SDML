Non-commutative D- and M-brane Bound States
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze certain brane bound states in M-theory and their descendants in
type IIA string theory, all involving 3-form or 2-form background fluxes. Among
them are configurations which represent NCYM, NCOS and ODp-theories in the
scaling limit of OM-theory. In particular, we show how the conditions for the
embedding to preserve supersymmetry are modified by the presence of the flux
and discuss their relations for the various different bound states. Via the
formalism of geometric quantization such a deformation of a supersymmetric
cycle is related to a non-commutativity of its coordinates. We also study
possible non-commutative deformations of the Seiberg-Witten curve of N=2
supersymmetric gauge theories due to non-trivial H-flux.
