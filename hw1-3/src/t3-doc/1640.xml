Schwinger-Dyson = Wheeler-DeWitt: gauge theory observables as bulk
  operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the second-order gauge-invariant Schwinger-Dyson operator of a
gauge theory is the Wheeler-DeWitt operator in the dual string theory. Using
this identification, we construct a set of operators in the gauge theory that
correspond to excitations of gravity in the bulk. We show that these gauge
theory operators have the expected properties for describing the semiclassical
local gravity theory.
