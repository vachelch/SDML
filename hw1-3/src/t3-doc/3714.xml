Many-Brane Extention of the Randall-Sundrum Solution
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, Randall and Sundrum proposed a static solution to Einstein's
equations in five spacetime dimensions with two 3-branes located at the fixed
points of $S^1/Z_2$ to solve the hierarchy problem. We extend the solution and
construct static and also inflationary solutions to Einstein's equations in
five spacetime dimensions, one of which is compactified on $S^1$, with any
number of 3-branes whose locations are taken to be arbitrary. We discuss how
the hierarchy problem can be explained in our model.
