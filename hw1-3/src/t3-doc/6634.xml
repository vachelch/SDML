Finite Factorization equations and Sum Rules for BPS correlators in N=4
  SYM theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of exact non-renormalized extremal correlators of half-BPS operators
in N=4 SYM, with U(N) gauge group, is shown to satisfy finite factorization
equations reminiscent of topological gauge theories. The finite factorization
equations can be generalized, beyond the extremal case, to a class of
correlators involving observables with a simple pattern of SO(6) charges. The
simple group theoretic form of the correlators allows equalities between ratios
of correlators in N=4 SYM and Wilson loops in Chern-Simons theories at
k=\infty, correlators of appropriate observables in topological G/G models and
Wilson loops in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories. The correlators also obey
sum rules which can be generalized to off-extremal correlators. The simplest
sum rules can be viewed as large k limits of the Verlinde formula using the
Chern-Simons correspondence. For special classes of correlators, the saturation
of the factorization equations by a small subset of the operators in the large
N theory is related to the emergence of semiclassical objects like KK modes and
giant gravitons in the dual ADS \times S background. We comment on an
intriguing symmetry between KK modes and giant gravitons.
