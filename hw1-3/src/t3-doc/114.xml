A variational approach to the QCD wave functional:Dynamical mass
  generation and confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a variational calculation in the SU(N) Yang Mills theory in 3+1
dimensions. Our trial variational states are explicitly gauge invariant, and
reduce to simple Gaussian states in the zero coupling limit. Our main result is
that the energy is minimized for the value of the variational parameter away
form the perturbative value. The best variational state is therefore
characterized by a dynamically generated mass scale $M$. This scale is related
to the perturbative scale $\Lambda_{QCD}$ by the following relation:
$\alpha_{QCD}(M)={\pi\over 4}{1\over N}$. Taking the one loop QCD $\beta$-
function and $\Lambda_{QCD}=150 Mev$ we find (for N=3) the vacuum condensate
${\alpha\over \pi}<F^2>= 0.008 Gev^4$.
