Generalization of the U_q(gl(N)) algebra and staggered models
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a technique of construction of integrable models with a Z_2
grading of both the auxiliary (chain) and quantum (time) spaces. These models
have a staggered disposition of the anisotropy parameter. The corresponding
Yang-Baxter Equations are written down and their solution for the gl(N) case
are found. We analyze in details the N=2 case and find the corresponding
quantum group behind this solution. It can be regarded as quantum
U_{q,B}(gl(2)) group with a matrix deformation parameter qB with (qB)^2=q^2.
The symmetry behind these models can also be interpreted as the tensor product
of the (-1)-Weyl algebra by an extension of U_q(gl(N)) with a Cartan generator
related to deformation parameter -1.
