<title>
Low-Energy Analysis of $M$ and $F$ Theories on Calabi-Yau Threefolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We elucidate the interplay between gauge and supersymmetry anomalies in
six-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity with generalized couplings between tensor
and vector multiplets. We derive the structure of the five-dimensional
supergravity resulting from the $S_1$ reduction of these models and give the
constraints on Chern-Simons couplings that follow from duality to $M$ theory
compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. The duality is supported only on a
restricted class of Calabi-Yau threefolds and requires a special type of
intersection form. We derive five-dimensional central-charge formulas and
discuss briefly the associated phase transitions. Finally, we exhibit
connections with $F$-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds that
admit elliptic fibrations. This analysis suggests that $F$ theory unifies
Type-$IIb$ three-branes and $M$-theory five-branes.
