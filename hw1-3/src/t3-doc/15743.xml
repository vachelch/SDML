<title>
Fermionic characters for graded parafermions
</title>

<abstract>
  Fermionic-type character formulae are presented for charged
irreduciblemodules of the graded parafermionic conformal field theory
associated to the coset $osp(1,2)_k/u(1)$. This is obtained by counting the
weakly ordered `partitions' subject to the graded $Z_k$ exclusion principle.
The bosonic form of the characters is also presented.
