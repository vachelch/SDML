3D Ising Model:The Scaling Equation of State
</title>

<abstract>
  The equation of state of the universality class of the 3D Ising model is
determined numerically in the critical domain from quantum field theory and
renormalization group techniques. The starting point is the five loop
perturbative expansion of the effective potential (or free energy) in the
framework of renormalized $\phi^4_3$ field theory. The 3D perturbative
expansion is summed, using a Borel transformation and a mapping based on large
order behaviour results. It is known that the equation of state has parametric
representations which incorporate in a simple way its scaling and regularity
properties. We show that such a representation can be used to accurately
determine it from the knowledge of the few first coefficients of the expansion
for small magnetization. Revised values of amplitude ratios are deduced.
Finally we compare the 3D values with the results obtained by the same method
from the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion.
