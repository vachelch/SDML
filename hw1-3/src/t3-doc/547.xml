Miracles and complementarity in de Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we consider a scenario, consisting of a de Sitter phase
followed by a phase described by a scale factor $a(t)\sim t^{q}$, where
$1/3<q<1$, which can be viewed as an inflationary toy model. It is argued that
this scenario naively could lead to an information paradox. We propose that the
phenomenon of Poincar\'{e} recurrences plays a crucial role in the resolution
of the paradox. We also comment on the relevance of these results to inflation
and the CMBR.
