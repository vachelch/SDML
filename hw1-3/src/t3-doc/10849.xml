N=8 Supergravity in Central Charge Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new geometrical description of N=8 supergravity, using central
charge superspace. The essential properties of the multiplet, like self-duality
properties of the vectors or the non-linear sigma model structure of the
scalars, appear in a natural way in this formulation. We also present in detail
how to deduce from this geometrical formulation the supergravity
transformations as well as the equations of motion for the component fields in
order to compare them with the results already known and obtained in
formulations on the component level.
