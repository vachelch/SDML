Bulk Observers in Non-Factorizable Geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider five dimensional non-factorizable geometries where the transverse
dimension is bounded and the remaining (parallel) dimensions are not. We study
the construction of effective theories at distances much longer than the
transverse size. An observer unable to resolve the transverse direction can
only measure distances along the parallel dimensions, but the non-factorizable
geometry makes the length of a curve along the parallel dimension sensitive to
where on the transverse direction the curve lies. We show that long geodesics
that differ in their endpoints only by shifts along the transverse direction
all have the same length to within the observer's resolution. We argue that
this is the correct notion of distance in the effective theory for a bulk
observer. This allows us to present a consistent interpretation of what is
measured by observers that live either on a brane or in the bulk.
