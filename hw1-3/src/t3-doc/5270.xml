On the solitons of the Chern-Simons-Higgs model
</title>

<abstract>
  Several issues concerning the self-dual solutions of the Chern-Simons-Higgs
model are addressed. The topology of the configuration space of the model is
analysed when the space manifold is either the plane or an infinite cylinder.
We study the local structure of the moduli space of self-dual solitons in the
second case by means of an index computation. It is shown how to manage the
non-integer contribution to the heat-kernel supertrace due to the
non-compactness of the base space. A physical picture of the local coordinates
parametrizing the non-topological soliton moduli space arises .
