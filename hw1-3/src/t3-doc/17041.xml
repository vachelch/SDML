Monstrous String-String Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the general class of supersymmetry preserving orbifolds of
strong/weak Type IIA/heterotic dual pairs in six dimensions and below. A
unified treatment is given by considering compactification to two spacetime
dimensions and constructing orbifolds by subgroups of the Fischer-Greiss
monster, utilizing the moonshine results of Conway and Norton. Duality requires
nontrivial Ramond-Ramond fluxes on the Type IIA side which are localized at the
fixed points. Further orbifolding by (-1)^{F_L} gives examples of new four
dimensional N=2 Type IIA vacua which are not conformal field theory
backgrounds.
