BPS Z_k strings, string tensions and confinement in non-Abelian Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk we review some generalizations of 't Hooft and Mandelstam ideas
on confinement for theories with non-Abelian unbroken gauge groups. In order to
do that, we consider N=2 super Yang-Mills with one flavor and a mass breaking
term. One of the spontaneous symmetry breaking is accomplished by a scalar that
can be in particular in the representation of the diquark condensate and
therefore it can be thought as being itself the condensate. We analyze the
phases of the theory. In the superconducting phase, we show the existence of
BPS Z_k-strings and calculate exactly their string tension in a straightforward
way. We also find that magnetic fluxes of the monopole and Z_k-strings are
proportional to one another allowing for monopole confinement in a phase
transition. We further show that some of the resulting confining theories can
be obtained by adding a deformation term to N=2 or N=4 superconformal theories.
