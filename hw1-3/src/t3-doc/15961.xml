Superstring Threshold Corrections to Yukawa Couplings
</title>

<abstract>
  A general method of computing string corrections to the K\"ahler metric and
Yukawa couplings is developed at the one-loop level for a general
compactification of the heterotic superstring theory. It also provides a direct
determination of the so-called Green-Schwarz term. The matter metric has an
infrared divergent part which reproduces the field-theoretical anomalous
dimensions, and a moduli-dependent part which gives rise to threshold
corrections in the physical Yukawa couplings. Explicit expressions are derived
for symmetric orbifold compactifications.
