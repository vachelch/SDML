MINBU Distribution of Two Dimensional Quantum Gravity: Simulation Result
  and Semiclassical Analysis
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse MINBU distribution of 2 dimensional quantum gravity. New data of
R$^2$-gravity by the Monte Carlo simulation and its theoretical analysis by the
semiclassical approach are presented. The cross-over phenomenon takes place at
some size of the baby universe where the randomness competes with the smoothing
force of $R^2$-term. The dependence on the central charge $c_m$\ and on the
$R^2$-coupling are explained for the ordinary 2d quantum gravity and for
$R^2$-gravity. The $R^2$-Liouville solution plays the central role in the
semiclassical analysis. A total derivative term (surface term) and the infrared
regularization play important roles . The surface topology is that of a sphere.
