<title>
The Relation of Constraints on Particle Statistics for Different Species
  of Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  Quons are particles characterized by the parameter $q$, which permits smooth
interpolation between Bose and Fermi statistics; $q=1$ gives bosons, $q=-1$
gives fermions.
  In this paper we give a heuristic argument for an extension of conservation
of statistics to quons with trilinear couplings of the form $\bar{f}fb$, where
$f$ is fermion-like and $b$ is boson-like. We show that $q_f^2=q_b$. In
particular, we relate the bound on $q_{\gamma}$ for photons to the bound on
$q_e$ for electrons, allowing the very precise bound for electrons to be
carried over to photons. An extension of this argument suggests that all
particles are fermions or bosons to high precision.
