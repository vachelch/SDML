<title>
Domain walls of gauged supergravity, M-branes, and algebraic curves
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide an algebraic classification of all supersymmetric domain wall
solutions of maximal gauged supergravity in four and seven dimensions, in the
presence of non-trivial scalar fields in the coset SL(8,R)/SO(8) and
SL(5,R)/SO(5) respectively. These solutions satisfy first-order equations,
which can be obtained using the method of Bogomol'nyi. From an
eleven-dimensional point of view they correspond to various continuous
distributions of M2- and M5-branes. The Christoffel-Schwarz transformation and
the uniformization of the associated algebraic curves are used in order to
determine the Schrodinger potential for the scalar and graviton fluctuations on
the corresponding backgrounds. In many cases we explicitly solve the
Schrodinger problem by employing techniques of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics. The analysis is parallel to the construction of domain walls of
five-dimensional gauged supergravity, with scalar fields in the coset
SL(6,R)/SO(6), using algebraic curves or continuous distributions of D3-branes
in ten dimensions. In seven dimensions, in particular, our classification of
domain walls is complete for the full scalar sector of gauged supergravity. We
also discuss some general aspects of D-dimensional gravity coupled to scalar
fields in the coset SL(N,R)/SO(N).
