Massive vector trapping as a gauge boson on a brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a mechanism to trap massive vector fields as a photon on the
Randall-Sundrum brane embedded in the five dimensional AdS space. This
localization-mechanism of the photon is realized by considering a brane action,
to which a quadratic potential of the bulk-vector fields is added. We also
point out that this potential gives several constraints on the fluctuations of
the vector fields in the bulk space.
