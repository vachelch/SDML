Relation between Yang-Baxter and Pair Propagation Equations in 16-Vertex
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a relation between two integrability conditions, namely the
Yang-Baxter and the pair propagation equations, in 2D lattice models. While the
two are equivalent in the 8-vertex models, discrepancies appear in the
16-vertex models. As explicit examples, we find the exactly solvable 16-vertex
models which do not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equations.
