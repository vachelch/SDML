Vertex Operators for AdS3 Background With Ramond Ramond Flux
</title>

<abstract>
  In order to study vertex operators for the Type IIB superstring on AdS space,
we derive supersymmetric constraint equations for the vertex operators in
AdS3xS3 backgrounds with Ramond-Ramond flux, using Berkovits-Vafa-Witten
variables. These constraints are solved to compute the vertex operators and
show that they satisfy the linearized D=6, N=(2,0) equations of motion for a
supergravity and tensor multiplet expanded around the AdS3xS3 spacetime.
