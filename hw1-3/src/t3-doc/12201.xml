<title>
Large N Gauge Theories and Anti-de Sitter Bag Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a proposal of Maldacena one describes the large N limit of gauge
theories in terms of supergravity solutions on anti-de Sitter space. From this
point of view we discuss a possible scenario for quark confinement in gauge
theory by describing hadrons as strongly curved universes. In particular an
interpretation of black hole as a bag model in SQCD is discussed. One relates
the mystery of curvature singularities in classical general relativity with the
mystery of quark confinement. The AdS bag model is defined by computing the
probe membrane action in supergravity background. It naturally implies the
"Cheshire Cat bag" principle. The confining pressure in the MIT bag model is
related with the cosmological constant in the AdS bag model. The Skyrme model
is interpreted as an effective theory describing black holes.
