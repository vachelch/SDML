Fermion zero modes in N=2 supervortices
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the fermionic zero modes of BPS semilocal magnetic vortices in N=2
supersymmetric QED with a Fayet-Iliopoulos term and two matter hypermultiplets
of opposite charge. There is a one-parameter family of vortices with
arbitrarily wide magnetic cores. Contrary to the situation in pure
Nielsen-Olesen vortices, new zero modes are found which get their masses from
Yukawa couplings to scalar fields that do not wind and are non-zero at the
core. We clarify the relation between fermion mass and zero modes. The new zero
modes have opposite chiralities and therefore do not affect the net counting
(left minus right) of zero modes coming from index theorems but manage to evade
other index theorems the literature that count the total number (left plus
right) of zero modes in simpler systems.
