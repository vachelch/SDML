Can We Live on the Brane in Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter Black Hole?
</title>

<abstract>
  The model of d5 higher derivative (HD) gravity admitting Schwarzschild--anti
de Sitter Black Hole (S-AdS BH) as exact solution is considered. The surface
counterterms are added to the complete action, they are fixed by the condition
of finiteness of bulk AdS spacetime when brane goes to infinity. As a result
the brane (observable Universe) is defined dynamically in terms of d5 theory
parameters (brane tension is fixed). Brane radius is always bigger than horizon
radius and the 4d Universe itself could be static or inflationary. Natural
ganeralization of this model gives warped compactification (with dynamically
generated brane) in the next-to-leading order of AdS/CFT correspondence.
