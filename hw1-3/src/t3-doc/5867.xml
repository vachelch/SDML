PATH INTEGRAL BOSONIZATION OF THREE FLAVOUR QUARK DYNAMICS
</title>

<abstract>
  Chiral symmetry breaking due to instanton-produced fermion zero modes in the
confining vacuum is considered. Zero modes provide 'tHooft-type determinant
quark interaction, which is bosonized by introduction of auxiliary fields. For
three flavours this procedure becomes nontrivial and a method is suggested
which allows to derive effective Lagrangian for massless Nambu--Goldstone
modes.
