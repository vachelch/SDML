(Non-)Abelian Kramers-Wannier duality and topological field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a connection between duality and topological field theories. First,
2d Kramers-Wannier duality is formulated as a simple 3d topological claim (more
or less Poincar\'e duality), and a similar formulation is given for
higher-dimensional cases. In this form they lead to simple TFTs with boundary
coloured in two colours. Classical models (Poisson-Lie T-duality) suggest a
non-abelian generalization in the 2d case, with abelian groups replaced by
quantum groups. Amazingly, the TFT formulation solves the problem without
computation: quantum groups appear in pictures, independently of the classical
motivation. Connection with Chern-Simons theory appears at the symplectic
level, and also in the pictures of the Drinfeld double: Reshetikhin-Turaev
invariants of links in 3-manifolds, computed from the double, are included in
these TFTs. All this suggests nice phenomena in higher dimensions.
