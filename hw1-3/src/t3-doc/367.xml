<title>
Gauss decomposition of trigonometric R-matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  The general formula for the universal R-matrix for quantized nontwisted
affine algebras by Khoroshkin and Tolstoy is applied for zero central charge
highest weight modules of the quantized affine algebras. It is shown how the
universal R-matrix produces the Gauss decomposition of trigonomitric R-matrix
in tensor product of these modules. Explicit calculations for the simplest case
of $A_1^{(1)}$ are presented. As a consequence new formulas for the
trigonometric R-matrix with a parameter in tensor product of $U_q(sl_2)$-Verma
modules are obtained.
