<title>
Low-Energy Brane-World Effective Actions and Partial Supersymmetry
  Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  As part of a programme for the general study of the low-energy implications
of supersymmetry breaking in brane-world scenarios, we study the nonlinear
realization of supersymmetry which occurs when breaking N=2 to N=1
supergravity. We consider three explicit realizations of this supersymmetry
breaking pattern, which correspond to breaking by one brane, by one antibrane
or by two (or more) parallel branes. We derive the minimal field content, the
effective action and supersymmetry transformation rules for the resulting N=1
theory perturbatively in powers of kappa = 1/M_{Planck}. We show that the way
the massive gravitino and spin-1 fields assemble into N=1 multiplets implies
the existence of direct brane-brane contact interactions at order O(kappa).
This result is contrary to the O(kappa^2) predicted by the sequestering
scenario but in agreement with recent work of Anisimov et al. Our low-energy
approach is model independent and is a first step towards determining the
low-energy implications of more realistic brane models which completely break
all supersymmetries.
