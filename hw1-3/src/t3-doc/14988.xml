$1+1$-Dimensional Large $N$ QCD coupled to Adjoint Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider 1+1-dimensional QCD coupled to Majorana fermions in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group $SU(N)$. Pair creation of partons (fermion
quanta) is not suppressed in the large-$N$ limit, where the glueball-like bound
states become free. In this limit the spectrum is given by a linear \lc\ Schr\"
odinger equation, which we study numerically using the discretized \lcq. We
find a discrete spectrum of bound states, with the logarithm of the level
density growing approximately linearly with the mass. The wave function of a
typical excited state is a complicated mixture of components with different
parton numbers. A few low-lying states, however, are surprisingly close to
being eigenstates of the parton number, and their masses can be accurately
calculated by truncated diagonalizations.
