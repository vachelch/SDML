Quantum Mechanics of Charged Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We quantize the spherically symmetric sector of generic charged black holes.
Thermal properties are encorporated by imposing periodicity in Euclidean time,
with period equal to the inverse Hawking temperature of the black hole. This
leads to an exact quantization of the area (A) and charge (Q) operators. For
the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, $A=4\pi G \hbar (2n+p+1)$ and $Q=me$, for
integers $n,p,m$. Consistency requires the fine structure constant to be
quantized: $e^2/\hbar=p/m^2$. Remarkably, vacuum fluctuations exclude extremal
black holes from the spectrum, while near extremal black holes are highly
quantum objects. We also prove that horizon area is an adiabatic invariant.
