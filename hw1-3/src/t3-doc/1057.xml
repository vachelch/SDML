Extension of the N=2 Virasoro algebra by two primary fields of dimension
  2 and 3
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly construct the extension of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra by
two super primary fields of dimension two and three with vanishing u(1)-charge.
Using a super covariant formalism we obtain two different solutions both
consistent for generic values of the central charge c. The first one can be
identified with the super W_4-algebra - the symmetry algebra of the CP(3)
Kazama-Suzuki model. With the help of unitarity arguments we predict the
self-coupling constant of the field of dimension two for all super
W_n-algebras. The second solution is special in the sense that it does not have
a finite classical limit c->infinity and generic null fields appear. In the
spirit of recent results in the N=0 case it can be understood as a unifying N=2
super W-algebra for all CP(n) coset models. It does not admit any unitary
representation.
