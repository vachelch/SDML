<title>
Gaugeon Formalism for Spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger Gauge Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a gauge covariant formalism of the canonically quantized theory of
spin-3/2 Rarita-Schwinger gauge field. The theory admits a quantum gauge
transformation by which we can shift the gauge fixing parameter. The quantum
gauge transformation does not change the BRST charge. Thus, the physical
Hilbert space is trivially independent of the gauge fixing parameter.
