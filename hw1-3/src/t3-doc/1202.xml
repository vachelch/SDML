Moduli and Twisted Sector Dependence of Z_N x Z_M Orbifold Couplings
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the four point correlation function involving four twist fields for
arbitrary even dimensional Z_N x Z_M orbifold compactifications. Using
techniques from the conformal field theory the three point correlation
functions with twist fields are determined. Both the choice of the modular
background (compatible with the twists) and of the (higher) twisted sectors
involved are fully general. Our results turn out to be target space duality
invariant.
