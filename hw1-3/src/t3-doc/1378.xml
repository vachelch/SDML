<title>
Holography in Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  The AdS/CFT correspondence identifies the coordinates of the conformal
boundary of anti-de Sitter space with the coordinates of the conformal field
theory. We generalize this identification to theories formulated in superspace.
As an application of our results, we study a class of Wilson loops in N=4 SYM
theory. A gauge theory computation shows that the expectation values of these
loops are invariant under a local kappa-symmetry, except at intersections. We
identify this with the kappa-invariance of the associated string worldsheets in
the corresponding bulk superspace.
