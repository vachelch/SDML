EVOLUTION OF A STRING NETWORK IN BACKGROUNDS WITH ROLLING HORIZONS
</title>

<abstract>
We discuss the temporal variation of the equation of state of a classical
string network, evolving in a background in which the Hubble radius 1/H shrinks
to a minimum and then re-expands to infinity. We also present a method to look
for self-consistent non-vacuum string backgrounds, correponding to the
simultaneous solution of the gravi-dilaton backgrounds equations and of the
string equations of motion.
