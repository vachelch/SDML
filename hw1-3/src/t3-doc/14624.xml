On Chiral Symmetry Breaking in a Constant Magnetic Field in Higher
  Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  Chiral symmetry breaking in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a constant
magnetic field is studied in spacetimes of dimension D > 4. It is shown that a
constant magnetic field can be characterized by [(D-1)/2] parameters. For the
maximal number of nonzero field parameters, we show that there is an effective
reduction of the spacetime dimension for fermions in the infrared region D
$\to$ 1 + 1 for even-dimensional spacetimes and D $\to$ 0 + 1 for
odd-dimensional spacetimes. Explicit solutions of the gap equation confirm our
conclusions.
