Charged black holes in effective string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the qualitative new features of charged dilatonic black holes
which emerge when both the Yang-Mills and Gauss-Bonnet curvature corrections
are included in the effective action. We consider perturbative effects by an
expansion up to second order in the inverse string tension on the four
dimensional Schwarzschild background and determine the backreaction. We
calculate the thermodynamical functions and show that for magnetic charge above
a critical value, the temperature of the black hole has a maximum and goes to
zero for a finite value of the mass. This indicates that the conventional
Hawking evaporation law is modified by string theory at a classical level.
