<title>
Modified N=1 Green-Schwarz superstring with irreducible first class
  constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose modified action which is equivalent to N=1 Green-Schwarz
superstring and which allows one to realize the supplementation trick [26].
Fermionic first and second class constraints are covariantly separated, the
first class constraints (1CC) turn out to be irreducible. We discuss also
equations of motion in the covariant gauge for $\kappa$-symmetry. It is shown
how the usual Fock space picture can be obtained in this gauge.
