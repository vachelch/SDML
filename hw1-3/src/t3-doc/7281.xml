<title>
Self-duality in Generalized Lorentz Superspaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the notion of self-duality to spaces built from a set of
representations of the Lorentz group with bosonic or fermionic behaviour, not
having the traditional spin-one upper-bound of super Minkowski space. The
generalized derivative vector fields on such superspaces are assumed to form a
superalgebra. Introducing corresponding gauge potentials and hence covariant
derivatives and curvatures, we define generalized self-duality as the Lorentz
covariant vanishing of certain irreducible parts of the curvatures.
