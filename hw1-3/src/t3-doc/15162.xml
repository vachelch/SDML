<title>
Heat Kernel Coefficients for Chern-Simons Boundary Conditions in QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the four dimensional Euclidean Maxwell theory with a Chern-Simons
term on the boundary. The corresponding gauge invariant boundary conditions
become dependent on tangential derivatives. Taking the four-sphere as a
particular example, we calculate explicitly a number of the first heat kernel
coefficients and obtain the general formulas that yields any desired
coefficient. A remarkable observation is that the coefficient $a_2$, which
defines the one-loop counterterm and the conformal anomaly, does not depend on
the Chern-Simons coupling constant, while the heat kernel itself becomes
singular at a certain (critical) value of the coupling. This could be a
reflection of a general property of Chern-Simons theories.
