New Duality Transformations in Orbifold Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We find new duality transformations which allow us to construct the stress
tensors of all the twisted sectors of any orbifold A(H)/H, where A(H) is the
set of all current-algebraic conformal field theories with a finite symmetry
group H \subset Aut(g). The permutation orbifolds with H = Z_\lambda and H =
S_3 are worked out in full as illustrations but the general formalism includes
both simple and semisimple g. The motivation for this development is the
recently-discovered orbifold Virasoro master equation, whose solutions are
identified by the duality transformations as sectors of the permutation
orbifolds A(D_\lambda)/Z_\lambda.
