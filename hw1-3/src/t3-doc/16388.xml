<title>
Regularized Casimir energy for an infinite dielectric cylinder subject
  to light-velocity conservation
</title>

<abstract>
  The Casimir energy of a dilute dielectric cylinder, with the same
light-velocity as in its surrounding medium, is evaluated exactly to first
order in $\xi^2$ and numerically to higher orders in $\xi^2$. The first part is
carried out using addition formulas for Bessel functions, and no Debye
expansions are required.
