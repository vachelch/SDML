<title>
Realization of compact Lie algebras in K\"ahler manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  The Berezin quantization on a simply connected homogeneous K\"{a}hler
manifold, which is considered as a phase space for a dynamical system, enables
a description of the quantal system in a (finite-dimensional) Hilbert space of
holomorphic functions corresponding to generalized coherent states. The Lie
algebra associated with the manifold symmetry group is given in terms of
first-order differential operators. In the classical theory, the Lie algebra is
represented by the momentum maps which are functions on the manifold, and the
Lie product is the Poisson bracket given by the K\"{a}hler structure. The
K\"{a}hler potentials are constructed for the manifolds related to all compact
semi-simple Lie groups. The complex coordinates are introduced by means of the
Borel method. The K\"{a}hler structure is obtained explicitly for any unitary
group representation. The cocycle functions for the Lie algebra and the Killing
vector fields on the manifold are also obtained.
