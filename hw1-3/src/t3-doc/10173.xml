Topological Born-Infeld Actions and D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose that the effective field theories of certain wrapped D-branes are
given by topological actions based on Born-Infeld theory. In particular, we
present a Born-Infeld version of the Abelian Donaldson-Witten theory. We then
consider wrapping D3 branes on calibrated submanifolds and for the Calabi-Yau
four-fold case, discuss how the resulting theory could give rise to a
Born-Infeld version of the ampicheiral twisted N=4 super Yang-Mills topological
field theory.
