Testing spatial noncommutativiy via the Aharonov-Bohm effect
</title>

<abstract>
  The possibility of detecting noncommutative space relics is analyzed using
the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We show that, if space is noncommutative, the
holonomy receives non-trivial kinematical corrections that will produce a
diffraction pattern even when the magnetic flux is quantized. The scattering
problem is also formulated, and the differential cross section is calculated.
Our results can be extrapolated to high energy physics and the bound $\theta
\sim [ 10 {TeV}]^{-2}$ is found. If this bound holds, then noncommutative
effects could be explored in scattering experiments measuring differential
cross sections for small angles. The bound state Aharonov- Bohm effect is also
discussed.
