<title>
What unitary matrix models are not?
</title>

<abstract>
  We report results of two investigations of the double-scaling equations for
the unitary matrix models. First, the fixed area partition functions have all
positive coefficients only for the first four critical points. This implies
that the critical points at $k\ge5$ describe non-unitary continuum theories.
Secondly, we examine a conjectured connection to branched polymers, but find
that the scaling solutions of the unitary models do not agree with those of a
particular model describing branched polymers.
