<title>
Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics for String-Bits
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop possible versions of supersymmetric single particle quantum
mechanics, with application to superstring-bit models in view. We focus
principally on space dimensions $d=1,2,4,8$, the transverse dimensionalities of
superstring in $3,4,6,10$ space-time dimensions. These are the cases for which
``classical'' superstring makes sense, and also the values of $d$ for which
Hooke's force law is compatible with the simplest superparticle dynamics. The
basic question we address is: When is it possible to replace such harmonic
force laws with more general ones, including forces which vanish at large
distances? This is an important question because forces between string-bits
that do not fall off with distance will almost certainly destroy cluster
decomposition. We show that the answer is affirmative for $d=1,2$, negative for
$d=8$, and so far inconclusive for $d=4$.
