Ring Division Algebras, Self-Duality and Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that once octonions are formulated as soft Lie algebras, they may be
safely used and the non-associativity can be overcame. The necessary points
are: (a) Fixing the direction of action by introducing the \delta operator. (b)
Closing the \delta algebra by using structure functions f_{ijk} (\phi). (c)
Representation of the \delta algebra can be developed. The E or E(\phi) can be
found and their structure functions can be computed easily. There may be
different applications of soft seven sphere in physics. We have given two cases
where the ring division algebras occupies a special position. Self-duality and
Simple supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are two promising places where soft
seven sphere prove to be useful and essential.
