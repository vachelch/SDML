Dirac Operator on the Quantum Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a Dirac operator on the quantum sphere $S^2_q$ which is
covariant under the action of $SU_q(2)$. It reduces to Watamuras' Dirac
operator on the fuzzy sphere when $q\to 1$. We argue that our Dirac operator
may be useful in constructing $SU_q(2)$ invariant field theories on $S^2_q$
following the Connes-Lott approach to noncommutative geometry.
