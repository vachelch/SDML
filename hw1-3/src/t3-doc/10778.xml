M-theory description of 1/4 BPS states in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss BPS states preserving 1/4 supersymmetries of N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory as M2-branes holomorphically embedded and ending on
M5-branes. We use techniques in electrodynamics to find the M2-brane
configurations, and give some explicit examples. In case the M2-brane
worldsheet has handles, the worldsheet moduli of the M2-brane is constrained in
a discrete manner. Several aspects of multi-pronged strings in type IIB string
theory are beautifully reproduced in the M-theory description. We also discuss
the relation between the above construction and the D2-brane dynamics in type
IIA string theory.
