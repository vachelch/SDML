<title>
Integrable Time-Discretisation of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider Model
</title>

<abstract>
  An exactly integrable symplectic correspondence is derived which in a
continuum limit leads to the equations of motion of the relativistic
generalization of the Calogero-Moser system, that was introduced for the first
time by Ruijsenaars and Schneider. For the discrete-time model the equations of
motion take the form of Bethe Ansatz equations for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2
Heisenberg magnet. We present a Lax pair, the symplectic structure and prove
the involutivity of the invariants. Exact solutions are investigated in the
rational and hyperbolic (trigonometric) limits of the system that is given in
terms of elliptic functions. These solutions are connected with discrete
soliton equations. The results obtained allow us to consider the Bethe Ansatz
equations as ones giving an integrable symplectic correspondence mixing the
parameters of the quantum integrable system and the parameters of the
corresponding Bethe wavefunction.
