<title>
Quantum Field Theories with Symmetries in the Wilsonian Exact
  Renormalization Group
</title>

<abstract>
  The purpose of the present thesis is the implementation of symmetries in the
Wilsonian Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) approach. After recalling how the
ERG can be introduced in a general theory (i.e. containing both bosons and
fermions, scalars and vectors) and having applied it to the massless scalar
theory as an example of how the method works, we discuss the formulation of the
Quantum Action Principle (QAP) in the ERG and show that the Slavnov-Taylor
identities can be directly derived for the cutoff effective action at any
momentum scale. Firstly the QAP is exploited to analyse the breaking of
dilatation invariance occurring in the scalar theory in this approach. Then we
address SU(N) Yang-Mills theory and extensively treat the key issue of the
boundary conditions of the flow equation which, in this case, have also to
ensure restoration of symmetry for the physical theory. In case of a chiral
gauge theory, we show how the chiral anomaly can be obtained in the ERG.
Finally, we extend the ERG formulation to supersymmetric (gauge) theories. It
is emphasized regularization is implemented in such a way that supersymmetry is
preserved.
