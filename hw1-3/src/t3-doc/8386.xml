<title>
Universality of Correlation Functions in Random Matrix Models of QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the universality of the spectral correlation functions of a
QCD inspired random matrix model that consists of a random part having the
chiral structure of the QCD Dirac operator and a deterministic part which
describes a schematic temperature dependence. We calculate the correlation
functions analytically using the technique of Itzykson-Zuber integrals for
arbitrary complex super-matrices. An alternative exact calculation for
arbitrary matrix size is given for the special case of zero temperature, and we
reproduce the well-known Laguerre kernel. At finite temperature, the
microscopic limit of the correlation functions are calculated in the saddle
point approximation. The main result of this paper is that the microscopic
universality of correlation functions is maintained even though unitary
invariance is broken by the addition of a deterministic matrix to the ensemble.
