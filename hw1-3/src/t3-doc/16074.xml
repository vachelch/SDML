Comments on the M Theory Approach to N=1 SQCD and Brane Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the M theory approach of Witten to investigate N=1 SU($N_c$) SQCD with
$N_f$ flavors. We reproduce the field theoretical results and identify in M
theory the gluino condensate and the eigenvalues of the meson matrix. This
approach allows us to identify the constant piece of the effective field theory
coupling from which the coefficient of the one-loop $\beta$-function can be
identified. By studying the area of the M-theory five-brane we investigate the
stability of type IIA brane configurations. We prove that in a supersymmetric
setup there is no force between static D4-branes that end on NS five-branes.
The force in the case that there is a relative velocity between the branes is
computed. We show that at the regions of intersecting IIA branes the curvature
of the M theory five-brane is singular in the type IIA limit.
