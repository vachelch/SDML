Relativistic invariant Lie algebras for kinematical observables in
  quantum space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  A deformation of the canonical algebra for kinematical observables of the
quantum field theory in Minkowski space-time has been considered under the
condition of Lorentz invariance. A relativistic invariant algebra obtained
depends on additional fundamental constants M, L and H with the dimensions of
mass, length and action, respectively. In some limiting cases the algebra goes
over into the well-known Snyder or Yang algebras. In general case the algebra
represents a class of Lie algebras, that consists of simple algebras and
semidirect sums of simple algebras and integrable ones. Some algebras belonging
to this class are noninvariant under T and C transformations. Possible
applications of obtained algebras for descriptions of states of matter under
extreme conditions are briefly discussed.
