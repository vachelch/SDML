<title>
Classical and Quantum Nonultralocal Systems on the Lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  We classify nonultralocal Poisson brackets for 1-dimensional lattice systems
and describe the corresponding regularizations of the Poisson bracket relations
for the monodromy matrix . A nonultralocal quantum algebras on the lattices for
these systems are constructed.For some class of such algebras an
ultralocalization procedure is proposed.The technique of the modified
Bethe-Anzatz for these algebras is developed.This technique is applied to the
nonlinear sigma model problem.
