Strings in Time-Dependent Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We continue and extend our earlier investigation ``Strings in a
Time-Dependent Orbifold'' (hep-th/0204168). We formulate conditions for an
orbifold to be amenable to perturbative string analysis and classify the low
dimensional orbifolds satisfying these conditions. We analyze the tree and
torus amplitudes of some of these orbifolds. The tree amplitudes exhibit a new
kind of infrared divergences which are a result of some ultraviolet effects.
These UV enhanced IR divergences can be interpreted as due to back reaction of
the geometry. We argue that for this reason the three dimensional parabolic
orbifold is not amenable to perturbation theory. Similarly, the smooth four
dimensional null-brane tensored with sufficiently few noncompact dimensions
also appears problematic. However, when the number of noncompact dimensions is
sufficiently large perturbation theory in these time dependent backgrounds
seems consistent.
