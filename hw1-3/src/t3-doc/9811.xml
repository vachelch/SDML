Symmetries and String Field Theory in D=2
</title>

<abstract>
  (This talk was presented at the Third International Wigner Symposium on Group
Theory, Oxford, September, 1993.) Matrix models provides us with the most
powerful framework in which to analyze D=2 string theory, yet some of its
miraculous features, such as discrete states and $w(\infty)$, remain rather
obscure, because the string degrees of freedom have been removed. Liouville
theory, on the other hand, has all its string degrees of freedom intact, yet is
notoriously difficult to solve. In this paper, we present the second quantized
formulation of Liouville theory in D=2, where discrete states and $w(\infty)$
have a natural, field theoretic interpretation. We generalize the
non-polynomial closed string field theory, first developed by the author and
the Kyoto and MIT groups, to the D=2 case. We find that, in second quantized
field theory language, the rather mysterious features of matrix models have an
intuitively transparent interpretation, similar to standard gauge theory. Latex
