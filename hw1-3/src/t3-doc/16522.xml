On Geometric Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a geometrical notion of entropy, definable in flat space,
governs the first quantum correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking black hole
entropy. We describe two methods for calculating this entropy -- a
straightforward Hamiltonian approach, and a less direct but more powerful
Euclidean (heat kernel) method. The entropy diverges in quantum field theory in
the absence of an ultraviolet cutoff. Various related finite quantities can be
extracted with further work. We briefly discuss the corresponding question in
string theory.
