<title>
Einstein-Hilbert action on the brane for the bulk graviton
</title>

<abstract>
  We find new closed string couplings on Dp-branes for the bosonic string.
These couplings are quadratic in derivatives and therefore take the form of
induced kinetic terms on the brane. For the graviton in particular we find the
induced Einstein-Hilbert term as well as terms quadratic in the second
fundamental tensor. We comment on tachyon dependences of these brane-localized
couplings.
