<title>
Renormalization group and logarithmic corrections to scaling relations
  in conformal sector of 4D gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effective theory of the conformal factor near its infrared
stable fixed point.The renormalization group equations for the effective
coupling constants are found and their solutions near the critical point are
obtained, providing the logarithmic corrections to scaling relations.Some
cosmological applications of the running of coupling constants are briefly
discussed.
