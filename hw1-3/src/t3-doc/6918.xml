<title>
Interference Phenomenon for Different Chiral Bosonization Schemes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study, in the framework put forward by Siegel\cite{WS} and by Floreanini
and Jackiw\cite{FJ} (FJ), the relationship between different chiral
bosonization schemes (CBS). This is done in the context of the soldering
formalism\cite{MS}, that considers the phenomenon of interference in the
quantum field theory\cite{ABW}. We propose a field redefinition that discloses
the presence of a noton, a nonmover field, in Siegel's formulation for chiral
bosons. The presence of a noton in the Siegel CBS is a new and surprising
result, that separates dynamics from symmetry. While the FJ component describes
the dynamics, it is the noton that carries the symmetry contents, acquiring
dynamics upon quantization and is fully responsible for the Siegel anomaly. The
diagonal representation proposed here is used to study the effect of quantum
interference between gauged rightons and leftons.
