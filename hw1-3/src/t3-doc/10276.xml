<title>
Lorentz covariant spin two superspaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Superalgebras including generators having spins up to two and realisable as
tangent vector fields on Lorentz covariant generalised superspaces are
considered. The latter have a representation content reminiscent of
configuration spaces of (super)gravity theories. The most general canonical
supercommutation relations for the corresponding phase space coordinates
allowed by Lorentz covariance are discussed. By including generators
transforming according to every Lorentz representation having spin up to two,
we obtain, from the super Jacobi identities, the complete set of quadratic
equations for the Lorentz covariant structure constants. These defining
equations for spin two Heisenberg superalgebras are highly overdetermined.
Nevertheless, non-trivial solutions can indeed be found. By making some
simplifying assumptions, we explicitly construct several classes of these
superalgebras.
