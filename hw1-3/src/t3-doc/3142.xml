Induced Spin from the $ISO(2,1)$ Gauge Theory with the Gravitational
  Chern-Simons Term
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of $ISO(2,1)$ gauge theory, we consider $(2+1)$-dimensional
gravity with the gravitational Chern-Simons term (CST). This formulation allows
the `exact' solution for the system coupled to a massive point particle (which
is not the case in the conventional Chern-Simons gravity). The solution
exhibits locally trivial structure even with the CST, although still shows
globally nontrivialness such as the conical space and the helical time
structure. Since the solution is exact, we can say the CST induces spin even
for noncritical case of $\s+\al m\ne 0$.
