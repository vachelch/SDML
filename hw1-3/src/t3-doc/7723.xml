Noncommutative Gravity in two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We deform two-dimensional topological gravity by making use of its gauge
theory formulation. The obtained noncommutative gravity model is shown to be
invariant under a class of transformations that reduce to standard
diffeomorphisms once the noncommutativity parameter is set to zero. Some
solutions of the deformed model, like fuzzy AdS_2, are obtained. Furthermore,
the transformation properties of the model under the Seiberg-Witten map are
studied.
