<title>
Quantum Fluctuations and Irreversibility
</title>

<abstract>
  We study how the effects of quantum corrections lead to notions of
irreversibility and clustering in quantum field theory. In particular, we
consider the virtual ``charge" distribution generated by quantum corrections
and adopt for it a statistical interpretation. Then, this virtual charge is
shown to ($a$) describe a system where the equilibrium state is at its
classical limit ($\hbar \rightarrow 0$), ($b$) give rise to spatial diffusion
of the virtual cloud that decays as the classical limit is approached and ($c$)
lead to a scenario where clustering takes place due to quantum dynamics, and a
natural transition from a ``fractal" to a homogeneous regime occurs as
distances increase.
