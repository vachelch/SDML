Radiation from Accelerated Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  The radiation emitted by accelerated fundamental strings and D-branes is
studied within the linear approximation to the supergravity limit of string
theory. We show that scalar, gauge field and gravitational radiation is
generically emitted by such branes. In the case where an external scalar field
accelerates the branes, we derive a Larmor-type formula for the emitted scalar
radiation and study the angular distribution of the outgoing energy flux. The
classical radii of the branes are calculated by means of the corresponding
Thompson scattering cross sections. Within the linear approximation, the
interaction of the external scalar field with the velocity fields of the branes
gives a contribution to the observed gauge field and gravitational radiation.
