Electromagnetic Contributions to Lepton g-2 in a Thick Brane-World
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Standard Model fields living inside a thick four dimensional flat
brane embedded in a (possibly warped) five dimensional space-time and estimate
the electromagnetic corrections to the anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) of the
electron and muon by including virtual massive fermion and gauge boson states.
Constraints on the mass of the ``excited'' states (or thickness of the
brane-world) are obtained.
