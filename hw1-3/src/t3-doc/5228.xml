<title>
Two-logarithm matrix model with an external field
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the two-logarithm matrix model with the potential
$X\Lambda+\alpha\log(1+X)+\beta\log(1-X)$ related to an exactly solvable
Kazakov-Migdal model. In the proper normalization, using Virasoro constraints,
we prove the equivalence of this model and the Kontsevich-Penner matrix model
and construct the 1/N-expansion solution of this model.
