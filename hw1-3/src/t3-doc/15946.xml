<title>
Confinement in N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories and Model Building Tools
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a systematic approach to confinement in N=1 supersymmetric
theories. We identify simple necessary conditions for theories to confine
without chiral symmetry breaking and to generate a superpotential
non-perturbatively (s-confine). Applying these conditions we identify all N=1
theories with a single gauge group and no tree-level superpotential which
s-confine. We give a complete list of the confined spectra and superpotentials.
Some of these theories are of great interest for model building. We give
several new examples of models which break supersymmetry dynamically.
