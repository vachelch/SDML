No-Go Theorem for Horizon-Shielded Self-Tuning Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a simple no-go theorem relating to self-tuning solutions to the
cosmological constant for observers on a brane, which rely on a singularity in
an extra dimension. The theorem shows that it is impossible to shield the
singularity from the brane by a horizon, unless the positive energy condition
(rho+p >= 0) is violated in the bulk or on the brane. The result holds
regardless of the kinds of fields which are introduced in the bulk or on the
brane, whether Z_2 symmetry is imposed at the brane, or whether higher
derivative terms of the Gauss-Bonnet form are added to the gravitational part
of the action. However, the no-go theorem can be evaded if the three-brane has
spatial curvature. We discuss explicit realizations of such solutions which
have both self-tuning and a horizon shielding the singularity.
