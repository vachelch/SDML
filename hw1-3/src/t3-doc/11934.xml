Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories in 1 + 1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are considered in 1+1 dimensions.
Firstly physical mass spectra of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in 1+1
dimensions are evaluated in the light-cone gauge with a compact spatial
dimension. The supercharges are constructed in order to provide a manifestly
supersymmetric infrared regularization for the discretized light-cone approach.
By exactly diagonalizing the supercharge matrix between up to several hundred
color singlet bound states, we find a rapidly increasing density of states as
mass increases. Interpreting this limiting density of states as the
stringbehavior, we obtain the Hagedron temperature $\beta_H=0.676 \sqrt{\pi
\over g^2 N}$. Secondly we have examined the vacuum structure of supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories in 1+1 dimensions. SUSY allows only periodic boundary
conditions for both fermions and bosons. By using the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation for the weak coupling limit, we find that the vacuum energy
vanishes, and hence the SUSY is unbroken. Other boundary conditions are also
studied. The first part is based on a work in collaboration with Y. Matsumura
and T. Sakai. The second part is based on a work in collaboration with H. Oda
and T. Sakai.
