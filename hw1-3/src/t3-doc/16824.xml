Akns Hierarchy, Self-Similarity, String Equations and the Grassmannian
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper the Galilean, scaling and translational self--similarity
conditions for the AKNS hierarchy are analysed geometrically in terms of the
infinite dimensional Grassmannian. The string equations found recently by
non--scaling limit analysis of the one--matrix model are shown to correspond to
the Galilean self--similarity condition for this hierarchy. We describe, in
terms of the initial data for the zero--curvature 1--form of the AKNS
hierarchy, the moduli space of these self--similar solutions in the Sato
Grassmannian. As a byproduct we characterize the points in the Segal--Wilson
Grassmannian corresponding to the Sachs rational solutions of the AKNS equation
and to the Nakamura--Hirota rational solutions of the NLS equation. An explicit
1--parameter family of Galilean self--similar solutions of the AKNS equation
and the associated solution to the NLS equation is determined.
