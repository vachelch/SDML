<title>
The Gauge Hierarchy Problem and Higher Dimensional Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on an attempt to solve the gauge hierarchy problem in the framework
of higher dimensional gauge theories. Both classical Higgs mass and
quadratically divergent quantum correction to the mass are argued to vanish.
Hence the hierarchy problem in its original sense is solved. The remaining
finite mass correction is shown to depend crucially on the choice of boundary
condition for matter fields, and a way to fix it dynamically is presented. We
also point out that on the simply-connected space $S^2$ even the finite mass
correction vanishes.
