Finite Action in d5 Gauged Supergravity and Dilatonic Conformal Anomaly
  for Dual Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Gauged supergravity (SG) with single scalar (dilaton) and arbitrary scalar
potential is considered. Such dilatonic gravity describes special RG flows in
extended SG where scalars lie in one-dimensional submanifold of total space.
The surface counterterm and finite action for such gauged SG in three-, four-
and five-dimensional asymptotically AdS space are derived. Using finite action
and consistent gravitational stress tensor (local surface counterterm
prescription) the regularized expressions for free energy, entropy and mass of
d4 dilatonic AdS black hole are found. The same calculation is done within
standard reference background subtraction.
  The dilaton-dependent conformal anomaly from d3 and d5 gauged SGs is
calculated using AdS/CFT correspondence. Such anomaly should correspond to two-
and four-dimensional dual quantum field theory which is classically (not
exactly) conformally invariant, respectively. The candidate c-functions from d3
and d5 SGs are suggested. These c-functions which have fixed points in
asymptoticaly AdS region are expressed in terms of dilatonic potential and they
are positively defined and monotonic for number of potentials.
