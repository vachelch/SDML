Large-N Reduction, Master Field and Loop Equations in Kazakov-Migdal
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
  I study the large-N reduction a la Eguchi--Kawai in the Kazakov--Migdal
lattice gauge model. I show that both quenching and twisting prescriptions lead
to the coordinate-independent master field. I discuss properties of loop
averages in reduced as well as unreduced models and demonstrate those coincide
in the large mass expansion. I derive loop equations for the Kazakov--Migdal
model at large N and show they are reduced for the quadratic potential to a
closed set of two equations. I find an exact strong coupling solution of these
equations for any D and extend the result to a more general interacting
potential.
