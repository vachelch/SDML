<title>
Finite Soft Terms in String Compactifications with Broken Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the role of supersymmetry breaking soft terms that are present in
generalized Narain compactifications of heterotic string theory, in which local
supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, with gravitino masses being inversely
proportional to the radii of compact dimensions. Such compactifications and
their variants, are thought to be the natural application of the Scherk-Schwarz
mechanism to string theory. We show that in the case where this mechanism leads
to spontaneous breaking of N=4, d=4 local supersymmetry, the limit \kappa goes
to zero, yields a 2-parameter class of soft terms whose precise form are shown
to preserve the ultraviolet properties of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This
result is in broad agreement with that of the field theory Scherk-Schwarz
mechanism, as applied to N=1, d=10 supergravity coupled to super Yang-Mills,
although the detailed structure of the soft terms are different in general.
