<title>
Scalar Tensor Theories and Hadamard State Condition
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hadamard state condition is used to analyze the local constraints on the
two-point function of a quantum field conformally coupled to a background
geometry. Using these constraints we develop a scalar tensor theory which
controls the coupling of the stress-tensor induced by the two-point function of
the quantum field to the conformal class of the background metric. It is then
argued that the determination of the state-dependent part of the two-point
function is connected with the determination of a conformal frame. We comment
on a particular way to relate the theory to a specific conformal frame
(different from the background frame) in which the large scale properties are
brought into focus.
