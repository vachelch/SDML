Tachyon-free Non-supersymmetric Type IIB Orientifolds via
  Brane-Antibrane Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the rules to construct type IIB compact orientifolds in six and
four dimensions including D-branes and anti-D-branes. Even though the models
are non-supersymmetric due to the presence of the anti-D-branes, we show that
it is easy to construct large classes of models free of tachyons.
Brane-antibrane annihilation can be prevented for instance by considering
models with branes and antibranes stuck at different fixed points in the
compact space. We construct several anomaly-free and tachyon-free
six-dimensional orientifolds containing D9-branes and anti-D5-branes. This
setup allows to construct four-dimensional chiral models with supersymmetry
unbroken in the bulk and in some D-brane sectors, whereas supersymmetry is
broken (at the string scale) in some `hidden' anti-D-brane sector. We present
several explicit models of this kind. We also comment on the role of the
non-cancelled attractive brane-antibrane forces and the non-vanishing
cosmological constant, as providing interesting dynamics for the geometric
moduli and the dilaton, which may contribute to their stabilization.
