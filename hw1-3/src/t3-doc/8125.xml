Probing Some N=1 AdS/CFT RG Flows
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the results of probing the ten dimensional type IIB supergravity
solution corresponding to a renormalisation group flow of supersymmetric SU(n)
Yang-Mills theory from pure gauge N=4 to N=1 with two massless adjoint
flavours. The endpoint of the flow is an infrared fixed point theory, and
because of this simplicity of the theory, the effective Lagrangian for the
probe is very well-behaved, having no zeros or singularities in the tension,
and a smooth potential, all of which we exhibit. Specialising to the locus of
points where the potential vanishes, we also characterise a part of the Coulomb
branch of the N=1 theory. The simplicity of the gauge theory physics allows us
to isolate and emphasise a key holographic feature of brane probe physics which
has wider applications in the study of geometry/gauge theory duals.
