<title>
Enhancement of Supersymmetry Near 5d Black Hole Horizon
</title>

<abstract>
  Geometric Killing spinors which exist on AdS_{p+2} X S^{d-p-2} sometimes may
be identified with supersymmetric Killing spinors. This explains the
enhancement of unbroken supersymmetry near the p-brane horizon in d dimensions.
The corresponding p-brane interpolates between two maximally supersymmetric
vacua, at infinity and at the horizon. New case is studied here: p=0, d=5. The
details of supersymmetric version of the very special geometry are presented.
We find the area-entropy formula of the supersymmetric 5d black holes via the
volume of S^3 which depends on charges and intersection matrix.
