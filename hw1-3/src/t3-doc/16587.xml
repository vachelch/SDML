<title>
Dualities of the entropy bound
</title>

<abstract>
  I study the hypothetical thermodynamic system which saturates the so-called
Hubble entropy bound and show that it is invariant under the S- and T-dualities
of string theory as well as the interchanges of the eleventh dimension of
M-theory. I also discuss how unique the entropy bound is under the dualities
and some related issues.
