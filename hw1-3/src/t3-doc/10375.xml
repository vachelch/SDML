<title>
Waves, boosted branes and BPS states in M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Certain type II string non-threshold BPS bound states are shown to be related
to non-static backgrounds in 11-dimensional theory. The 11-d counterpart of the
bound state of NS-NS and R-R type IIB strings wound around a circle is a pure
gravitational wave propagating along a generic cycle of 2-torus. The extremal
(q_1,q_2) string with non-vanishing momentum along the circle (or infinitely
boosted black string) corresponds in D=11 to a 2-brane wrapped around 2-torus
with momentum flow along the (q_1,q_2) cycle. Applying duality transformations
to the string-string solution we find type IIA background representing a bound
state of 2-brane and 0-brane. Its lift to 11 dimensions is simply a 2-brane
finitely boosted in transverse direction. This 11-d solution interpolates
between a static 2-brane (zero boost) and a gravitational wave in 11-th
dimension (infinite boost). Similar interpretations are given for various bound
states involving 5-branes. Relations between transversely boosted M-branes and
1/2 supersymmetric non-threshold bound states 2+0 and 5+0 complement relations
between M-branes with momentum in longitudinal direction and 1/4 supersymmetric
threshold bound states 1+0 and 4+0. In the second part of the paper we
establish the correspondence between the BPS states of type IIB strings on a
circle and oscillating states of a fundamental supermembrane wrapped around a
2-torus. We show that the (q_1,q_2) string spectrum is reproduced by the
membrane BPS spectrum, determined using a certain limit. This supports the
picture suggested by Schwarz.
