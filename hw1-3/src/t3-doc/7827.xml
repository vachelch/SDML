<title>
XXZ spin chain in transverse field as a regularization of the
  sine-Gordon model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider here XXZ spin chain perturbed by the operator sigma^x (``in
transverse field'') which is a lattice regularization of the sine-Gordon model.
This can be shown using conformal perturbation theory. We calculated mass
ratios of particles which lie in a discrete part of the spectrum and obtained
results in accord with the DHN formula and in disagreement with recent
calculations in literature based on numerical Bethe Ansatz and infinite
momentum frame methods. We also analysed a short distance behavior of this
states (UV or conformal limit). Our result for conformal dimension of the
second breather state is different from the conjecture in [Klassen and Melzer,
Int. J. Mod. Phys. A8, 4131 (1993)] and is consistent with this paper for
other states.
