Updating QCD$_2$
</title>

<abstract>
We review two-dimensional QCD. The report contains: 
 1. Introduction. 
 2. QCD$_2$ as a field theory
   2.1 The $1/N$ expansion and spectrum, 2.2 Ambiguity in the self-energy
of the quark, 2.3 Polyakov--Wiegmann formula and gauge interactions, 
2.4 Strong coupling analysis, 2.5 A Lagrangian realization of the coset
construction, 2.6 Chiral interactions. 
 3. Pure QDC$_2$ and string theory,
   3.1 Introduction, 3.2 Wilson loop average and large-$N$ limit, 3.3 String
interpretation, 3.4 Collective coordinates approach, 3.5 Phase structure of
QCD$_2$, 
 4. Generalized QCD$_2$ and adjoint-matter coupling , 
   4.1 Introduction and motivation, 4.2 Scalar and fermionic matter coupling;
quantization 4.3 The Hagedorn transition; supersymmetry 4.4 Landau--Ginzburg 
description; spectrum and string theory 
 5. Algebraic aspects of QCD$_2$ and integrability 
   5.1 $W_\infty$ algebras for colourless bilinears 5.2 Integrability and
duality 5.3 Constraint structure of the theory 5.4 Spectrum and comparison
with the $1/N$ expansion 5.5 Integrability conditions and Calogero-type
models 5.6 QCD at high energies and two-dimensional field theory 
 6. Conclusions, 3 appendices.
