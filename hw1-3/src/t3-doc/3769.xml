Solving Topological Field Theories on Mapping Tori
</title>

<abstract>
  Using gauge theory and functional integral methods, we derive concrete
expressions for the partition functions of BF theory and the U(1|1) model of
Rozansky and Saleur on $\Sigma x S^{1}$, both directly and using equivalent
two-dimensional theories. We also derive the partition function of a certain
non-abelian generalization of the U(1|1) model on mapping tori and hence obtain
explicit expressions for the Ray-Singer torsion on these manifolds. Extensions
of these results to BF and Chern-Simons theories on mapping tori are also
discussed. The topological field theory actions of the equivalent
two-dimensional theories we find have the interesting property of depending
explicitly on the diffeomorphism defining the mapping torus while the quantum
field theory is sensitive only to its isomorphism class defining the mapping
torus as a smooth manifold.
