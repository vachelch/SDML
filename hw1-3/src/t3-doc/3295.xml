<title>
Phases and Residual Gauge Symmetries of Higgs Models
</title>

<abstract>
  After elimination of the redundant variables, gauge theories may still
exhibit symmetries associated with the gauge fields. The role of these residual
gauge symmetries is discussed within the Abelian Higgs model and the
Georgi-Glashow model. In the different phases of these models, these symmetries
are realized differently. The characteristics of emergence and disappearance of
the symmetries are studied in detail and the implications for the dynamics in
Coulomb, Higgs, and confining phases are discussed.
