Macdonald's polynomials and representations of quantum groups
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we present a formula for Macdonald's polynomials for the root
system A(n-1) which arises from the representation theory of quantum sl(n).
This formula expresses Macdonald's polynomials via (weighted) traces of
intertwining operators between certain modules over quantum sl(n). We also
describe the commutative system of Macdonald's difference operators using the
generators of the center of the quantum universal enveloping algebra, and use
this description to prove a trace formula for generic eigenfunctions of these
operators. These functions are generalized q-hypergeometric functions which are
related to solutions of the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.
