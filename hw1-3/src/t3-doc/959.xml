Braiding in Conformal Field Theory and Solvable Lattice Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Braiding matrices in rational conformal field theory are considered. The
braiding matrices for any two block four point function are computed, in
general, using the holomorphic properties of the blocks and the holomorphic
properties of rational conformal field theory. The braidings of $SU(N)_k$ with
the fundamental are evaluated and are used as examples. Solvable interaction
round the face lattice models are constructed from these braiding matrices, and
their Boltzmann weights are given. This allows, in particular, for the
derivation of the Boltzmann weights of such solvable height models.
