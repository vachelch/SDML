<title>
Adjoint non-Abelian Coulomb gas at large N
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-Abelian analog of the classical Coulomb gas is discussed. The
statistical mechanics of arrays of classical particles which transform under
various representations of a non-Abelian gauge group and which interact through
non-Abelian electric fields are considered. The problem is formulated on the
lattice and, for the case of adjoint charges, it is solved in the large N
limit. The explicit solution exhibits a first order confinement-de-confinement
phase transition with computable properties. In one dimension, the solution has
a continuum limit which describes 1+1-dimensional quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
with heavy adjoint matter.
