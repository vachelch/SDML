<title>
Extrinsic Hermitian Geometry of Functional Determinants for Vector
  Subbundles and the Drinfeld--Sokolov Ghost System
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, a novel method is presented for the study of the dependence of
the functional determinant of the Laplace operator associated to a subbundle
$F$ of a hermitian holomorphic vector bundle $E$ over a Riemann surface
$\Sigma$ on the hermitian structure $(h,H)$ of $E$. The generalized Weyl
anomaly of the effective action is computed and found to be expressible in
terms of a suitable generalization of the Liouville and Donaldson actions. The
general techniques worked out are then applied to the study of a specific
model, the Drinfeld--Sokolov (DS) ghost system arising in $W$--gravity. The
expression of generalized Weyl anomaly of the DS ghost effective action is
found. It is shown that, by a specific choice of the fiber metric $H_h$
depending on the base metric $h$, the effective action reduces into that of a
conformal field theory. Its central charge is computed and found to agree with
that obtained by the methods of hamiltonian reduction and conformal field
theory. The DS holomorphic gauge group and the DS moduli space are defined and
their dimensions are computed.
