<title>
D-brane effective field theory from string field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Open string field theory is considered as a tool for deriving the effective
action for the massless or tachyonic fields living on D-branes. Some simple
calculations are performed in open bosonic string field theory which validate
this approach. The level truncation method is used to calculate successive
approximations to the quartic terms \phi^4, (A^\mu A_\mu)^2 and [A_\mu,
A_\nu]^2 for the zero momentum tachyon and gauge field on one or many bosonic
D-branes. We find that the level truncation method converges for these terms
within 2-4% when all massive fields up to level 20 are integrated out, although
the convergence is slower than exponential. We discuss the possibility of
extending this work to determine the structure of the nonabelian Born-Infeld
theory describing the gauge field on a system of many parallel bosonic or
supersymmetric D-branes. We also describe a brane configuration in which
tachyon condensation arises in both the gauge theory and string field theory
pictures. This provides a natural connection between recent work of Sen and
Zwiebach on tachyon condensation in string field theory and unstable vacua in
super Yang-Mills and Born-Infeld field theory.
