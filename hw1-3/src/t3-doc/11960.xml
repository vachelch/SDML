Greybody factor for D3-branes in B field
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the effect of noncommutative spacetime on the greybody factor on
the supergravity side. For this purpose we introduce a system of D3-branes with
a constant NS $B$-field along their world volume directions ($x_2, x_3$).
Considering the propagation of minimally coupled scalar with non-zero momentum
along($x_2, x_3$), we derive an exact form of the greybody factor in $B$ field.
It turns out that $\sigma^{B\ne0}_l > \sigma^{B=0}_l$. This means that the
presence of $B$-field (the noncommutativity) suppresses the potential barrier
surrounding the black hole. As a result, it comes out the increase of greybody
factor.
