<title>
Self-Duality of a Topologically Massive Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider self-duality in a 2+1 dimensional gauge theory containing both
the Born-Infeld and the Chern-Simons terms. We introduce a Born-Infeld inspired
generalization of the Proca term and show that the corresponding self dual
equation is identical to that of the Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons theory.
