<title>
Anisotropy beta functions
</title>

<abstract>
  The flow of couplings under anisotropic scaling of momenta is computed in
$\phi^3$ theory in 6 dimensions. It is shown that the coupling decreases as
momenta of two of the particles become large, keeping the third momentum fixed,
but at a slower rate than the decrease of the coupling if all three momenta
become large simultaneously. This effect serves as a simple test of effective
theories of high energy scattering, since such theories should reproduce these
deviations from the usual logarithmic scale dependence.
