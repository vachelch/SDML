<title>
Quasi exactly solvable matrix models in sl(n)
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the quasi exactly solvable matrix models constructed recently
by R. Zhdanov. The 2$\times$2 matrix operators representing the algebra sl(2)
are generalized to matrices of arbitrary dimension and a similar construction
is achieved for the algebra sl(n).
