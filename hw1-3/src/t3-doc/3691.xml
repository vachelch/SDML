Brane Junctions in the Randall-Sundrum Scenario
</title>

<abstract>
  We present static solutions to Einstein's equations corresponding to branes
at various angles intersecting in a single 3-brane. Such configurations may be
useful for building models with localized gravity via the Randall-Sundrum
mechanism. We find that such solutions may exist only if the mechanical forces
acting on the junction exactly cancel. In addition to this constraint there are
further conditions that the parameters of the theory have to satisfy. We find
that at least one of these involves only the brane tensions and cosmological
constants, and thus can not have a dynamical origin. We present these
conditions in detail for two simple examples. We discuss the nature of the
cosmological constant problem in the framework of these scenarios, and outline
the desired features of the brane configurations which may bring us closer
towards the resolution of the cosmological constant problem.
