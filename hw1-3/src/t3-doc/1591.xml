Neutral Particles in Light of the Majorana-Ahluwalia Ideas
</title>

<abstract>
  The first part of this article (Sections I and II) presents oneself an
overview of theory and phenomenology of truly neutral particles based on the
papers of Majorana, Racah, Furry, McLennan and Case. The recent development of
the construct, undertaken by Ahluwalia [{\it Mod. Phys. Lett. A}{\bf 9} (1994)
439; {\it Acta Phys. Polon. B}{\bf 25} (1994) 1267; Preprints LANL
LA-UR-94-1252, LA-UR-94-3118], could be relevant for explanation of the present
experimental situation in neutrino physics and astrophysics.
  In Section III the new fundamental wave equations for self/anti-self
conjugate type-II spinors, proposed by Ahluwalia, are re-casted to covariant
form. The connection with the Foldy-Nigam-Bargmann-Wightman- Wigner (FNBWW)
type quantum field theory is found. The possible applications to the problem of
neutrino oscillations are discussed.
