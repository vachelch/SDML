Review of Open Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  I review the construction of an action for open superstring field theory
which does not suffer from the contact term problems of other approaches. This
action resembles a Wess-Zumino-Witten action and can be constructed in a
manifestly D=4 super-Poincar\'e covariant manner. This review is based on
lectures given at the ICTP Latin-American String School in Mexico City and the
Komaba 2000 Workshop in Tokyo.
