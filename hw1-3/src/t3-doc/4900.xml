New Features of the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt Lightcone Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  This is about new unexpected features of the Mandestam-Leibbrandt
prescription found as applied to spacelike Wilson lines. The regularization
parameter $ \omega $ in the M-L denominator for the spurious poles has to be
kept throughout the calculation till the very end or else the integrals do not
make sense. We get various `ambiguous' terms of the form $ \omega
^{-{\epsilon\over2}} \epsilon^{-2} $ which are not controlled by any sort of
Ward identity. These terms cancel out in the sum and the final result is
independent of $ \omega $. However, for the self energy on the spacelike Wilson
line we obtain an unexpected double pole at $ \epsilon=0 $, using dimensional
regularization in $ 4-\epsilon $ dimensions.
