String Partition Functions and Infinite Products
</title>

<abstract>
  We continue to explore the conjectural expressions of the Gromov-Witten
potentials for a class of elliptically and K3 fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds in the
limit where the base P^1 of the K3 fibration becomes infinitely large. At least
in this limit we argue that the string partition function (=the exponential
generating function of the Gromov-Witten potentials) can be expressed as an
infinite product in which the Kahler moduli and the string coupling are treated
somewhat on an equal footing. Technically speaking, we use the exponential
lifting of a weight zero Jacobi form to reach the infinite product as in the
celebrated work of Borcherds. However, the relevant Jacobi form is associated
with a lattice of Lorentzian signature. A major part of this work is devoted to
an attempt to interpret the infinite product or more precisely the Jacobi form
in terms of the bound states of D2- and D0-branes using a vortex description
and its suitable generalization.
