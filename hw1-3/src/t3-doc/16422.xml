Higher Spin N=8 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The product of two N=8 supersingletons yields an infinite tower of massless
states of higher spin in four dimensional anti de Sitter space. All the states
with spin s > 1/2 correspond to generators of Vasiliev's super higher spin
algebra shs^E (8|4) which contains the D=4, N=8 anti de Sitter superalgebra
OSp(8|4). Gauging the higher spin algebra and introducing a matter multiplet in
a quasi-adjoint representation leads to a consistent and fully nonlinear
equations of motion as shown sometime ago by Vasiliev. We show the embedding of
the N=8 AdS supergravity equations of motion in the full system at the
linearized level and discuss the implications for the embedding of the
interacting theory. We furthermore speculate that the boundary N=8 singleton
field theory yields the dynamics of the N=8 AdS supergravity in the bulk,
including all higher spin massless fields, in an unbroken phase of M-theory.
