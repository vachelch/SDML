<title>
Simple field theoretical models on noncommutative manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We review recent progress in formulating two-dimensional models over
noncommutative manifolds where the space-time coordinates enter in the
formalism as non-commuting matrices. We describe the Fuzzy sphere and a way to
approximate topological nontrivial configurations using matrix models. We
obtain an ultraviolet cut off procedure, which respects the symmetries of the
model. The treatment of spinors results from a supersymmetric formulation; our
cut off procedure preserves even the supersymmetry.
