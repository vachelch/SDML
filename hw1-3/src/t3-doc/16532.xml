From 0-Branes to Torons
</title>

<abstract>
  The moduli space of 0-branes on $T^4$ gives a prediction for the moduli space
of torons in U(n) Super Yang Mills theory which preserve 16 supersymmetries.
The zero brane number corresponds to the greatest common denominator of the
rank $n$, magnetic fluxes and the instanton number. This prediction is derived
using U-duality. We explicitly check this prediction by analyzing U(n) bundles
with non-zero first as well as second Chern classes. The argument is extended
to deduce the moduli space of torons which preserve 8 supersymmetries. Parts of
the discussion extend naturally to $T^2$ and $T^3$. Some of the U-dualities
involved are related to Lorentz boosts along the eleventh direction in M
theory.
