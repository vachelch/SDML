<title>
The Standard Model within Non-associative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the construction of the standard model within the framework of
non--associative geometry. For the simplest scalar product we get the
tree--level predictions $m_W=\frac{1}{2} m_t\,,$ $m_H=\frac{3}{2} m_t$ and
$\sin^2 \theta_W= \frac{3}{8}.$ These relations differ slightly from
predictions derived in non--commutative geometry.
