Deformations of the SUSY SU(5) Theory with an Antisymmetric Tensor
</title>

<abstract>
  The N=1 supersymmetric gauge SU(5) theory with one antisymmetric tensor, n+3
fundamentals and n+4 antifundamentals has dual magnetic descriptions in the
infrared. By introducing extra singlet fields and tree level superpotential
terms to the electric SU(5) theories, we are able to make the dual theories
flow to the known SU(n)xSU(2) gauge theories which break supersymmetry
dynamically. In the n=2 case, the lifting of the pseudo-flat direction is
estimated by using dual operator mappings.
