How the Jones Polynomial Gives Rise to Physical States of Quantum
  General Relativity
</title>

<abstract>
  Solutions to both the diffeomorphism and the hamiltonian constraint of
quantum gravity have been found in the loop representation, which is based on
Ashtekar's new variables. While the diffeomorphism constraint is easily solved
by considering loop functionals which are knot invariants, there remains the
puzzle why several of the known knot invariants are also solutions to the
hamiltonian constraint. We show how the Jones polynomial gives rise to an
infinite set of solutions to all the constraints of quantum gravity thereby
illuminating the structure of the space of solutions and suggesting the
existance of a deep connection between quantum gravity and knot theory at a
dynamical level.
