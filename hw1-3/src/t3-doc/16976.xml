Coproduct and star product in field theories on Lie-algebra
  non-commutative space-times
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new approach to field theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski
non-commutative space-time, a popular example of Lie-algebra space-time. Our
proposal is essentially based on the introduction of a star product, a
technique which is proving to be very fruitful in analogous studies of
canonical non-commutative space-times, such as the ones recently found to play
a role in the description of certain string-theory backgrounds. We find to be
incorrect the expectation, previously reported in the literature, that the lack
of symmetry of the $\kappa$-Poincare' coproduct should lead to interaction
vertices that are not symmetric under exchanges of the momenta of identical
particles entering the relevant processes. We show that in $\kappa$-Minkowski
the coproduct and the star product must indeed treat momenta in a non-symmetric
way, but the overall structure of interaction vertices is symmetric under
exchange of identical particles. We also show that in $\kappa$-Minkowski field
theories it is convenient to introduce the concepts of "planar" and
"non-planar" Feynman loop-diagrams, again in close analogy with the
corresponding concepts previously introduced in the study of field theories in
canonical non-commutative space-times.
