<title>
The Even and the Odd Spectral Flows on the N=2 Superconformal Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  There are two different spectral flows on the N=2 superconformal algebras
(four in the case of the Topological algebra). The usual spectral flow, first
considered by Schwimmer and Seiberg, is an even transformation, whereas the
spectral flow previously considered by the author and Rosado is an odd
transformation. We show that the even spectral flow is generated by the odd
spectral flow, and therefore only the latter is fundamental. We also analyze
thoroughly the four ``topological'' spectral flows, writing two of them here
for the first time. Whereas the even and the odd spectral flows have
quasi-mirrored properties acting on the Antiperiodic or the Periodic algebras,
the topological even and odd spectral flows have drastically different
properties acting on the Topological algebra. The other two topological
spectral flows have mixed even and odd properties. We show that the even and
the even-odd topological spectral flows are generated by the odd and the
odd-even topological spectral flows, and therefore only the latter are
fundamental.
