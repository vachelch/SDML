<title>
Calculating the tension of domain wall junctions and vortices in
  generalized Wess-Zumino models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study BPS saturated objects with axial geometry (wall junctions, vortices)
in generalized Wess-Zumino models. It is observed that the tension of such
objects is negative in general (although ``exceptional'' models are possible).
We show how an ambiguity in the definition of central charges does not affect
physical quantities, and we comment on the stability of the junctions and
vortices. We illustrate these issues in two classes of models with Z_N
symmetry. On the basis of analytical large N calculations and numerical
calculations at finite N, we argue that the domain wall junctions in these
models are indeed BPS saturated, and we calculate the junction tensions
explicitly.
