<title>
A New Approach to the Green-Schwarz Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  By replacing two of the bosonic scalar superfields of the N=2 string with
fermionic scalar superfields (which shifts $d_{critical}$ from (2,2) to (9,1)),
a quadratic action for the ten-dimensional Green-Schwarz superstring is
obtained. Using the usual N=2 super-Virasoro ghosts, one can construct a BRST
operator, picture-changing operators, and covariant vertex operators for the
Green-Schwarz superstring. Superstring scattering amplitudes with an arbitrary
number of loops and external massless states are then calculated by evaluating
correlation functions of these vertex operators on N=2 super-Riemann surfaces,
and integrating over the N=2 super-moduli. These multiloop superstring
amplitudes have been proven to be SO(9,1) super-Poincar\'e invariant (by
constructing the super-Poincar\'e generators and writing the amplitudes in
manifest SO(9,1) notation), unitary (by showing agreement with amplitudes
obtained using the light-cone gauge Green-Schwarz formalism), and finite (by
explicitly checking for divergences in the amplitudes when the Riemann surface
degenerates). There is no multiloop ambiguity in these Green-Schwarz scattering
amplitudes since spacetime-supersymmetry is manifest (there is no sum over spin
structures), and therefore the moduli space can be compactified.
