<title>
Quantum version of the N=8 superconformal algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantized form of the soft N=8 superconformal algebra is investigated.
Its operator product expansions are shown to exhibit a one-parameter-class of
(soft) anomalies, which may be arbitrarily shifted by certain suitable quantum
corrections of the generators. In particular, the BRST operator can be
constructed and made nilpotent in the quantum version of all known realizations
of the algebra. This generalizes the results of Cederwall and Preitschopf, who
studied the $\widehat{S^7}$-algebra, that is contained as a soft Kac-Moody part
in the superconformal algebra. A Fock-space representation is given, that has
to be somewhat unusual in certain modes.
