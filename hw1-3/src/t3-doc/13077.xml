<title>
Discrete State Moduli of String Theory from c=1 Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new formulation of the space-time interpretation of the $c=1$
matrix model. Our formulation uses the well-known leg-pole factor that relates
the matrix model amplitudes to that of the 2-dimensional string theory, but
includes fluctuations around the fermi vacuum on {\sl both sides} of the
inverted harmonic oscillator potential of the double-scaled model, even when
the fluctuations are small and confined entirely within the asymptotes in the
phase plane. We argue that including fluctuations on both sides of the
potential is essential for a consistent interpretation of the leg-pole
transformed theory as a theory of space-time gravity. We reproduce the known
results for the string theory tree level scattering amplitudes for flat space
and linear dilaton background as a special case. We show that the generic case
corresponds to more general space-time backgrounds. In particular, we identify
the parameter corresponding to background metric perturbation in string theory
(black hole mass) in terms of the matrix model variables. Possible implications
of our work for a consistent nonperturbative definition of string theory as
well as for quantized gravity and black-hole physics are discussed.
