<title>
Hawking Spectrum and High Frequency Dispersion
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the spectrum of created particles in two-dimensional black hole
geometries for a linear, hermitian scalar field satisfying a Lorentz
non-invariant field equation with higher spatial derivative terms that are
suppressed by powers of a fundamental momentum scale $k_0$. The preferred frame
is the ``free-fall frame" of the black hole. This model is a variation of
Unruh's sonic black hole analogy. We find that there are two qualitatively
different types of particle production in this model: a thermal Hawking flux
generated by ``mode conversion" at the black hole horizon, and a non-thermal
spectrum generated via scattering off the background into negative free-fall
frequency modes. This second process has nothing to do with black holes and
does not occur for the ordinary wave equation because such modes do not
propagate outside the horizon with positive Killing frequency. The horizon
component of the radiation is astonishingly close to a perfect thermal
spectrum: for the smoothest metric studied, with Hawking temperature
$T_H\simeq0.0008k_0$, agreement is of order $(T_H/k_0)^3$ at frequency
$\omega=T_H$, and agreement to order $T_H/k_0$ persists out to
$\omega/T_H\simeq 45$ where the thermal number flux is $O(10^{-20}$). The flux
from scattering dominates at large $\omega$ and becomes many orders of
magnitude larger than the horizon component for metrics with a ``kink", i.e. a
region of high curvature localized on a static worldline outside the horizon.
This non-thermal flux amounts to roughly 10\% of the total luminosity for the
kinkier metrics considered. The flux exhibits oscillations as a function of
frequency which can be explained by interference between the various
contributions to the flux.
