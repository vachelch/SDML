Braneworld gravity: Influence of the moduli fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the case of a generic braneworld geometry in the presence of one
or more moduli fields (e.g., the dilaton) that vary throughout the bulk
spacetime. Working in an arbitrary conformal frame, using the generalized
junction conditions of gr-qc/0008008 and the Gauss--Codazzi equations, we
derive the effective ``induced'' on-brane gravitational equations. As usual in
braneworld scenarios, these equations do not form a closed system in that the
bulk can exchange both information and stress-energy with the braneworld. We
work with an arbitrary number of moduli fields described by an arbitrary sigma
model, with arbitrary curvature couplings, arbitrary self interactions, and
arbitrary dimension for the bulk. (The braneworld is always codimension one.)
Among the novelties we encounter are modifications of the on-brane
stress-energy conservation law, anomalous couplings between on-brane gravity
and the trace of the on-brane stress-energy tensor, and additional
possibilities for modifying the on-brane effective cosmological constant. After
obtaining the general stress-energy ``conservation'' law and the ``induced
Einstein equations'' we particularize the discussion to two particularly
attractive cases: for a (n-2)-brane in ([n-1]+1) dimensions we discuss both the
effect of (1) generic variable moduli fields in the Einstein frame, and (2) the
effect of a varying dilaton in the string frame.
