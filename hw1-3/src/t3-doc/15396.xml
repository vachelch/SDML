From D-Dbar Pairs to Branes in Motion
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate various supersymmetric brane intersections. Motivated by the
recent results on supertubes, we investigate general constraints in which
parallel brane-antibrane configurations are supersymmetric. Dual descriptions
of these configurations involve systems of branes in relative motion. In
particular, we find new supersymmetric configurations which are not related to
a static brane intersection by a boost. In these new configurations, the
intersection point moves at the speed of light. These systems provide
interesting time dependent backgrounds for open strings.
