10 = 6 + 4
</title>

<abstract>
  Some physics models have 10 dimensions that are usually decomposed into: 4
spacetime dimensions with local Lorentz Spin(1,3) symmetry plus a 6-dimensional
compact space related to internal symmetries. A possibly useful alternative
decomposition is into: 6 spacetime dimensions with local Conformal symmetry of
the Conformal Group C(1,3) = Spin(2,4) = SU(2,2) plus a 4-dimensional compact
Internal Symmetry Space that can be taken to be complex projective 2-space CP2
which, since CP2 = SU(3) / U(2), is a natural representation space for SU(3)
and is a natural local representation space for U(2) = SU(2) x U(1).
