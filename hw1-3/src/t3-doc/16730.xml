<title>
Five Dimensional SUSY Field Theories, Non-trivial Fixed Points and
  String Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study (non-renormalizable) five dimensional supersymmetric field theories.
The theories are parametrized by quark masses and a gauge coupling. We derive
the metric on the Coulomb branch exactly. We use stringy considerations to
learn about new non-trivial interacting field theories with exceptional global
symmetry $E_n$ ($E_8$, $E_7$, $E_6$, $E_5=Spin(10)$, $E_4=SU(5)$,
$E_3=SU(3)\times SU(2)$, $E_2=SU(2)\times U(1)$ and $E_1=SU(2)$). Their Coulomb
branch is ${\bf R}^+$ and their Higgs branch is isomorphic to the moduli space
of $E_n$ instantons. One of the relevant operators of these theories leads to a
flow to $SU(2)$ gauge theories with $N_f=n-1$ flavors. In terms of these
$SU(2)$ IR theories this relevant parameter is the inverse gauge coupling
constant. Other relevant operators (which become quark masses after flowing to
the $SU(2)$ theories) lead to flows between them. Upon further
compactifications to four and three dimensions we find new fixed points with
exceptional symmetries.
