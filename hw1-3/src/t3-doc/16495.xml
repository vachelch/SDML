D-Brane Probes and Mirror Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effect of mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces on D-brane probe
physics. The case of elliptically fibered K3 surfaces is considered in
detail. In many cases, mirror can transform a singular fiber of Kodaira's type
ADE into sets of singular fibers of type I_1 (II) with equal total Euler
number, but vanishing contribution to the Picard number of the mirror surface.
This provides a geometric model of quantum splitting phenomena. Mirror for
three dimensional gauge theories, interchanging Fayet-Iliopoulos and mass
terms, is also briefly discussed.
