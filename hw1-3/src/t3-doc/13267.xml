What are we quantizing in integrable field theory?
</title>

<abstract>
  We continue study of the connection of classical limit of integrable
asymptotically free field theory to the finite-gap solutions of classical
integrable equations. In the limit the momenta of particles turn into the
moduli of Riemann surfaces while their isotopic structure is related to the
period lattices. In this paper we explain that the classical limit of the local
operators can be understood as a measure induced on the phase space by
embedding into the projective space of "classical fields".
