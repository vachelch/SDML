Remarks on the Racetrack Scheme
</title>

<abstract>
  There are only a small number of ideas for stabilizing the moduli of string
theory. One of the most appealing of these is the racetrack mechanism, in which
a delicate interplay between two strongly interacting gauge groups fixes the
value of the coupling constant. In this note, we explore this scenario. We find
that quite generally, some number of discrete tunings are required in order
that the mechanism yield a small gauge coupling. Even then, there is no sense
in which a weak coupling approximation is valid. On the other hand, certain
holomorphic quantities can be computed, so such a scheme is in principle
predictive. Searching for models which realize this mechanism is thus of great
interest. We also remark on cosmology in these schemes.
