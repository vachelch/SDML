Supergravity and D-branes Wrapping Supersymmetric 3-Cycles
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct dual supergravity descriptions of D3-branes wrapping associative
3-cycles $L$. We analyse the conditions for having five-dimensional background
solutions of the form $AdS_2 \times L$ and show that they require $L$ to be of
constant negative curvature type. This provides $AdS_2$ background solutions
when $L$ is the hyperbolic space $H^3$ or its quotients by subgroups of its
isometry group. We construct a regular numerical solution interpolating between
$AdS_5$ in the UV and $AdS_2 \times H^3$ in the IR. The IR fixed point exists
at the ``intersection'' of the Coulomb and Higgs branches. We analyse the
singular supergravity solutions which correspond to moving into the Higgs and
the Coulomb branches. For negative constant curvature spaces the singularity is
of a ``good'' type in the Higgs branch and of a ``bad'' type in the Coulomb
branch. For positive constant curvature spaces such as $S^3$ the singularity is
of a ``bad'' type in both the Higgs and the Coulomb branches. We discuss the
meaning of these results.
