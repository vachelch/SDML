Kaluza-Klein Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine Kaluza-Klein branes in detail. Specifically, we show that
codimension four submanifolds that are stationary under a semi-free circle
action may be interpreted as branes or antibranes in the Kaluza-Klein reduced
space that are magnetically charged under the Kaluza-Klein field strength. We
derive the equation in cohomology that is satisfied by such a brane using an
explicit construction of the Thom class of the normal bundle of the brane
worldvolume in the reduced space. This may be applied to both the D6-brane of
Type IIA String Theory, and also to various recent constructions of magnetic
branes immersed in fluxbrane backgrounds. We then go on to study the special
case of monopole-antimonopole production in a five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein
theory, illustrating our arguments with various concrete examples.
