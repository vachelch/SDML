Quantum Black Holes as Holograms in AdS Braneworlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new approach for using the AdS/CFT correspondence to study
quantum black hole physics. The black holes on a brane in an AdS$_{D+1}$
braneworld that solve the classical bulk equations are interpreted as duals of
{\it quantum-corrected} $D$-dimensional black holes, rather than classical
ones, of a conformal field theory coupled to gravity. We check this explicitly
in D=3 and D=4. In D=3 we reinterpret the existing exact solutions on a flat
membrane as states of the dual 2+1 CFT. We show that states with a sufficiently
large mass really are 2+1 black holes where the quantum corrections dress the
classical conical singularity with a horizon and censor it from the outside. On
a negatively curved membrane, we reinterpret the classical bulk solutions as
quantum-corrected BTZ black holes. In D=4 we argue that the bulk solution for
the brane black hole should include a radiation component in order to describe
a quantum-corrected black hole in the 3+1 dual. Hawking radiation of the
conformal field is then dual to classical gravitational bremsstrahlung in the
AdS$_5$ bulk.
