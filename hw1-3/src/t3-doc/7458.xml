q-Functional Wick's theorems for particles with exotic statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  In the paper we begin a description of functional methods of quantum field
theory for systems of interacting q-particles. These particles obey exotic
statistics and are the q-generalization of the colored particles which appear
in many problems of condensed matter physics, magnetism and quantum optics.
Motivated by the general ideas of standard field theory we prove the
q-functional analogues of Hori's formulation of Wick's theorems for the
different ordered q-particle creation and annihilation operators. The
formulae have the same formal expressions as fermionic and bosonic ones but
differ by a nature of fields. This allows us to derive the perturbation series
for the theory and develop analogues of standard quantum field theory
constructions in q-functional form.
