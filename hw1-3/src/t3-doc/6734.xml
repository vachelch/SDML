``Good Propagation'' Constraints on Dual Invariant Actions in
  Electrodynamics and on Massless Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We present some consequences of non-anomalous propagation requirements on
various massless fields. Among the models of nonlinear electrodynamics we show
that only Maxwell and Born-Infeld also obey duality invariance. Separately we
show that, for actions depending only on the $F_\mn^2$ invariant, the permitted
models have $L \sim \sqrt{1 + F^2}$. We also characterize acceptable
vector-scalar systems. Finally we find that wide classes of gravity models
share with Einstein the null nature of their characteristic surfaces.
