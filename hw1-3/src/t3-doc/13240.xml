<title>
The Wess-Zumino Model and the AdS_4/CFT_3 Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the non-interacting massive Wess-Zumino model in four-dimensional
anti-de Sitter space and show that the conformal dimensions of the
corresponding boundary fields satisfy the relations expected from
superconformal invariance. In some cases the irregular mode must be used for
one of the scalar fields.
