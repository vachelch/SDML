Mass formulae and natural hierarchy in string effective supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
  We study some conditions for the hierarchy $m_{3/2} << M_P$ to occur
naturally in a generic effective supergravity theory. Absence of fine-tuning
and perturbative calculability require that the effective potential has a
sliding gravitino mass and vanishing cosmological constant, up to ${\cal
O}(m_{3/2}^4)$ corrections. In particular, cancellation of quadratically
divergent contributions to the one-loop effective potential should take place,
including the `hidden sector' of the theory. We show that these conditions can
be met in the effective supergravities derived from four-dimensional
superstrings, with supersymmetry broken either at the string tree level via
compactification, or by non-perturbative effects such as gaugino condensation.
A crucial role is played by some approximate scaling symmetries, which are
remnants of discrete target-space dualities in the large moduli limit. We
derive explicit formulae for the soft breaking terms arising from this class of
`large hierarchy compatible' (LHC) supergravities.
