Gauge fixing and abelianization in simple BRST quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  In a previous paper \cite{Simple} it was shown that the BRST charge $Q$ for
any gauge model with a Lie algebra symmetry may be decomposed as
$Q=\del+\del^{\dag},\;\;\;\del^2=\del^{\dag 2}=0,\;\;\;[\del, \del^{\dag}]_+=0$
provided dynamical Lagrange multipliers are used but without introducing other
matter variables in $\del$ than the gauge generators in $Q$. In this paper
further decompositions are derived but now by means of gauge fixing operators.
As in \cite{Simple} it is shown that $\del=c^{\dag a}\phi_a$ where $c^a$ are
new ghosts and $\phi_a$ are nonhermitian variables satisfying the gauge
algebra. However, in distinction to \cite{Simple} also solutions of the form
$\del=c^{\dag a}A_a$ where $A_a$ satisfy an abelian algebra is derived
(abelianization). By means of a bigrading the BRST condition reduces to
$\del|ph\hb=\del^{\dag}|ph\hb=0$ on inner product spaces whose general
solutions are expressed in terms of the solutions to a proper Dirac
quantization. Thus, the procedure provides for inner products for the solutions
of a Dirac quantization.
