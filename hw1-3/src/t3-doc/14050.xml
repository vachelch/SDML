<title>
Tracker fields from nonminimally coupled theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the concept of quintessence to a flat nonminimally coupled scalar -
tensor theories of gravity. By means of Noether's symmetries for the
cosmological pointlike Lagrangian L, it is possible to exhibit exact solutions
for a class of models depending on a free parameter s. This parameter comes out
in the relationship existing between the coupling F(\phi) and the potential
V(\phi) because of such a symmetry for L. When inverse power law potentials are
taken in account, a whole family of exact solutions parametrized by such an s
is proposed as a class of tracker fields, and some considerations are made
about them.
