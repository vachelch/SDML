On the Matter of the Dijkgraaf--Vafa Conjecture
</title>

<abstract>
  With the aim of extending the gauge theory -- matrix model connection to more
general matter representations, we prove that for various two-index tensors of
the classical gauge groups, the perturbative contributions to the glueball
superpotential reduce to matrix integrals. Contributing diagrams consist of
certain combinations of spheres, disks, and projective planes, which we
evaluate to four and five loop order. In the case of $Sp(N)$ with antisymmetric
matter, independent results are obtained by computing the nonperturbative
superpotential for $N=4,6$ and 8. Comparison with the Dijkgraaf-Vafa approach
reveals agreement up to $N/2$ loops in matrix model perturbation theory, with
disagreement setting in at $h=N/2+1$ loops, $h$ being the dual Coxeter number.
At this order, the glueball superfield $S$ begins to obey nontrivial relations
due to its underlying structure as a product of fermionic superfields. We
therefore find a relatively simple example of an ${\cal N}=1$ gauge theory
admitting a large $N$ expansion, whose dynamically generated superpotential
differs from the one obtained in the matrix model approach.
