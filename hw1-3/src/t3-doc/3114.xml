D=11 SUGRA as the Low Energy Effective Action of Matrix Theory: Three
  Form Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  We employ the LSZ reduction formula for Matrix Theory introduced in our
earlier work to compute the t-pole S-matrix for three form-three form
scattering. The result agrees completely with tree level D=11 SUGRA. Taken
together with previous results on graviton-graviton scattering this shows that
Matrix Theory indeed reproduces the bosonic sector of the D=11 SUGRA action
including the Chern-Simons term. Furthermore we provide a detailed account of
our framework along with the technology to compute any Matrix Theory one-loop
t-pole scattering amplitude at vanishing p^- exchange.
