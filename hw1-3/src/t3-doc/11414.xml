<title>
Shortening of primary operators in N-extended SCFT_4 and
  harmonic-superspace analyticity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the analysis of all possible shortenings which occur for composite
gauge invariant conformal primary superfields in SU(2,2/N) invariant gauge
theories. These primaries have top-spin range N/2 \leq J_{max} < N with J_{max}
= J_1 + J_2, (J_1,J_2) being the SL(2,C) quantum numbers of the highest spin
component of the superfield. In Harmonic superspace, analytic and chiral
superfields give J_{max}= N/2 series while intermediate shortenings correspond
to fusion of chiral with analytic in N=2, or analytic with different analytic
structures in N=3,4. In the AdS/CFT language shortenings of UIR's correspond to
all possible BPS conditions on bulk states. An application of this analysis to
multitrace operators, corresponding to multiparticle supergravity states, is
spelled out.
