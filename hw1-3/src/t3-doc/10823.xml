Black Holes on the Brane with Induced Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  An analysis of a spherically symmetric braneworld configuration is performed
when the intrinsic curvature scalar is included in the bulk action. In the case
when the electric part of the Weyl tensor is zero, all the exterior solutions
are found; one of them is of the Schwarzschild-(A)dS(4) form, which is matched
to a modified Oppenheimer-Volkoff interior solution. In the case when the
electric part of the Weyl tensor is non zero, the exterior
Schwarzschild-(A)dS(4) black hole solution is modified receiving corrections
from the non-local bulk effects. A non-universal gravitational constant arises,
depending on the density of the considered object and the Newton's law is
modified for small and large distances; however, the conventional limits are
easily obtained.
