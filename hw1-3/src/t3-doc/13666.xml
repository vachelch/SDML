Note on the Massive Rarita-Schwinger Field in the AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a massive Rarita-Schwinger field on the Anti-de Sitter space and
solve the corresponding equations of motion. We show that appropriate boundary
terms calculated on-shell give two-point correlation functions for spin-3/2
fields of the conformal field theory on the boundary. The relation between
Rarita-Schwinger field masses and conformal dimensions of corresponding
operators is established.
