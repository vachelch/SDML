<title>
Cosmic Strings and Quintessence
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new Lorentz gauge invariant U(1) topological field theory in
Riemann-Cartan spacetime manifold $U_{4}$. By virtue of the decomposition
theory of U(1) gauge potential and the $ \phi $--mapping topological current
theory, it is proved that the U(1) complex scalar field $\phi (x)$ can be
looked upon as the order parameter field in our Universe, and the set of zero
points of $\phi (x)$ create the cosmic strings as the spacetime defects in the
early Universe. In the standard cosmology this complex scalar order parameter
field possesses negative pressure, provides an accelerating expansion of
Universe and be able to explain the inflation in the early Universe. Therefore
this complex scalar field is not only the order parameter field created the
cosmic strings, but also reasonably behaves as the quintessence, the dark
energy.
