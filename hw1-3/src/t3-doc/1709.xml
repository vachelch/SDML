<title>
Hamiltonian formulation of Noncommutative D3--Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  Lagrangians of the Abelian Gauge Theory and its dual are related in terms of
a shifted action. We show that in d=4 constrained Hamiltonian formulation of
the shifted action yields Hamiltonian description of the dual theory, without
referring to its Lagrangian. We apply this method, at the first order in the
noncommutativity parameter theta, to the noncommutative U(1) gauge theory
possessing spatial noncommutativity. Its dual theory is effectively a
space--time noncommutative U(1) gauge theory. However, we obtain a Hamiltonian
formulation where time is commuting. Space-time noncommutative D3--brane
worldvolume Hamiltonian is derived as the dual of space noncommutative U(1)
gauge theory. We show that a BPS like bound can be obtained and it is saturated
for configurations which are the same with the ordinary D3-brane BIon and dyon
solutions.
