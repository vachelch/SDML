Systematic Renormalization in Hamiltonian Light-Front Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a systematic method for computing a renormalized light-front field
theory Hamiltonian that can lead to bound states that rapidly converge in an
expansion in free-particle Fock-space sectors. To accomplish this without
dropping any Fock sectors from the theory, and to regulate the Hamiltonian, we
suppress the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian between free-particle
Fock-space states that differ in free mass by more than a cutoff. The cutoff
violates a number of physical principles of the theory, and thus the
Hamiltonian is not just the canonical Hamiltonian with masses and couplings
redefined by renormalization. Instead, the Hamiltonian must be allowed to
contain all operators that are consistent with the unviolated physical
principles of the theory. We show that if we require the Hamiltonian to produce
cutoff-independent physical quantities and we require it to respect the
unviolated physical principles of the theory, then its matrix elements are
uniquely determined in terms of the fundamental parameters of the theory. This
method is designed to be applied to QCD, but for simplicity, we illustrate our
method by computing and analyzing second- and third-order matrix elements of
the Hamiltonian in massless phi-cubed theory in six dimensions.
