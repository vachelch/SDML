Testing Effective String Models of Black Holes with Fixed Scalars
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve the problem of mixing between the fixed scalar and metric
fluctuations. First, we derive the decoupled fixed scalar equation for the
four-dimensional black hole with two different charges. We proceed to the
five-dimensional black hole with different electric (1-brane) and magnetic
(5-brane) charges, and derive two decoupled equations satisfied by appropriate
mixtures of the original fixed scalar fields. The resulting greybody factors
are proportional to those that follow from coupling to dimension (2,2)
operators on the effective string. In general, however, the string action also
contains couplings to chiral operators of dimension (1,3) and (3,1), which
cause disagreements with the semiclassical absorption cross-sections.
Implications of this for the effective string models are discussed.
