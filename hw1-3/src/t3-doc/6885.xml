<title>
Difficulties of an Infrared Extension of Differential Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the possibility of generalizing differential renormalization
of D.Z.Freedman, K.Johnson and J.I.Latorre in an invariant fashion to theories
with infrared divergencies via an infrared $\tilde{R}$ operation.
Two-dimensional $\sigma$ models and the four-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory
diagrams with exceptional momenta are used as examples, while dimensional
renormalization serves as a test scheme for comparison. We write the basic
differential identities of the method simultaneously in co-ordinate and
momentum space, introducing two scales which remove ultraviolet and infrared
singularities. The consistent set of Fourier-transformation formulae is
derived. However, the values for tadpole-type Feynman integrals in higher
orders of perturbation theory prove to be ambiguous, depending on the order of
evaluation of the subgraphs. In two dimensions, even earlier than this
ambiguity manifests itself, renormalization-group calculations based on
infrared extension of differential renormalization lead to incorrect results.
We conclude that the extended differential renormalization procedure does not
perform the infrared $\tilde{R}$ operation in a self-consistent way, as the
original recipe does the ultraviolet $R$ operation.
