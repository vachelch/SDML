Gauge Fields and D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that self-dual gauge fields in type I superstring theory are
equivalent to configurations of Dirichlet 5-branes, by showing that the
world-sheet theory of a Dirichlet 1-brane moving in a background of 5-branes
includes an ``ADHM sigma model.'' This provides an explicit construction of the
equivalent self-dual gauge field. We also discuss type II.
