Free Superfield Realization of N=2 Quantum Super W_{3} Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We rewrite $ N=2$ quantum super $W_{3}$ algebra, a nonlinear extended $N=2$
super Virasoro algebra, containing one additional primary superfield of
dimension $2$ which has no $U(1)$ charge, besides the super stress energy
tensor of dimension $1$ in $N=2$ superspace. The free superfield realization of
this algebra is obtained by two $N=2$ chiral fermionic superfields of dimension
$1/2$ satisfying $N=2$ complex $ U(1)$ Kac-Moody algebras.
