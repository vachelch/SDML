<title>
Two-parametric zeta function regularization in superstring theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper some quite simple examples of applications of the zeta-function
regularization to superstring theories are presented. It is shown that the
Virasoro anomaly in the BRST formulation of (super)strings can be directly
computed from the original expressions of the operators as well as normal
ordering constants and masses of ground levels. Hawking's zeta regularization
is recognized as an efficient tool for direct calculations, bringing no
ambiguities.
   Possible implications for global GSO operators' phases definitions (maybe
ensuring modular invariance) will be discussed elsewhere.
