<title>
Special geometry of Calabi-Yau compactifications near a rigid limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss, in the framework of special Kahler geometry, some aspects of the
"rigid limit" of type IIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold.
We outline the general idea and demonstrate by direct analysis of a specific
example how this limit is obtained. The decoupling of gravity and the reduction
of special Kahler geometry from local to rigid is demonstrated explicitly,
without first going to a noncompact approximation of the Calabi-Yau. In doing
so, we obtain the Seiberg-Witten Riemann surfaces corresponding to different
rigid limits as degenerating branches of a higher genus Riemann surface,
defined for all values of the moduli. Apart from giving a nice geometrical
picture, this allows one to calculate easily some gravitational corrections to
e.g. the Seiberg-Witten central charge formula. We make some connections to the
2/5-brane picture, also away from the rigid limit, though only at the formal
level.
