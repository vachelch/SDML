An Exact QED_{3+1} Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the exact QED_{3+1} effective action for fermions in the presence
of a family of static but spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field profiles. An
asymptotic expansion of this exact effective action yields an all-orders
derivative expansion, the first terms of which agree with independent
derivative expansion computations. These results generalize analogous earlier
results by Cangemi et al in QED_{2+1}.
