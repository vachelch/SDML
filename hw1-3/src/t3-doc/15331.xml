M/String Theory, S-branes and Accelerating Universe
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently it was observed that the hyperbolic compactification of M/string
theory related to S-branes may lead to a transient period of acceleration of
the universe. We study time evolution of the corresponding effective 4d
cosmological model supplemented by cold dark matter and show that it is
marginally possible to describe observational data for the late-time cosmic
acceleration in this model. However, investigation of the compactification 11d
-> 4d suggests that the Compton wavelengths of the KK modes in this model are
of the same order as the size of the observable part of the universe. Assuming
that this problem, as well as several other problems of this scenario, can be
resolved, we propose a possible solution of the cosmological coincidence
problem due to relation between the dark energy density and the effective
dimensionality of the universe.
