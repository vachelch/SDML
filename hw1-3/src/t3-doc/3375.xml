<title>
Realisations of $W_3$ Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a systematic investigation of free-scalar realisations of the
Za\-mo\-lod\-chi\-kov $W_3$ algebra in which the operator product of two
spin-three generators contains a non-zero operator of spin four which has
vanishing norm. This generalises earlier work where such an operator was
required to be absent. By allowing this spin-four null operator we obtain
several realisations of the $W_3$ algebra both in terms of two scalars as well
as in terms of an arbitrary number $n$ of free scalars. Our analysis is
complete for the case of two-scalar realisations.
