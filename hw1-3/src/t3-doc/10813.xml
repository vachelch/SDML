<title>
On an easy transition from operator dynamics to generating functionals
  by Clifford algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Clifford geometric algebras of multivectors are treated in detail. These
algebras are build over a graded space and exhibit a grading or multivector
structure. The careful study of the endomorphisms of this space makes it clear,
that opposite Clifford algebras have to be used also. Based on this
mathematics, we give a fully Clifford algebraic account on generating
functionals, which is thereby geometric. The field operators are shown to be
Clifford and opposite Clifford maps. This picture relying on geometry does not
need positivity in principle. Furthermore, we propose a transition from
operator dynamics to corresponding generating functionals, which is based on
the algebraic techniques. As a calculational benefit, this transition is
considerable short compared to standard ones. The transition is not injective
(unique) and depends additionally on the choice of an ordering. We obtain a
direct and constructive connection between orderings and the explicit form of
the functional Hamiltonian. These orderings depend on the propagator of the
theory and thus on the ground state. This is invisible in path integral
formulations. The method is demonstrated within two examples, a non-linear
spinor field theory and spinor QED. Antisymmetrized and normal-ordered
functional equations are derived in both cases.
