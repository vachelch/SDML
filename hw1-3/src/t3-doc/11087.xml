Calabi-Yau Fourfolds with Flux and Supersymmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  In Calabi-Yau fourfold compactifications of M-theory with flux, we
investigate the possibility of partial supersymmetry breaking in the
three-dimensional effective theory. To this end, we place the effective theory
in the framework of general N=2 gauged supergravities, in the special case
where only translational symmetries are gauged. This allows us to extract
supersymmetry-breaking conditions, and interpret them as conditions on the
4-form flux and Calabi-Yau geometry. For N=2 unbroken supersymmetry in three
dimensions we recover previously known results, and we find a new condition for
breaking supersymmetry from N=2 to N=1, i.e. from four to two supercharges. An
example of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a toric variety that satisfies this
condition is provided.
