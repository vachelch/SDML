Curved BPS domain wall solutions in five-dimensional gauged supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the possibility of constructing supersymmetric curved domain wall
solutions in five-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity, which are
supported by non-constant scalar fields belonging either to vector multiplets
only or to vector and hypermultiplets. We show that the BPS equations for the
warp factor and for the vector scalars are modified by the presence of a
four-dimensional cosmological constant on the domain wall, in agreement with
earlier results by DeWolfe, Freedman, Gubser and Karch. We also show that the
cosmological constant on the domain wall is anti-de Sitter like and that it
constitutes an independent quantity, not related to any of the objects
appearing in the context of very special geometry.
