<title>
Classical string propagation in gravitational fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The motion of a string in curved spacetime is discussed in detail. The basic
formalism for string motion in Minkowski spacetime and in curved spacetime is
presented. The description applies to cosmic strings as well as to fundamental
strings. Major ansatze for solving the string equations of motion are reviewed.
In particular, the ``null string ansatz'', which is relevant to strings in
strong gravitational fields, is emphasised. The formalism is applied to the
motion of strings in 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein black hole backgrounds with
electric and magnetic charge. Such background spacetimes have been of interest
lately, particularly from the point of view of fundamental string theory. It is
shown that interesting results, relating to the extra dimension as seen by the
string, are obtained even at the classical level.
