Quantum radiation from spherical mirrors
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider mirrors of the spherical shape, that can expand or contract. Due
to the excitation of the vacuum around, some spherical waves radiated from
vibrating mirrors are encountered. Using experience from well-known literature
on studies of two-dimensional conformal models, we adopt a similar framework to
investigate such quantum phenomena in four dimensions. We calculate quantum
averages of the energy-momentum tensor for s-wave approximation.
