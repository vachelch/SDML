<title>
Loop symmetry of integrable vertex models at roots of unity
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been recently discovered in the context of the six vertex or XXZ model
in the fundamental representation that new symmetries arise when the anisotropy
parameter $(q+q^{-1})/2$ is evaluated at roots of unity $q^{N}=1$. These new
symmetries have been linked to an $U(A^{(1)}_1)$ invariance of the transfer
matrix and the corresponding spin-chain Hamiltonian.In this paper these results
are generalized for odd primitive roots of unity to all vertex models
associated with trigonometric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation by invoking
representation independent methods which only take the algebraic structure of
the underlying quantum groups $U_q(\hat g)$ into account. Here $\hat g$ is an
arbitrary Kac-Moody algebra. Employing the notion of the boost operator it is
then found that the Hamiltonian and the transfer matrix of the integrable model
are invariant under the action of $U(\hat{g})$. For the simplest case $\hat
g=A_1^{(1)}$ the discussion is also extended to even primitive roots of unity.
