<title>
A Mathematica Package for Computing N=2 Superfield Operator Product
  Expansions
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a general purpose Mathematica package for computing Superfield
Operator Product Expansions in meromorphic $N=2$ superconformal field theory.
Given the SOPEs for a set of ``basic" superfields, SOPEs of arbitrarily
complicated composites can be computed automatically. Normal ordered products
are always reduced to a standard form. It is possible to check the Jacobi
identities, and to compute Poisson brackets (``classical SOPEs''). We present
two explicit examples: a construction of the ``small'' $N=4$ superconformal
algebra in terms of $N=2$ superfields, and a realisation of the $N=2$
superconformal algebra in terms of chiral and antichiral fermionic superfields.
