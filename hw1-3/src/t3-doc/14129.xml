<title>
Possible confinement mechanisms for nonrelativistic particles on a line
</title>

<abstract>
  The gauge model of nonrelativistic particles on a line interacting with
nonstandard gravitational fields [5] is supplemented by the addition of a
(non)-Abelian gauge interaction. Solving for the gauge fields we obtain
equations, in closed form, for a classical two particle system. The
corresponding Schr\"{o}dinger equation, obtained by the Moyal quantization
procedure, is solved analytically. Its solutions exhibit two different
confinement mechanisms - dependent on the sign of the coupling $\lambda$ to the
nonstandard gravitational fields. For $\lambda>0$ confinement is due to a
rising potential whereas for $\lambda<0$ it is due to to the dynamical
(geometric) bag formation. Numerical results for the corresponding energy
spectra are given. For a particular relation between two coupling constants the
model fits into the scheme of supersymmetrical quantum mechanics.
