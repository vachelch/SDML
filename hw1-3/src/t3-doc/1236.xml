D-branes, B-fields and twisted K-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we propose that D-brane charges, in the presence of a
topologically non-trivial B-field, are classified by the K-theory of an
infinite dimensional C^*-algebra. In the case of B-fields whose curvature is
pure torsion our description is shown to coincide with that of Witten.
