<title>
Negative modes and decay-rate transition
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate a relationship between the number of the negative modes around
periodic instanton solution and the type of the decay-rate transition. It is
shown that for the case of first-order decay-rate transition the lowest
positive mode at low energy periodic instanton becomes additional negative mode
at high energy regime, while in the second-order case there is only one
negative mode in the full range of energy. This kind of analysis on the
negative modes makes it possible to derive the criterion for the first-order
transition.
