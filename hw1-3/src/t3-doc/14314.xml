Superparticle and superstring in AdS_3 x S^3 Ramond-Ramond background in
  light-cone gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss superparticle and superstring dynamics in AdS_3 x S^3 supported by
R-R 3-form background using light-cone gauge approach. Starting with the
superalgebra psu(1,1|2) + psu(1,1|2) representing the basic symmetry of this
background we find the light-cone superparticle Hamiltonian. We determine the
harmonic decomposition of light-cone superfield describing fluctuations of type
IIB supergravity fields expanded near AdS_3 x S^3 background and compute the
corresponding Kaluza-Klein spectrum. We fix the fermionic and bosonic
light-cone gauges in the covariant Green-Schwarz AdS_3 x S^3 superstring action
and find the light-cone string Hamiltonian. We also obtain a realization of the
generators of psu(1,1|2) + psu(1,1|2) in terms of the superstring 2-d fields in
the light-cone gauge.
