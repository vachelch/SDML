D=0 Matrix Model as Conjugate Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The D=0 matrix model is reformulated as a 2d nonlocal quantum field theory.
The interactions occur on the one-dimensional line of hermitian matrix
eigenvalues. The field is conjugate to the density of matrix eigenvalues which
appears in the Jevicki-Sakita collective field theory. The classical solution
of the field equation is either unique or labeled by a discrete index. Such a
solution corresponds to the Dyson sea modified by an entropy term. The
modification smoothes the sea edges, and interpolates between different
eigenvalue bands for multiple-well potentials. Our classical eigenvalue density
contains nonplanar effects, and satisfies a local nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation with similarities to the Marinari-Parisi $D=1$ reformulation. The
quantum fluctuations about a classical solution are computable, and the IR and
UV divergences are manifestly removed to all orders. The quantum corrections
greatly simplify in the double scaling limit, and include both
string-perturbative and nonperturbative effects.
