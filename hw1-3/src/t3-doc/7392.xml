<title>
"Dynamical" non-minimal higher-spin interaction and gyromagnetic ratio
  g=2
</title>

<abstract>
  The field-dependent invariant representation (the "dynamical" representation)
of the Poincar\'e algebra is considered as a dynamical principle in order to
get the corresponding "dynamical" electromagnetic coupling for higher spins
($s\geq 1$). If in lower-spin ($s=0,1/2$) cases the "dynamical" coupling is
taken to coincide with the minimal electromagnetic coupling the higher-spin
coupling is inevitably non-minimal, containing a term linear in the field
strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. This term leads to $g=2$.
