Generalized Gross--Perry--Sorkin--Like Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we present a new solution for the effective theory of
Maxwell--Einstein--Dilaton, Low energy string and Kaluza--Klein theories, which
contains among other solutions the well known Kaluza--Klein monopole solution
of Gross--Perry--Sorkin as special case. We show also the magnetic and electric
dipole solutions contained in the general one.
