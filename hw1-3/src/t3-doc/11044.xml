<title>
Hidden Relation between Reflection Amplitudes and Thermodynamic Bethe
  Ansatz
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we compute the scaling functions of the effective central
charges for various quantum integrable models in a deep ultraviolet region
$R\to 0$ using two independent methods. One is based on the ``reflection
amplitudes'' of the (super-)Liouville field theory where the scaling functions
are given by the conjugate momentum to the zero-modes. The conjugate momentum
is quantized for the sinh-Gordon, the Bullough-Dodd, and the super sinh-Gordon
models where the quantization conditions depend on the size $R$ of the system
and the reflection amplitudes. The other method is to solve the standard
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations for the integrable models in a
perturbative series of $1/(const. - \ln R)$. The constant factor which is not
fixed in the lowest order computations can be identified {\it only when} we
compare the higher order corrections with the quantization conditions.
Numerical TBA analysis shows a perfect match for the scaling functions obtained
by the first method. Our results show that these two methods are complementary
to each other. While the reflection amplitudes are confirmed by the numerical
TBA analysis, the analytic structures of the TBA equations become clear only
when the reflection amplitudes are introduced.
