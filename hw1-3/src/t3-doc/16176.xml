Solution of the SL(2,R) string in curved spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  The SL(2,R) WZW model, one of the simplest models for strings propagating in
curved space time, was believed to be non-unitary in the algebraic treatment
involving affine current algebra. It is shown that this was an error that
resulted from neglecting a zero mode that must be included to describe the
correct physics of non-compact WZW models. In the presence of the zero mode the
mass-shell condition is altered and unitarity is restored. The correct
currents, including the zero mode, have logarithmic cuts on the worldsheet.
This has physical consequences for the spectrum because a combination of zero
modes must be quantized in order to impose periodic boundary conditions on mass
shell in the physical sector. To arrive at these results and to solve the model
completely, the SL(2,R) WZW model is quantized in a free field formalism that
differs from previous ones in that the fields and the currents are Hermitean,
there are cuts, and there is a new term that could be present more generally,
but is excluded in the WZW model.
