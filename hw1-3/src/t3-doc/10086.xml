<title>
Phase Transition Couplings in the Higgsed Monopole Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a one-loop approximation for the effective potential in the Higgs model
of electrodynamics for a charged scalar field, we argue for the existence of a
triple point for the renormalized (running) values of the selfinteraction
$\lambda$ and the "charge" g given by $(\lambda_{run}, g^2) = (-{10/9}
\pi^2,{4/3}\sqrt{{5/3}}{\pi^2}) \approx(-11, 17)$. Considering the
beta-function as a typical quantity we estimate that the one-loop approximation
is valid with accuracy of deviations not more than 30% in the region of the
parameters: $0.2 \stackrel{<}{\sim}{\large \alpha, \tilde{\alpha}}
\stackrel{<}{\sim}1.35.$ The phase diagram given in the present paper
corresponds to the above-mentioned region of $\alpha, \tilde \alpha$. Under the
point of view that the Higgs particle is a monopole with a magnetic charge g,
the obtained electric fine structure constant turns out to be
$\alpha_{crit}\approx{0.18_5}$ by the Dirac relation. This value is very close
to the $\alpha_{crit}^{lat}\approx{0.20}$ which in a U(1) lattice gauge theory
corresponds to the phase transition between the "Coulomb" and confinement
phases. Such a result is very encouraging for the idea of an approximate
"universality" (regularization independence) of gauge couplings at the phase
transition point. This idea was suggested by the authors in their earlier
papers.
