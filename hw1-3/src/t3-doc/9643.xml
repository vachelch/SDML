<title>
Dark Radiation and Localization of Gravity on the Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the dynamics of a spherically symmetric dark radiation vaccum in
the Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario. Under certain natural assumptions we
show that the Einstein equations on the brane form a closed system. For a de
Sitter brane we determine exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions which
depend on the brane cosmological constant, on the dark radiation tidal charge
and on its initial configuration. We define the conditions leading to singular
or globally regular solutions. We also analyse the localization of gravity near
the brane and show that a phase transition to a regime where gravity propagates
away from the brane may occur at short distances during the collapse of
positive dark energy density.
