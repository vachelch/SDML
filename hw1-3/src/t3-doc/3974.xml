Elliptic Wess-Zumino-Witten Model from Elliptic Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
This letter continues the program aimed at analysis of the scalar product of
states in the Chern-Simons theory. It treats the elliptic case with group
SU(2). The formal scalar product is expressed as a multiple finite dimensional
integral which, if convergent for every state, provides the space of states
with a Hilbert space structure. The convergence is checked for states with a
single Wilson line where the integral expressions encode the Bethe-Ansatz
solutions of the Lame equation. In relation to the Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal
field theory, the scalar product renders unitary the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connection and gives a pairing between conformal
blocks used to obtain the genus one correlation functions.
