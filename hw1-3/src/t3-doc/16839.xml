Some Aspects of Brane Inflation
</title>

<abstract>
  The inflaton potential in four-dimensional theory is rather arbitrary, and
fine-tuning is required generically. By contrast, inflation in the brane world
scenario has the interesting feature that the inflaton potential is motivated
from higher dimensional gravity, or more generally, from bulk modes or string
theory. We emphasize this feature with examples. We also consider the impact on
the spectrum of density perturbation from a velocity-dependent potential
between branes in the brane inflationary scenario. It is likely that such a
potential can have an observable effect on the ratio of tensor to scalar
perturbations.
