<title>
The Jacobi identity for Dirac-like brackets
</title>

<abstract>
  For redundant second-class constraints the Dirac brackets cannot be defined
and new brackets must be introduced. We prove here that the Jacobi identity for
the new brackets must hold on the surface of the second-class constraints. In
order to illustrate our proof we work out explicitly the cases of a fractional
spin particle in 2+1 dimensions and the original Brink-Schwarz massless
superparticle in D=10 dimensions in a Lorentz covariant constraints separation.
