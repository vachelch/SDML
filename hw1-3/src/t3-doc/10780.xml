Matrix Models and Gravitational Corrections
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide evidence of the relation between supersymmetric gauge theories and
matrix models beyond the planar limit. We compute gravitational R^2 couplings
in gauge theories perturbatively, by summing genus one matrix model diagrams.
These diagrams give the leading 1/N^2 corrections in the large N limit of the
matrix model and can be related to twist field correlators in a collective
conformal field theory. In the case of softly broken SU(N) N=2 super Yang-Mills
theories, we find that these exact solutions of the matrix models agree with
results obtained by topological field theory methods.
