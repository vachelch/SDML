<title>
String versus Einstein frame in an AdS/CFT induced quantum dilatonic
  brane-world universe
</title>

<abstract>
  AdS/CFT induced quantum dilatonic brane-world where 4d boundary is flat or de
Sitter (inflationary) or Anti-de Sitter brane is considered. The classical
brane tension is fixed but boundary QFT produces the effective brane tension
via the account of corresponding conformal anomaly induced effective action.
This results in inducing of brane-worlds in accordance with AdS/CFT set-up as
warped compactification. The explicit, independent construction of quantum
induced dilatonic brane-worlds in two frames: string and Einstein one is done.
It is demonstrated their complete equivalency for all quantum cosmological
brane-worlds under discussion, including several examples of classical
brane-world black holes. This is different from quantum corrected 4d dilatonic
gravity where de Sitter solution exists in Einstein but not in Jordan (string)
frame. The role of quantum corrections on massive graviton perturbations around
Anti-de Sitter brane is briefly discussed.
