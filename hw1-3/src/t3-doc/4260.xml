Quantum Spin Dynamics (QSD) : VII. Symplectic Structures and Continuum
  Lattice Formulations of Gauge Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Interesting non-linear functions on the phase spaces of classical field
theories can never be quantized immediately because the basic fields of the
theory become operator valued distributions. Therefore, one is usually forced
to find a classical substitute for such a function depending on a regulator
which is expressed in terms of smeared quantities and which can be quantized in
a well-defined way. Namely, the smeared functions define a new symplectic
manifold of their own which is easy to quantize. Finally one must remove the
regulator and establish that the final operator, if it exists, has the correct
classical limit.
  In this paper we investigate these steps for diffeomorphism invariant quantum
field theories of connections. We introduce a generalized projective family of
symplectic manifolds, coordinatized by the smeared fields, which is labelled by
a pair consisting of a graph and another graph dual to it. We show that there
exists a generalized projective sequence of symplectic manifolds whose limit
agrees with the symplectic manifold that one started from.
  This family of symplectic manifolds is easy to quantize and we illustrate the
programme outlined above by applying it to the Gauss constraint. The framework
developed here is the classical cornerstone on which the semi-classical
analysis developed in a new series of papers called ``Gauge Theory Coherent
States'' is based.
