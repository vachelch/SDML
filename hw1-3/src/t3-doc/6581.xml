Cosmological Multi-Black Hole Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We present simple, analytic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equation, which
describe an arbitrary number of charged black holes in a spacetime with
positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In the limit $\Lambda=0$, these
solutions reduce to the well known Majumdar-Papapetrou (MP) solutions. Like the
MP solutions, each black hole in a $\Lambda >0$ solution has charge $Q$ equal
to its mass $M$, up to a possible overall sign. Unlike the $\Lambda = 0$ limit,
however, solutions with $\Lambda >0$ are highly dynamical. The black holes move
with respect to one another, following natural trajectories in the background
deSitter spacetime. Black holes moving apart eventually go out of causal
contact. Black holes on approaching trajectories ultimately merge. To our
knowledge, these solutions give the first analytic description of coalescing
black holes. Likewise, the thermodynamics of the $\Lambda >0$ solutions is
quite interesting. Taken individually, a $|Q|=M$ black hole is in thermal
equilibrium with the background deSitter Hawking radiation. With more than one
black hole, because the solutions are not static, no global equilibrium
temperature can be defined. In appropriate limits, however, when the black
holes are either close together or far apart, approximate equilibrium states
are established.
