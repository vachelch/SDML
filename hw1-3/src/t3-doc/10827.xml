N=1, D=3 Superanyons, osp(2|2) and the Deformed Heisenberg Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce N=1 supersymmetric generalization of the mechanical system
describing a particle with fractional spin in D=1+2 dimensions and being
classically equivalent to the formulation based on the Dirac monopole two-form.
The model introduced possesses hidden invariance under N=2 Poincar\'e
supergroup with a central charge saturating the BPS bound. At the classical
level the model admits a Hamiltonian formulation with two first class
constraints on the phase space $T^*(R^{1,2})\times {\cal L}^{1|1}$, where
the K\"ahler supermanifold ${\cal L}^{1|1}\cong OSp(2|2)/U(1|1)$ is a minimal
superextension of the Lobachevsky plane. The model is quantized by combining
the geometric quantization on ${\cal L}^{1|1}$ and the Dirac quantization with
respect to the first class constraints. The constructed quantum theory
describes a supersymmetric doublet of fractional spin particles. The space of
quantum superparticle states with a fixed momentum is embedded into the Fock
space of a deformed harmonic oscillator.
