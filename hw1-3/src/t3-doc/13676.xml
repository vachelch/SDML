Correlation functions of disorder operators in massive ghost theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The two-dimensional ghost systems with negative integral central charge
received much attention in the last years for their role in a number of
applications and in connection with logarithmic conformal field theory. We
consider the free massive bosonic and fermionic ghost systems and concentrate
on the non-trivial sectors containing the disorder operators. A unified
analysis of the correlation functions of such operators can be performed for
ghosts and ordinary complex bosons and fermions. It turns out that these
correlators depend only on the statistics although the scaling dimensions of
the disorder operators change when going from the ordinary to the ghost case.
As known from the study of the ordinary case, the bosonic and fermionic
correlation functions are the inverse of each other and are exactly expressible
through the solution of a non-linear differential equation.
