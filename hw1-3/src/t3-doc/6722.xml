Localized Gravity and Higher Curvature Terms
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider localization of gravity in smooth domain wall solutions of
gravity coupled to a scalar field with a generic potential in the presence of
the Gauss-Bonnet term. We discuss conditions on the scalar potential such that
domain wall solutions are non-singular. We point out that the presence of the
Gauss-Bonnet term does not allow flat solutions with localized gravity that
violate the weak energy condition. We also point out that in the presence of
the Gauss-Bonnet term infinite tension flat domain walls violate positivity. In
fact, for flat solutions unitarity requires that on the solution the scalar
potential be bounded below.
