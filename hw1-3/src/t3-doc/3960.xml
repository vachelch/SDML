<title>
Non-abelian bosonization from factored coset models in path integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a derivation of abelian and non-abelian bosonization in a path
integral setting by expressing the generating functional for current-current
correlation functions as a product of a $G/G$-coset model, which is dynamically
trivial, and a bosonic part which contains the dynamics. A BRST symmetry can be
identified which leads to smooth bosonization in both the abelian and
non-abelian cases.
