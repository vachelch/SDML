<title>
Regularisation, the BV method, and the antibracket cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the Lagrangian Batalin--Vilkovisky method for gauge theories. This
includes gauge fixing, quantisation and regularisation. We emphasize the role
of cohomology of the antibracket operation. Our main example is $d=2$ gravity,
for which we also discuss the solutions for the cohomology in the space of
local integrals. This leads to the most general form for the action, for
anomalies and for background charges.
