Introduction to Vertex Algebras, Borcherds Algebras, and the Monster Lie
  Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The theory of vertex algebras constitutes a mathematically rigorous axiomatic
formulation of the algebraic origins of conformal field theory. In this context
Borcherds algebras arise as certain ``physical'' subspaces of vertex algebras.
The aim of this review is to give a pedagogical introduction into this
rapidly-developing area of mathemat% ics. Based on the machinery of formal
calculus we present the axiomatic definition of vertex algebras. We discuss the
connection with conformal field theory by deriving important implications of
these axioms. In particular, many explicit calculations are presented to stress
the eminent role of the Jacobi identity axiom for vertex algebras. As a class
of concrete examples the vertex algebras associated with even lattices are
constructed and it is shown in detail how affine Lie algebras and the fake
Monster Lie algebra naturally appear. This leads us to the abstract definition
of Borcherds algebras as generalized Kac-Moody algebras and their basic
properties. Finally, the results about the simplest generic Borcherds algebras
are analysed from the point of view of symmetry in quantum theory and the
construction of the Monster Lie algebra is sketched.
