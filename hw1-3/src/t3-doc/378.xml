<title>
Kahler Potentials For Orbifolds With Continuous Wilson Lines And The
  Symmetries Of The String Action.
</title>

<abstract>
By employing the symmetries of the underlying conformal field theory, the
tree-level K\"ahler potentials for untwisted moduli of the heterotic string
compactifications on orbifolds with continuous Wilson lines are derived. These
symmetries act linearly on bosonic (toroidal and $E_8\times E_8$ gauge) string
coordinates as well as on the untwisted (toroidal and continuous Wilson lines)
moduli; they correspond to the scaling of toroidal moduli, the axionic shift of
toroidal moduli and the shift of the continuous Wilson line moduli. In turn
such symmetries provide sufficient constraints to determine the form of the
low-energy effective action associated with the untwisted moduli up to a
multiplicative factor.
