Considerations on Super Poincare Algebras and their Extensions to Simple
  Superalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider simple superalgebras which are a supersymmetric extension of
$\fspin(s,t)$ in the cases where the number of odd generators does not exceed
64. All of them contain a super Poincar\'e algebra as a contraction and another
as a subalgebra. Because of the contraction property, some of these algebras
can be interpreted as de Sitter or anti de Sitter superalgebras. However, the
number of odd generators present in the contraction is not always minimal due
to the different splitting properties of the spinor representations under a
subalgebra. We consider the general case, with arbitrary dimension and
signature, and examine in detail particular examples with physical implications
in dimensions $d=10$ and $d=4$.
