TeV Scale Superstring and Extra Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Utilizing the idea of extra large dimensions, it has been suggested that the
gauge and gravity couplings unification can happen at a scale as low as 1 TeV.
In this paper, we explore this phenomenological possibility within string
theory. In particular, we discuss how the proton decay bound can be satisfied
in Type I string theory. The string picture also suggests different scenarios
of gauge and gravitational couplings unification. The various scenarios are
explicitly illustrated with a specific 4-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric chiral
Type I string model with Pati-Salam-like gauge symmetry. We point out certain
features that should be generic in other Type I strings.
