<title>
Exact Gravitational Threshold Correction in the FHSV Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the automorphic forms which govern the gravitational threshold
correction $F_1$ in models of heterotic/IIA duality with N=2 supersymmetry in
four dimensions. In particular we derive the full nonperturbative formula for
$F_1$ for the dual pair originally considered by Ferrara, Harvey, Strominger
and Vafa (FHSV). The answer involves an interesting automorphic product
constructed by Borcherds which is associated to the ``fake Monster Lie
superalgebra.'' As an application of this result we rederive a result of
Jorgenson & Todorov on determinants of $\bar \partial$ operators on $K3$
surfaces.
