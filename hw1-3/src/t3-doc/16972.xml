The basis of the Ponzano-Regge-Turaev-Viro-Ooguri model is the loop
  representation basis

<abstract>
  We show that the Hilbert space basis that defines the Ponzano-Regge-
Turaev-Viro-Ooguri combinatorial definition of 3-d Quantum Gravity is the same
as the one that defines the Loop Representation. We show how to compute lengths
in Witten's 3-d gravity and how to reconstruct the 2-d geometry from a state of
Witten's theory. We show that the non-degenerate geometries are contained in
the Witten's Hilbert space. We sketch an extension of the combinatorial
construction to the physical 4-d case, by defining a modification of Regge
calculus in which areas, rather than lengths, are taken as independent
variables. We provide an expression for the scalar product in the Loop
representation in 4-d. We discuss the general form of a nonperturbative quantum
theory of gravity, and argue that it should be given by a generalization of
Atiyah's topological quantum field theories axioms.
