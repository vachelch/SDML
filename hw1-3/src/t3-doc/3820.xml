<title>
N=2 Supersymmetric Model with Dirac-Kahler Fermions from Generalized
  Gauge Theory in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the generalized gauge theory which has been proposed
previously and show that in two dimensions the instanton gauge fixing of the
generalized topological Yang-Mills action leads to a twisted N=2 supersymmetric
action. We have found that the R-symmetry of N=2 supersymmetry can be
identified with the flavour symmetry of Dirac-Kahler fermion formulation. Thus
the procedure of twist allows topological ghost fields to be interpreted as the
Dirac-Kahler matter fermions.
