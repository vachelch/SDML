Dilatonic Wilson Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we study the dilatonic corrections to the static gauge
potential between heavy sources. These corrections come from the solutions to
the the lowest order beta equations. In the energetically favoured branch, the
potential obtained is characterised by having a linear confining term, an $L$
independent term and another 1/L piece. This is indicative of a L\"uscher-type
behaviour in the strong-coupling regime of the dual gauge theory. On the other
hand, we also explore the singularity as a point where the theory becomes free.
