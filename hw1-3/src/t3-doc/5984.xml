Contact interactions in D-brane models
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the tree-level four-point scattering amplitudes in string models
where matter fields live on D-brane intersections. Extracting the contribution
of massless modes, we are left with dimension-six four-fermion operators which
in general receive contributions from three different sources: exchange of
massive Kaluza--Klein excitations, winding modes and string oscillator states.
We compute their coefficients and extract new bounds on the string scale in the
brane-world scenario. This is contrasted with the situation where matter fields
arise from open strings with both ends confined on the same collection of
D-branes, in which case the exchange of massive string modes leads to
dimension-eight operators that have been studied in the past. When matter
fields live on brane intersections, the presence of dimension-six operators
increases the lower bound on the string scale to 2--3 TeV, independently of the
number of large extra dimensions.
