<title>
Self--Dual Supergravity and Supersymmetric Yang--Mills Coupled to
  Green--Schwarz Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the {\it canonical} set of superspace constraints for self-dual
supergravity, a ``self-dual'' tensor multiplet and a self-dual Yang-Mills
multiplet with $~N=1~$ supersymmetry in the space-time with signature
$(+,+,-,-)$. For this set of constraints, the consistency of the self-duality
conditions on these multiplets with supersymmetry is manifest. The
energy-momentum tensors of all the self-dual ``matter'' multiplets vanish, to
be consistent with the self-duality of the Riemann tensor. In particular, the
special significance of the ``self-dual'' tensor multiplet is noted. This
result fills the gap left over in our previous series of papers, with respect
to the consistent couplings among the self-dual matter multiplets. We also
couple these non-trivial backgrounds to a Green-Schwarz superstring
$~\s\-$model, under the requirement of invariance under fermionic (kappa)
symmetry. The finiteness of the self-dual supergravity is discussed, based on
its ``off-shell'' structure. A set of exact solutions for the ``self-dual''
tensor and self-dual Yang-Mills multiplets for the gauge group $~SL(2)$~ on
self-dual gravitational instanton background is given, and its consistency with
the Green-Schwarz string ~$\s\-$model is demonstrated.
