How to treat $\gamma_5$
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a method to perform renormalized perturbation calculation in gauge
theories with chiral fermions. We find it proper to focus directly on the
Ward-Takahashi identities, relegating dimensional regularization into a
supplementary and secondary role. We show with the example of the Abelian-Higgs
theory how to handle amplitudes involving fermions, particularly how to handle
the matrix $\gamma_5$. As a demonstration of our method of renormalization, we
evaluate the radiative corrections of the triangular anomaly in the
Abelian-Higgs theory with appropriate number of chiral fermions. This anomaly
amplitude is calculated without any regularization and is found to vanish.
