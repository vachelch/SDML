<title>
Discrete Strings and Deterministic Cellular Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  A discrete string theory --a theory of embeddings from ${\bf Z}\times {\bf
Z}_C\to {\bf R}^D$, where $C$ is the number of components of the string-- is
explored. The closure of the algebra of constraints (`${\bf Z}_C$-Virasoro
algebra') is exhibited. The ${\bf Z}_C$-Virasoro `algebra' is shown to be
anomaly free in arbitrary number of target space dimensions. We prove the
existence of a (manifestly unitary) light-cone gauge with anomaly free Lorentz
algebra in any dimensions. The analog of vertex operators are introduced and
the physical spectrum is analysed. There are an infinite number of higher-level
states repeating a certain mass pattern and leading to an infinite degeneracy.
The connection with the continuum string theory (in $D=26$) is investigated.
Independently, following a method recently introduced by 't Hooft based on
Hilbert-space extension of deterministic systems, a particular one-dimensional
cellular automaton submitted to a deterministic evolution is shown to reduce to
a massless scalar field theory at long distance scales. This automaton is
utilized to define a (`cellular') string theory with world-sheet variables
evolving under deterministic rules, which in the framework of
`first-quantization' corresponds to the ${\bf Z}_C$ string theory mentioned
above. We show that in this theory also the target space motion of free strings
is governed by deterministic laws. Finally, we discuss a model for (off-shell)
interacting strings where space-time determinism is fully restored.
