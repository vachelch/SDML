Giant Gravitons and a Correspondence Principle
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a correspondence between the physics of certain small charge black
holes in AdS_k x S^l and large charge black holes in AdS_l x S^k. The curvature
singularities of these solutions arise, following Myers and Tafjord, from a
condensate of giant gravitons. When the number of condensed giants N_g is much
greater than the number of background branes N, we propose that the system has
an equivalent description in terms of N giant gravitons condensed in a
background created by N_g branes. Our primary evidence is an exact
correspondence between gravitational entropy formulae of small and large charge
solutions in different dimensions.
