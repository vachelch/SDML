<title>
Diluting Cosmological Constant via Large Distance Modification of
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We review a solution of the cosmological constant problem in a brane-world
model with infinite-volume extra dimensions. The solution is based on a
nonlinear generally covariant theory of a metastable graviton that leads to a
large-distance modification of gravity.
    From the extra-dimensional standpoint the problem is solved due to the fact
that the four-dimensional vacuum energy curves mostly the extra space. The
four-dimensional curvature is small, being inversely proportional to a positive
power of the vacuum energy. The effects of infinite-volume extra dimensions are
seen by a brane-world observer as nonlocal operators.
    From the four-dimensional perspective the problem is solved because the
zero-mode graviton is extremely weakly coupled to localized four-dimensional
sources. The observable gravity is mediated not by zero mode but, instead, by a
metastable graviton with a lifetime of the order of the present-day Hubble
scale. Therefore, laws of gravity are modified in the infrared above the Hubble
scale. Large wave-length sources, such as the vacuum energy, feel only the
zero-mode interaction and, as a result, curve space very mildly. Shorter
wave-length sources interact predominantly via exchange of the metastable
graviton. Because of this, all standard properties of early cosmology,
including inflation, are intact.
