Duality-invariant Quantum Field Theories of Charges and Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a manifestly Lorentz- and SO(2)-Duality-invariant local Quantum
Field Theory of electric charges, Dirac magnetic monopoles and dyons. The
manifest invariances are achieved by means of the PST-mechanism. The dynamics
for classical point particles is described by an action functional living on a
circle, if the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition for electric and magnetic
charges holds. The inconsistent classical field theory depends on an arbitrary,
but fixed, external vector field, a generalization of the Dirac-string.
Nevertheless, the Quantum Field Theory, obtained from this classical action via
a functional integral approach, turns out to be independent of the particular
vector field chosen, and thus consistent, if the Dirac-Schwinger quantization
condition holds. We provide explicit expressions for the generating functionals
of observables, proving that they are Dirac-string independent. Since
Lorentz-invariance is manifest at each step, the quantum theory admits also a
manifestly diffeomorphism invariant coupling to external gravity. Relations
with previous formulations, and with SO(2)--non invariant theories are
clarified.
