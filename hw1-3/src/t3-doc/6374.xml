Dyons and Interactions in Nonlinear (Born-Infeld) Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics with point singularities having both
electric and magnetic charges are considered. Problem of interaction between
the associated soliton dyon solutions is investigated. For the case of
long-range interaction at first order by a small field of distant solitons we
obtain that the generalized Lorentz force is acted on a dyon under
consideration. Short-range interaction between two dyons having identical
electric and opposite magnetic charges is investigated for an initial
approximation. We consider the case when the velocities of the dyons have equal
modules and opposite directions on a common line. It is shown that the
associated field configuration has a constant full angular momentum which is
independent of the interdyonic distance and their speed. This property permits
a consideration of this bidyon configuration as an electromagnetic model of
charged particle with spin. We numerically investigate movement of the dyons in
this configuration for the case when the full electric charge equals the
electron charge and the full angular momentum equals the electron spin. It is
shown that for this case the absolute value of relation between electric and
magnetic charges of the dyons equals the fine structure constant. The
calculation gives that the bidyon may behave as nonlinear oscillator.
Associated dependence of frequency on the full energy is obtained for the
initial approximation. In the limits of the electrodynamic model we obtain that
the quick-oscillating wave packet may behave like massive gravitating particle
when it move in high background field. We discuss the possible electrodynamic
world with the oscillating bidyons as particles.
