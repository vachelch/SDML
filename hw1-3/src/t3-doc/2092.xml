{\cal N}=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory on Orbifold-$T^4/{\bf Z}_2$:
  Higher Rank Case
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the partition function of {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory on orbifold-T^4/{\bf Z}_2 for gauge group SU(N). We generalize the
method of our previous work for the SU(2) case to the SU(N) case. The resulting
partition function is represented as the sum of the product of G\"ottche
formula of singular quotient space $T^4/{\bf Z}_2 $ and of blow-up formulas
including A_{N-1} theta series with level N.
