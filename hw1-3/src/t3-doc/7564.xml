<title>
On the Hagedorn Behaviour of PP-wave Strings and N=4 SYM Theory at
  Finite R-Charge Density
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the high temperature behaviour of IIB strings in the maximally
symmetric plane wave background, and show that there is a Hagedorn temperature.
Thermodynamic quantities diverge as we approach the Hagedorn temperature from
below, suggesting that the Hagedorn temperature is a limiting temperature. We
discuss the map between strings in the pp-wave background and the dual
superconformal field theory in the thermal domain. The Hagedorn bound describes
a curve in the R-charge chemical potential versus temperature phase diagram of
the dual Yang-Mills theory, suggesting that the theory dual to the pp-wave
string exists only on one side. Yet, the dual theory itself manifestly exists
on both sides of the Hagedorn bound. One possibility is that this mismatch is
an artifact of the ideal gas approximation, and that for finite coupling the
Hagedorn temperature ceases to be limiting.
