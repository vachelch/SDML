D-Brane Recoil Mislays Information
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the scattering of a light closed-string state off a $D$ brane,
taking into account quantum recoil effects on the latter, which are described
by a pair of logarithmic operators. The light-particle and $D$-brane subsystems
may each be described by a world-sheet with an external source due to the
interaction between them. This perturbs each subsystem away from criticality,
which is compensated by dressing with a Liouville field whose zero mode we
interpret as time. The resulting evolution equations for the $D$ brane and the
closed string are of Fokker-Planck and modified quantum Liouville type,
respectively. The apparent entropy of each subsystem increases as a result of
the interaction between them, which we interpret as the loss of information
resulting from non-observation of the other entangled subsystem. We speculate
on the possible implications of these results for the propagation of closed
strings through a dilute gas of virtual $D$ branes.
