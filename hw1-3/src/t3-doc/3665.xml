<title>
Vacuum Energy and Casimir Force in a Presence of Skin-depth Dependent
  Boundary Condition
</title>

<abstract>
  The vacuum energy-momentum tensor (EMT) and the vacuum energy corresponding
to massive scalar field on $\Re_{t}\times [0,l] \times \Re^{D-2}$ space-time
with boundary condition involving a dimensional parameter ($\delta$) are found.
The dependent on the cavity size $l$ Casimir energy $\wt E_{C}$ is a uniquely
determinable function of mass $m$, size $l$ and "skin-depth" $\delta$. This
energy includes the "bulk" and the surface (potential energy) contributions.
The latter dominates when $l \sim \delta$. Taking the surface potential energy
into account is crucial for the coincidence between the derivative $-\d \wt
E_{C}/\d l$ and the $ll$-component of the vacuum EMT. Casimir energy $\wt E_C$
and the bulk contribution to it are interconnected through Legendre
transformation, in which the quantity $\delta^{-1}$ is conjugate to the vacuum
surface energy multiplied by $\delta$. The surface singularities of the vacuum
EMT do not depend on $l$ and, for even $D$, $\delta =0$ or $\infty$, possess
finite interpretation. The corresponding vacuum energy is finite and retains
known analytical dependence on the dimension $D$.
