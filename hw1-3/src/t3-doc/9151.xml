Dilaton Black Holes on Thick Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a black hole domain wall system in dilatonic gravity being the
low-energy limit of the string theory. Using the C-metric construction we
derive the metric for an infinitisemally thin domain wall intersecting dilaton
black hole. The behavior of the domain wall in the spacetime of dilaton black
hole was analyzed and it was revealed that the extereme dilaton black hole
always expelled the domain wall. We elaborated the back reaction problem and
concluded that topological kink solution smoothes out singularity of the
considered topological defect. Finally we gave some comments concerning
nucleation of dilaton black holes in the presence of the domain wall. We found
that domain walls would rather prefer to nucleate small black holes on them,
than large ones inside them.
