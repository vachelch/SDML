Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in the Non-Abelian Anyon Fluid
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the theory of non-relativistic matter with non-Abelian $U(2)$
Chern-Simons gauge interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions. We adopt the mean field
approximation in the current-algebra formulation already applied to the Abelian
anyons. We first show that this method is able to describe both ``boson-based''
and ``fermion-based'' anyons and yields consistent results over the whole range
of fractional statistics. In the non-Abelian theory, we find a superfluid (and
superconductive) phase, which is smoothly connected with the Abelian superfluid
phase originally discovered by Laughlin. The characteristic massless excitation
is the Goldstone particle of the specific mechanism of spontaneous symmetry
breaking. An additional massive mode is found by diagonalizing the non-Abelian,
non-local, Hamiltonian in the radial gauge.
