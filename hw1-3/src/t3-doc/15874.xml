String representation of the SU(N)-inspired dual Abelian-Higgs-type
  theory with the $\Theta$-term
</title>

<abstract>
  String representation of the $[U(1)]^{N-1}$ gauge-invariant dual
Abelian-Higgs-type theory, which is relevant to the SU(N)-QCD with the
$\Theta$-term and provides confinement of quarks, is derived. The N-dependence
of the Higgs vacuum expectation value is found, at which the tension of the
string joining quarks becomes N-independent, similarly to the real QCD.
Contrary to that, the inverse coupling constant of the rigidity term of this
string always behaves approximately as 1/N. A long-range Aharonov-Bohm-type
interaction of a dyon (i.e., a quark which acquired a magnetic charge due to
the $\Theta$-term) with a closed electric string becomes nontrivial at $\Theta$
not equal to $N\pi$ times an integer. On the contrary, at these critical values
of $\Theta$, the scattering of dyons over strings is absent.
