On the Possibility of Large Axion Decay Constants
</title>

<abstract>
  The decay constant of the QCD axion is required by observation to be small
compared to the Planck scale. In theories of "natural inflation," and certain
proposed anthropic solutions of the cosmological constant problem, it would be
interesting to obtain a large decay constant for axion-like fields from
microscopic physics. String theory is the only context in which one can
sensibly address this question. Here we survey a number of periodic fields in
string theory in a variety of string vacua. In some examples, the decay
constant can be parameterically larger than the Planck scale but the effective
action then contains appreciable harmonics of order $f_A/M_p$. As a result,
these fields are no better inflaton candidates than Planck scale axions.
