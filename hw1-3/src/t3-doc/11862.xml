A Construction of Killing Spinors on S^n
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive simple general expressions for the explicit Killing spinors on the
n-sphere, for arbitrary n. Using these results we also construct the Killing
spinors on various AdS x Sphere supergravity backgrounds, including AdS_5 x
S^5$, AdS_4 x S^7 and AdS_7 x S^4. In addition, we extend previous results to
obtain the Killing spinors on the hyperbolic spaces H^n.
