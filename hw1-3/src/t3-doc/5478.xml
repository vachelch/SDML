<title>
A symplectic covariant formulation of special Kahler geometry in
  superconformal calculus
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a formulation of the coupling of vector multiplets to N=2
supergravity which is symplectic covariant (and thus is not based on a
prepotential) and uses superconformal tensor calculus. We do not start from an
action, but from the combination of the generalised Bianchi identities of the
vector multiplets in superspace, a symplectic definition of special Kahler
geometry, and the supersymmetric partners of the corresponding constraints.
These involve the breaking to super-Poincare symmetry, and lead to on-shell
vector multiplets. This symplectic approach gives the framework to formulate
vector multiplet couplings using a weaker defining constraint for special
Kahler geometry, which is an extension of older definitions of special Kahler
manifolds for some cases with only one vector multiplet.
