<title>
On an Alternative Approach to Gravitation
</title>

<abstract>
  Several energy-momentum "tensors" of gravitational field are considered and
compared in the lowest approximation. Each of them together with
energy-momentum tensor of point-like particles satisfies the conservation laws
when equation of motion of particles are the same as in general relativity. It
is shown that in Newtonian approximation the considered tensors differ one from
the other in the way their energy density is distributed between energy density
of interection (nonzero only at locations of particles) and energy density of
gravitational field.
  Starting from Lorentz invariance the Lagrangians for spin-2, mass-0 field are
constracted. They differ only by divergences. From these Lagrangians by
Belinfante-Rosenfeld procedure the energy-momentum tensors are build. Only one
of them is suitable for explaining the perihelion shift. This tensor does not
coincide with Weinberg`s one (directly obtainable from Einstein equation).
  It is noted that phenomenological field-theoretical approach (utilizing only
vertices and propagators) can lead to modification of theory in the region of
strong field, where till now no observational data are available.
