(F, D5) Bound State, SL(2, Z) Invariance and The Descendant States in
  Type IIB/A String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently the space-time configurations of a set of non-threshold bound
states, called the (F, Dp) bound states, have been constructed explicitly for
every $p$ with $2 \le p \le 7$ in both type IIA (for $p$ even) and type IIB
(for $p$ odd) string theories by the present authors. By making use of the
SL(2, Z) symmetry of type IIB theory we construct a more general SL(2, Z)
invariant bound state of the type ((F, D1), (NS5, D5)) in this theory from the
(F, D5) bound state. There are actually an infinite number of $(m,n)$ strings
forming bound states with $(m',n')$ 5-branes, where strings lie along one of
the spatial directions of the 5-branes. By applying T-duality along one of the
transverse directions we also construct the bound state ((F, D2), (KK, D6)) in
type IIA string theory. Then we give a list of possible bound states which can
be obtained from these newly constructed bound states by applying T-dualities
along the longitudinal directions as well as S-dualities to those in type IIB
theory.
