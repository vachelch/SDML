<title>
Knot invariants from rational conformal field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A framework for studying knot and link invariants from any rational conformal
field theory is developed. In particular, minimal models, superconformal models
and $W_N$ models are studied. The invariants are related to the invariants
obtained from the Wess-Zumino models associated with the coset representations
of these models. Possible Chern-Simons representation of these models is also
indicated. This generalises the earlier work on knot and link invariants from
Chern-Simons theories.
