Quantized 2d Dilaton Gravity and Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
We have examined a modified dilaton gravity whose action is separable into the
kinetic and the cosmological terms for the sake of the quantization. The black
hole solutions survive even in the quantized theory, but the ADM mass of the
static solution is unbounded from below. Quantum gravitational effect on the
interacting matter field and the string susceptibility of the dilaton gravity
are also examined.
