Correlators in non-critical superstrings including the spinor emission
  vertex
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the structure of correlators involving the spinor emission vertex
in non critical $N=1$ superstring theory. The technique used in the computation
is the zero mode integration to arrive at the integral representation, and
later an analysis of the pole structure of the integrals which are thus
obtained. Our analysis has been done primarily for the 5-point functions. The
result confirms previous expectations and prepares ground for a comparison with
computations using matrix models techniques.
