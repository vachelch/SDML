Black Hole Entropy and String Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  The coupling of a string to gravity allows for Schwarzschild black holes
whose entropy to area relation is $S=(A/4)(1-4\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the string
tension. This departure from the A/4 universality results from a string
instanton generating a black hole with smaller entropy at a temperature
exceeding the Hawking value. The temperature is sensitive to the presence of
classical matter outside the black hole horizon but the entropy is not. The
horizon materializes at the quantum level. It is conjectured that such a
macroscopic non local effect may be operative in retrieving information from
incipient black holes.
