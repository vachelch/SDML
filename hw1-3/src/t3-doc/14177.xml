<title>
Rotation Symmetry Breaking Condensate in a Scalar Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by an analogy with the conformal factor problem in gravitational
theories of the $R+R^2$-type we investigate a $d$-dimensional Euclidean field
theory containing a complex scalar field with a quartic self interaction and
with a nonstandard inverse propagator of the form $-p^2+p^4$. Nonconstant
spin-wave configurations minimize the classical action and spontaneously break
the rotation symmetry to a lower-dimensional one. In classical statistical
physics this corresponds to a spontaneous formation of layers. Within the
effective average action approach we determine the renormalization group flow
of the dressed inverse propagator and of a family of generalized effective
potentials for nonzero-momentum modes. Already in the leading order of the
semiclassical expansion we find strong ``instability induced'' renormalization
effects which are due to the fact that the naive vacuum (vanishing field) is
unstable towards the condensation of modes with a nonzero momentum. We argue
that the (quantum) ground state of our scalar model indeed leads to spontaneous
breaking of rotation symmetry.
