<title>
On One-loop Quantum Corrections to the Thermodynamics of Charged Black
  Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum corrections are studied for a charged black hole in a two-dimensional
model obtained by spherisymmetric reduction of the 4D Einstein-Maxwell theory.
The classical (tree-level) thermodynamics is re-formulated in the framework of
the off-shell approach, considering systems at arbitrary temperature. This
implies a conical singularity at the horizon and modifies the gravitational
action by terms defined on the horizon. A consistent variational procedure for
the action functional is formulated. It is shown that the free energy reaches
an extremum on the regular manifold with $T=T_H$. The one-loop contribution to
the action in the Liouville-Polyakov form is re-examined. All the boundary
terms are taken into account and the dependence on the state of the quantum
field is established. The modification of the Liouville-Polyakov term for a 2D
space with a conical defect is derived. The backreaction of the Hawking
radiation on the geometry is studied and the quantum-corrected black hole
metric is calculated perturbatively. Within the off-shell approach the one-loop
thermodynamical quantities, energy and entropy, are found. They are shown to
contain a part due to hot gas surrounding he black hole and a part due to the
hole itself. It is noted that the contribution of the hot gas can be eliminated
by appropriate choice of the (generally, non-flat) reference geometry. The
deviation of the {\it `` entropy - horizon area''} relation for the
quantum-corrected black hole from the classical law is discovered and possible
physical consequences are discussed.
