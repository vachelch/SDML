Two-dimensional gravitational anomalies, Schwinger terms and dispersion
  relations
</title>

<abstract>
  We are dealing with two-dimensional gravitational anomalies, specifically
with the Einstein anomaly and the Weyl anomaly, and we show that they are fully
determined by dispersion relations independent of any renormalization procedure
(or ultraviolet regularization). The origin of the anomalies is the existence
of a superconvergence sum rule for the imaginary part of the relevant
formfactor. In the zero mass limit the imaginary part of the formfactor
approaches a $\delta$-function singularity at zero momentum squared, exhibiting
in this way the infrared feature of the gravitational anomalies. We find an
equivalence between the dispersive approach and the dimensional regularization
procedure. The Schwinger terms appearing in the equal time commutators of the
energy momentum tensors can be calculated by the same dispersive method.
Although all computations are performed in two dimensions the method is
expected to work in higher dimensions too.
