Cosmological Perturbations Through a General Relativistic Bounce
</title>

<abstract>
  The ekpyrotic and cyclic universe scenarios have revived the idea that the
density perturbations apparent in today's universe could have been generated in
a `pre-singularity' epoch before the big bang. These scenarios provide explicit
mechanisms whereby a scale invariant spectrum of adiabatic perturbations may be
generated without the need for cosmic inflation, albeit in a phase preceding
the hot big bang singularity. A key question they face is whether there exists
a unique prescription for following perturbations through the bounce, an issue
which is not yet definitively settled. This goal of this paper is more modest,
namely to study a bouncing Universe model in which neither General Relativity
nor the Weak Energy Condition is violated. We show that a perturbation which is
pure growing mode before the bounce does not match to a pure decaying mode
perturbation after the bounce. Analytical estimates of when the comoving
curvature perturbation varies around the bounce are given. It is found that in
general it is necessary to evaluate the evolution of the perturbation through
the bounce in detail rather than using matching conditions.
