A note on Riemann normal coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  The goal of this note is to provide a recursive algorithm that allows one to
calculate the expansion of the metric tensor up to the desired order in Riemann
normal coordinates. We test our expressions up to fourth order and predict
results up to sixth order. For an arbitrary number of symmetric partial
derivatives acting on the components of the metric tensor subtle treatment is
required since the degree of complication increases rapidly.
