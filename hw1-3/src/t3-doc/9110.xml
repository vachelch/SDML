DLCQ Bound States of N =(2,2) Super-Yang-Mills at Finite and Large N
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the 1+1 dimensional N = (2,2) supersymmetric matrix model which
is obtained by dimensionally reducing N = 1 super Yang-Mills from four to two
dimensions. The gauge groups we consider are U(Nc) and SU(Nc), where Nc is
finite but arbitrary. We adopt light-cone coordinates, and choose to work in
the light-cone gauge. Quantizing this theory via Discretized Light-Cone
Quantization (DLCQ) introduces an integer, K, which restricts the light-cone
momentum-fraction of constituent quanta to be integer multiples of 1/K.
Solutions to the DLCQ bound state equations are obtained for K=2,3,...,6 by
discretizing the light-cone supercharges, which results in a supersymmetric
spectrum. Our numerical results imply the existence of normalizable massless
states in the continuum limit K -> infinity, and therefore the absence of a
mass gap. The low energy spectrum is dominated by string-like (or many parton)
states. Our results are consistent with the claim that the theory is in a
screening phase.
