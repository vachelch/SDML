N=1 Supersymmetric Vacua in Heterotic M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the first lecture, we derive the five-dimensional effective action of
strongly coupled heterotic string theory for the complete (1,1) sector of the
theory by performing a reduction, on a Calabi-Yau three-fold, of M-theory on
S1/Z2. The supersymmetric ground state of the theory is a multi-charged BPS
three-brane domain wall, which we construct in general. In this first lecture,
we assume the ``standard'' embedding of the spin connection into the E8 gauge
connection on one orbifiold fixed plane. In the second lecture, we generalize
these results to ``non-standard'' embeddings. That is, we allow for general E8
X E8 gauge bundles and for the presence of five-branes. Properties of these
``non-perturbative''vacua, as well as of the resulting low-energy theories, are
discussed. In the last lecture, we review the spectral cover formalism for
constructing both U(n) and SU(n) holomorphic vector bundles on elliptically
fibered Calabi-Yau three-folds which admit a section. Restricting the structure
group to SU(n), we derive, in detail, a set of rules for the construction of
three-family particle physics theories with phenomenologically relevant gauge
groups. We illustrate these ideas by constructing several explicit three-family
non-perturbative vacua.
