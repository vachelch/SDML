Spin/disorder correlations and duality in the c=1/2 string
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the method of discrete loop equations to calculate exact correlation
functions of spin and disorder operators on the sphere and on the boundary of a
disk in the $c = 1/2$ string, both in the Ising and dual Ising matrix model
formulations. For both the Ising and dual Ising theories the results on the
sphere are in agreement with the KPZ/DDK scaling predictions based on Liouville
theory; the results on the disk agree with the scaling predictions of Martinec,
Moore, and Seiberg for boundary operators. The calculation of Ising disorder
correlations on the sphere requires the use of boundary variables introduced in
[hep-th/9510199], which have no matrix model analog. A subtlety in the
calculation on the disk arises because the expansions of the correlation
functions have leading singular terms which are nonuniversal; we show that this
issue may be resolved by using separate cosmological constants for each
boundary domain. These results give evidence that the Kramers-Wannier duality
symmetry of the $c = 1/2$ conformal field theory survives coupling to quantum
gravity, implying a duality symmetry of the $c = 1/2$ string even in the
presence of boundary operators.
