<title>
Non-supersymmetric deformations of the dual of a confining gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a computational technique for studying non-supersymmetric
deformations of domain wall solutions of interest in AdS/CFT. We focus on the
Klebanov-Strassler solution, which is dual to a confining gauge theory. From an
analysis of asymptotics we find that there are three deformations that leave
the ten-dimensional supergravity solution regular and preserve the global
bosonic symmetries of the supersymmetric solution. Also, we show that there are
no regular near-extremal deformations preserving the global symmetries, as one
might expect from the existence of a gap in the gauge theory.
