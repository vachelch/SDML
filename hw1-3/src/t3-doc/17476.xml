D-Brane Probes of Special Holonomy Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Using D2-brane probes, we study various properties of M-theory on singular,
non-compact manifolds of G_2 and Spin(7) holonomy. We derive mirror pairs of
N=1 supersymmetric three-dimensional gauge theories, and apply this technique
to realize exceptional holonomy manifolds as both Coulomb and Higgs branches of
the D2-brane world-volume theory. We derive a ``G_2 quotient construction'' of
non-compact manifolds which admit a metric of G_2 holonomy. We further discuss
the moduli space of such manifolds, including the structure of geometrical
transitions in each case. For completeness, we also include familiar examples
of manifolds with SU(3) and Sp(2) holonomy, where some of the new ideas are
clarified and tested.
