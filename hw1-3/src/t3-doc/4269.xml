Cosmological solutions of braneworlds with warped and compact dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study cosmological aspects of braneworld models with a warped dimension
and an arbitrary number of compact dimensions. With a stabilized radion, a
number of different cosmological bulk solutions are found in a general case.
Both one and two brane models are considered. The Friedmann equation is
calculated in each case. Particular attention is paid to six dimensional models
where we find that the usual Friedmann equation can typically be recovered
without fine-tuning.
