Quantized Topological 2-form Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a perturbation theory of four-dimensional topological 2-form
gravity without cosmological constant.
  A 2-form and an $SU(2)$ connection 1-form are used as fundamental variables
instead of metric.
  There is no quantum correction from two-loop and higher orders in covariant
gauge, in Landau gauge and in background covariant gauge.
  We improve naive dimensional regularization and calculate an exact quantum
correction at one-loop order.
  We observe that the renormalizability depends on gauge choice in topological
2-form gravity.
  It is unrenormalizable in the covariant gauge and in the background covariant
gauge.
  On the other hand in the Landau gauge, we obtain finite but $SU(2)$
non-covariant quantum corrections.
  There may exist anomaly for the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry.
