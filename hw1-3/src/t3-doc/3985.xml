<title>
Spontaneous breaking of the C, P, and rotational symmetries by
  topological defects in two extra dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate models of complex scalar fields in the space-time that has a
two-dimensional sphere as extra dimensions. The Dirac-Wu-Yang monopole is set
in two-sphere S^2 as a background gauge field. The nontrivial topology of the
monopole induces topological defects, i.e. vortices. When the radius of S^2 is
larger than a critical radius, the scalar field develops a vacuum expectation
value and creates vortices in S^2. Then the vortices break the rotational
symmetry of S^2. We exactly evaluate the critical radius as r_q =
\sqrt{|q|}/\mu, where q is the monopole number and \mu is the imaginary mass of
the scalar. We show that the vortices repel each other. We analyze the vacua of
the models with one scalar field in each case of q=1/2, 1, 3/2 and find that:
when q=1/2, a single vortex exists; when q=1, two vortices sit at diametrical
points on S^2; when q=3/2, three vortices sit at the vertices of the largest
triangle on S^2. The symmetry of the model G = U(1) x SU(2) x CP is broken to
H_{1/2} = U(1)', H_{1} = U(1)'' x CP, H_{3/2} = D_{3h}, respectively. Here
D_{3h} is the symmetry group of a regular triangle. We extend our analysis to
the doublet scalar fields and show that the symmetry is broken from G_{doublet}
= U(1) x SU(2) x SU(2)_f x P to H_{doublet} = SU(2)' x P. Finally we obtain the
exact vacuum of the model with the multiplet (q_1, q_2,..., q_{2j+1}) = (j,
j,..., j) and show that the symmetry is broken from G_{multiplet} = U(1) x
SU(2) x SU(2j+1)_f x CP to H_{multiplet} = SU(2)' x CP'. Our results caution
that a careful analysis of dynamics of the topological defects is required for
construction of a reliable model that possesses such a defect structure.
