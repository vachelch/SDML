$DIFF(s^1)$, Teichm\"Uller Space and Period Matrices: Canonical Mappings
  via String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  There is a completely natural and intimate relationship between the
diffeomorphism group of the circle and the Teichm\"uller spaces of Riemann
surfaces discovered by us in 1988. Such a relationship had been sought-after by
physicists from conjectures connecting the loop-space approach to string theory
with the path-integral approach. Precisely, the remarkable homogeneous space
Diff$(S^1)$/$SL(2,R)$ (which is one of the two possible quantizable coadjoint
orbits of Diff$(S^1)$), embeds as a complex analytic and K\"ahler submanifold
of the universal Teichm\"uller space. Furthermore, this very homogeneous space,
Diff$(S^1)$/$SL(2,R)$, considered by the previous work as a K\"ahler
submanifold of the universal Teichm\"uller space, allows on it a natural
holomorphic period mapping, $\Pi$, that generalises the classical map
associating to a genus $g$ Riemann surface its period matrix. Utilising the
fact that the group of quasiconformal homeomorphisms of $S^1$ acts
symplectically on the Sobolev space of order $1/2$ on the circle, we (with
Dennis Sullivan) have recently extended $\Pi$ to the entire universal
Teichm\"uller space. All this is related to non-perturbative string theory.
