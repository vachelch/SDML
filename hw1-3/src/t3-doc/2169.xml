Dilaton-driven brane inflation in type IIB string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the cosmological evolution of the three-brane in the background
of type IIB string theory. For two different backgrounds which give nontrivial
dilaton profile we have derived the Friedman-like equations. These give the
cosmological evolution which is similar to the one by matter density on the
universe brane. The effective density blows up as we move towards the
singularity showing the initial singularity problem. The analysis shows that
when there is axion field in the ambient space the recollapsing of the universe
occurs faster compared with the case without axion field.
