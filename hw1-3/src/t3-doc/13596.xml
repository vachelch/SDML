Exact first-passage exponents of 1D domain growth: relation to a
  reaction diffusion model
</title>

<abstract>
  In the zero temperature Glauber dynamics of the ferromagnetic Ising or
$q$-state Potts model, the size of domains is known to grow like $t^{1/2}$.
Recent simulations have shown that the fraction $r(q,t)$ of spins which have
never flipped up to time $t$ decays like a power law $r(q,t) \sim
t^{-\theta(q)}$ with a non-trivial dependence of the exponent $\theta(q)$ on
$q$ and on space dimension. By mapping the problem on an exactly soluble
one-species coagulation model ($A+A\rightarrow A$), we obtain the exact
expression of $\theta(q)$ in dimension one.
