<title>
Weil Algebras and Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a new interpretation for the super loop space that has been used to
formulate supersymmetry. The fermionic coordinates in the super loop space are
identified as the odd generators of the Weil algebra. Their bosonic
superpartners are the auxiliary fields. The general N=1 supermultiplet is
interpreted in terms of Weil algebras. As specific examples we consider
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, Wess-Zumino model and supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. Some comments on the formulation of
constrained systems and integrable models and non-Abelian localization are
given.
