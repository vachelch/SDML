<title>
Covariant Anomalies and Functional Determinants
</title>

<abstract>
  We analize the algebraic structure of consistent and covariant anomalies in
gauge and gravitational theories: using a complex extension of the Lie algebra
it is possible to describe them in a unified way. Then we study their
representations by means of functional determinants, showing how the algebraic
solution determines the relevant operators for the definition of the effective
action. Particular attention is devoted to the Lorentz anomaly: we obtain by
functional methods the covariant anomaly for the spin-current and for the
energy-momentum tensor in presence of a curved background. With regard to the
consistent sector we are able to give a general functional solution only for
$d=2$: using the characterization derived from the extended algebra, we find a
continuous family of operators whose determinant describes the effective action
of chiral spinors in curved space. We compute this action and we generalize the
result in presence of a $U(1)$ gauge connection. Accepted for publication in
Fortschritte der Physik.
