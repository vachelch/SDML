<title>
The slowly rotating near extremal D1-D5 system as a `hot tube'
</title>

<abstract>
  The geometry of the D1-D5 system with a small angular momentum j has a long
throat ending in a conical defect. We solve the scalar wave equation for low
energy quanta in this geometry. The quantum is found to reflect off the end of
the throat, and stay trapped in the throat for a long time. The length of the
throat for j=1/2 equals n_1n_5 R, the length of the effective string in the
CFT; we also find that at this distance the incident wave becomes nonlinear.
Filling the throat with several quanta gives a `hot tube' which has emission
properties similar to those of the near extremal black hole.
