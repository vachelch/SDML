On the strong coupling region in quantum matrix string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the behavior of matrix string theory in the strong coupling region,
where matrix strings reduce to discrete light-cone type IIA superstrings except
at the usual string-interaction points. In the large N limit, this reduction
corresponds to the double-dimensional reduction from wrapped supermembranes on
R^{10} x S^1 to type IIA superstrings on R^{10} in the light-cone gauge. Such
reductions were shown classically, while they are not obvious quantum
mechanically. Recently, Sekino and Yoneya analyzed the double-dimensional
reduction of the wrapped supermembrane quantum mechanically to one-loop order
in the strong coupling expansion. We analyze the problem in matrix string
theory by using the same expansion. At the one-loop level, the quantum
corrections cancel out as was presented by them. However, at the two-loop level
we find that the quantum corrections cancel out only for the leading terms in
the large N.
