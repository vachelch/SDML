<title>
U(N) Gauge Theory and Lattice Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We explain, in a slightly modified form, an old construction allowing to
reformulate the U(N) gauge theory defined on a D-dimensional lattice as a
theory of lattice strings (a statistical model of random surfaces). The world
surface of the lattice string is allowed to have pointlike singularities
(branch points) located not only at the sites of the lattice, but also on its
links and plaquettes. The strings become noninteracting when $N\to\infty$. In
this limit the statistical weight a world surface is given by exp[ $-$ area]
times a product of local factors associated with the branch points. In $D=4$
dimensions the gauge theory has a nondeconfining first order phase transition
dividing the weak and strong coupling phase. From the point of view of the
string theory the weak coupling phase is expected to be characterized by
spontaneous creation of ``windows'' on the world sheet of the string.
