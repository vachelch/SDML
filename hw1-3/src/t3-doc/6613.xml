<title>
Consistency of the Regularization of Gauge Theories by High Covariant
  Derivatives
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that regularization of gauge theories by higher covariant derivatives
and gauge invariant Pauli-Villars regulators is a consistent method if the
Pauli-Villars vector fields are considered in a covariant in the regulating
Pauli-Villars fields is pathological and the original Slavnov proposal in
covariant Landau gauge is not correct because of the appearance of massless
modes in the regulators which do not decouple when the ultraviolet regulator is
removed. In such a case the method does not correspond to the regularization of
a pure gauge theory but that of a gauge theory in interaction with massless
ghost fields. This explains the problems pointed out by Martin and Ruiz in
covariant Landau gauge. However, a minor modification of Slavnov method
provides a consistent regularization even for such a case. The regularization
that we introduce also solves the problem of overlapping divergences in a way
similar to geometric regularization and yields the standard values of the
$\beta$ and $\gamma$ functions of the renormalization group equations.
