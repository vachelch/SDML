Bulk versus brane running couplings
</title>

<abstract>
  A simplified higher dimensional Randall-Sundrum-like model in 6 dimensions is
considered. It has been observed previously by Goldberger and Wise that in such
a self-interacting scalar theory on the bulk with a conical singularity there
is mixing of renormalization of 4d brane couplings with that of the bulk
couplings. We study the influence of the running bulk couplings on the running
of the 4d brane couplings. We find that bulk quantum effects may completely
alter the running of brane couplings. In particular, the structure of the
Landau pole may be drastically altered and non-asymptotically free running may
turn into asymptotically safe (or free) behavior.
