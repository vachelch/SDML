Comparing Implicit, Differential, Dimensional and BPHZ Renormalisation
</title>

<abstract>
  We compare a momentum space implicit regularisation (IR) framework with other
renormalisation methods which may be applied to dimension specific theories,
namely Differential Renormalisation (DfR) and the BPHZ formalism. In
particular, we define what is meant by minimal subtraction in IR in connection
with DfR and dimensional renormalisation (DR) .We illustrate with the
calculation of the gluon self energy a procedure by which a constrained version
of IR automatically ensures gauge invariance at one loop level and handles
infrared divergences in a straightforward fashion. Moreover, using the
$\phi^4_4$ theory setting sun diagram as an example and comparing explicitly
with the BPHZ framework, we show that IR directly displays the finite part of
the amplitudes. We then construct a parametrization for the ambiguity in
separating the infinite and finite parts whose parameter serves as
renormalisation group scale for the Callan-Symanzik equation. Finally we argue
that constrained IR, constrained DfR and dimensional reduction are equivalent
within one loop order.
