Spin in the path integral: anti-commuting versus commuting variables
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the equivalence between the path integral representations of spin
dynamics for anti-commuting (Grassmann) and commuting variables and establish a
bosonization dictionary for both generators of spin and single fermion
operators. The content of this construction in terms of the representations of
the spin algebra is discussed in the path integral setting. Finally it is shown
how a `free field realization' (Dyson mapping) can be constructed in the path
integral.
