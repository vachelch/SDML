ON TOPOLOGICAL $2D$ STRING AND INTERSECTION THEORY
</title>

<abstract>
The topological description of $2D$ string theory at the self-dual radius is
studied in the algebro-geometrical formulation of the $A_{k+1}$ topological
models at $k=-3$. Genus zero correlators of tachyons and their gravitational
descendants are computed as intersection numbers on moduli space and compared
to $2D$ string results. The interpretation of negative momentum tachyons as
gravitational descendants of the cosmological constant, as well as
modifications of this, is shown to imply a disagreement between $2D$ string
correlators and the associated intersection numbers.
