<title>
Transition from SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_(B-L) Representation to SU(2)_L
  x U(1)_Y by q-Deformation and the Corresponding Classical Breaking Term of
  Chiral U(2)
</title>

<abstract>
  The minimal Standard Model exhibits a nontrivial chiral U(2) symmetry if the
vev and the hypercharge splitting (Delta) of right-handed leptons (quarks) in a
family vanish and Q=T_0 + Y independently in each helicity sector. As a
generalization, we start with SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_{(B-L)} and introduce
Delta as a continuous parameter which is a measure of explicit symmetry
breakdown. Values of Delta between zero and 1/2 take the neutral generator of
the isospin-1/2 representation to the singlet representation, i.e. `deformes'
the LR representation into the minimal Standard one. The corresponding
classical O(3)-breaking term is a magnetic field perpendicular to the x_3-axis.
A simple mapping on the fundamental Drinfeld-Jimbo q-deformed SU(2)
representation is given.
