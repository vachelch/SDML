Fusion Rules in N=1 Superconformal Minimal Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The generalization to N=1 superconformal minimal models of the relation
between the modular transformation matrix and the fusion rules in rational
conformal field theories, the Verlinde theorem, is shown to provide complete
information about the fusion rules, including their fermionic parity. The
results for the superconformal Tricritical Ising and Ashkin-Teller models agree
with the known rational conformal formulation. The Coulomb gas description of
correlation functions in the Ramond sector of N=1 minimal models is also
discussed and a previous formulation is completed.
