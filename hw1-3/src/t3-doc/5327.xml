Restoration of Chiral Symmetry: A Supergravity Perspective
</title>

<abstract>
  The supergravity dual of $N$ regular and $M$ fractional D3-branes on the
conifold has a naked singularity in the infrared. Supersymmetric resolution of
this singularity requires deforming the conifold: this is the supergravity dual
of chiral symmetry breaking. Buchel suggested that at sufficiently high
temperature there is no need to deform the conifold: the singularity may be
cloaked by a horizon. This would be the supergravity manifestation of chiral
symmetry restoration. In previous work [hep-th/0102105] the ansatz and the
system of second-order radial differential equations necessary to find such a
solution were written down. In this paper we find smooth solutions to this
system in a perturbation theory that is valid when the Hawking temperature of
the horizon is very high.
