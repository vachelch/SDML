Large N Phases, Gravitational Instantons and the Nuts and Bolts of AdS
  Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent results in the literature concerning holography indicate that the
thermodynamics of quantum gravity (at least with a negative cosmological
constant) can be modeled by the large N thermodynamics of quantum field theory.
We emphasize that this suggests a completely unitary evolution of processes in
quantum gravity, including black hole formation and decay; and even more
extreme examples involving topology change. As concrete examples which show
that this correspondence holds even when the space-time is only locally
asymptotically AdS, we compute the thermodynamical phase structure of the
AdS-Taub-NUT and AdS-Taub-Bolt spacetimes, and compare them to a 2+1
dimensional conformal field theory (at large N) compactified on a squashed
three sphere, and on the twisted plane.
