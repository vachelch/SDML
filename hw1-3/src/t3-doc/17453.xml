<title>
Quantization of Bogomol'nyi soliton dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We approximate analytically the semi-classical differential cross-section for
low-energy solitonic BPS SU(2) magnetic monopoles using the geodesic
approximation. The semi-classical scattering amplitude, f(\theta), can be
expressed as a conditionally convergent infinite series which is made
absolutely convergent by analytic continuation of the generalised zeta
function. Our results suggest that the classical solitonic cross-section
(computed numerically in hep-th:9209063) and the semi-classical cross-section
are in good agreement over a wide range of scattering angles,
\pi/3<\theta<\pi/2 and \pi/2<\theta<2\pi/3.
