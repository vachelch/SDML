Extended Conformal Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the grading of fields by conformal weight, when built into the
initial group symmetry, provides a discrete, non-central conformal extension of
any group containing dilatations. We find a faithful vector representation of
the extended conformal group and show that it has a scale-invariant scalar
product and satisfies a closed commutator algebra. The commutator algebra
contains the infinite Heisenberg and Virasoro algebras. In contrast to the
classical treatment of scale invariance, covariant derivatives and gauge
transformations automatically incorporate the correct conformal weights when
the extended symmetry is gauged.
