On electric charge non-conservation in brane world
</title>

<abstract>
  In some models with infinite extra dimensions, gauge fields are localized on
a brane by gravity. A generic property of these models is the existence of
arbitrarily light bulk modes of charged fields. This property may lead to
interesting low-energy effects such as electric charge non-conservation on the
brane (decay of electron to nothing). One may worry that light charged
Kaluza--Klein modes would lead to unacceptable phenomenology due to their
copious production in, e.g., electron-positron annihilation and/or their
contribution to QED observables like anomalous magnetic moments. We argue,
however, that both loop effects and production of light charged Kaluza--Klein
modes are suppressed due to screening effect of gapless spectrum of bulk
photons.
