Supersymmetric Conical Defects: Towards a string theoretic description
  of black hole formation
</title>

<abstract>
  Conical defects, or point particles, in AdS_3 are one of the simplest
non-trivial gravitating systems, and are particularly interesting because black
holes can form from their collision. We embed the BPS conical defects of three
dimensions into the N=4b supergravity in six dimensions, which arises from IIB
string theory compactified on K3. The required Kaluza-Klein reduction of the
six dimensional theory on a sphere is analyzed in detail, including the
relation to the Chern-Simons supergravities in three dimensions. We show that
the six dimensional spaces obtained by embedding the 3d conical defects arise
in the near-horizon limit of rotating black strings. Various properties of
these solutions are analyzed and we propose a representation of our defects in
the CFT dual to asymptotically AdS_3 x S^3 spaces. Our work is intended as a
first step towards analyzing colliding defects that form black holes.
