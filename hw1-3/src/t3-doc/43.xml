Picard-Fuchs Equations and Prepotentials in $N=2$ Supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The Picard-Fuchs equations for $N=2$ supersymmetric $SU(N_{c})$ Yang-Mills
theories with massless hypermultiplets are obtained for $N_{c}=2$ and $3$. For
$SU(2)$ we derive the non-linear differential equations for the prepotentials
and calculate full non-perturbative corrections to the effective gauge coupling
constant in the weak and strong coupling regions.
