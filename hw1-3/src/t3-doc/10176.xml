On Associativity Equations in Dispersionless Integrable Hierarchies
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the origin of the associativity (WDVV) equations in the context of
quasiclassical or Whitham hierarchies. The associativity equations are shown to
be encoded in the dispersionless limit of the Hirota equations for KP and Toda
hierarchies. We show, therefore, that any tau-function of dispersionless KP or
Toda hierarchy provides a solution to associativity equations. In general, they
depend on infinitely many variables. We also discuss the particular solution to
the dispersionless Toda hierarchy that describes conformal mappings and
construct a family of new solutions to the WDVV equations depending on finite
number of variables.
