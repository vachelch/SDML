Brane worlds with bolts
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a family of (p+3)-dimensional brane worlds in which the brane
has one compact extra dimension, the bulk has two extra dimensions, and the
bulk closes regularly at codimension two submanifolds known as bolts. The
(p+1)-dimensional low energy spacetime M_{low} may be any Einstein space with
an arbitrary cosmological constant, the value of the bulk cosmological constant
is arbitrary, and the only fields are the metric and a bulk Maxwell field. The
brane can be chosen to have positive tension, and the closure of the bulk
provides a singularity-free boundary condition for solutions that contain black
holes or gravitational waves in M_{low}. The spacetimes admit a nonlinear
gravitational wave whose properties suggest that the Newtonian gravitational
potential on a flat M_{low} will behave essentially as the static potential of
a massless minimally coupled scalar field with Neumann boundary conditions.
When M_{low} is (p+1)-dimensional Minkowski with p\ge3 and the bulk
cosmological constant vanishes, this static scalar potential is shown to have
the long distance behaviour characteristic of p spatial dimensions.
