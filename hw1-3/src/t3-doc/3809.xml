Supersymmetric Domain Walls and Strings in D=5 gauged Supergravity
  coupled to Vector Multiplets
</title>

<abstract>
  We present new supersymmetric domain wall and string solutions of
five-dimensional N = 2 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of
vector multiplets. Using the techniques of very special geometry allows to
obtain the most general domain wall preserving half of the supersymmetries.
This solution, which describes a renormalization group flow in the dual field
theory, is given in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions. The magnetically
charged, one quarter supersymmetric string solutions are shown to be closely
related to Liouville theory. We furthermore investigate general product space
compactifications, and show that topological transitions from AdS_3 x S^2 to
AdS_3 x H^2 can occur when one moves in moduli space.
