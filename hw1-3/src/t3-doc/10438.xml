The nonminimal scalar multiplet: duality, sigma-model, beta-function
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute in superspace the one-loop beta-function for the nonlinear
sigma-model defined in terms of the nonminimal scalar multiplet. The recently
proposed quantization of this complex linear superfield, viewed as the field
strength of an unconstrained gauge spinor superfield, allows to handle
efficiently the infinite tower of ghosts via the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism.
We find that the classical duality of the nonminimal scalar and chiral
multiplets is maintained at the quantum one-loop level.
