M-Theory, Topological Strings and Spinning Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider M-theory compactification on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The recently
discovered connection between the BPS states of wrapped M2 branes and the
topological string amplitudes on the threefold is used both as a tool to
compute topological string amplitudes at higher genera as well as to unravel
the degeneracies and quantum numbers of BPS states. Moduli spaces of $k$-fold
symmetric products of the wrapped M2 brane play a crucial role. We also show
that the topological string partition function is the Calabi-Yau version of the
elliptic genus of the symmetric product of $K3$'s and use the macroscopic
entropy of spinning black holes in 5 dimensions to obtain new predictions for
the asymptotic growth of the topological string amplitudes at high genera.
