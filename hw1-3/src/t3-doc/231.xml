<title>
Quest for a Self-Tuning Brane-World Solution to the Cosmological
  Constant Problem
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been proposed that the geometry of an extra dimension could
automatically adjust itself to compensate for an arbitrary energy density on
the 3-D brane which we are presumed to inhabit, such that a static solution to
Einstein's equation results. This would solve the long-standing cosmological
constant problem, of why our universe is not overwhelmed by the enormous energy
of the quantum vacuum fluctuations predicted by quantum field theory. I will
review some of the attempts along these lines, and present a no-go theorem
showing that these attempts are doomed, at least within one of the most
promising classes of models.
