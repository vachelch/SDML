<title>
Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics and Geometry from the Quantization of
  C-spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Four years ago the Extended Scale Relativity (ESR) theory in C-spaces
(Clifford manifolds) was proposed as the plausible physical foundations of
string theory. In such theory the speed of light and the minimum Planck scale
are the two universal invariants. All the dimensions of a C-space can be
treated on equal footing by implementing the holographic principle associated
with a nested family of p-loops of various dimensionalities. This is achieved
by using polyvector valued coordinates in C-spaces that encode in one stroke
points, lines, areas, volumes,.....We review the derivation of the minimal
length/time string/brane uncertainty relations and the maximum Planck
temperature thermodynamical uncertainty relation. The Weyl-Heisenberg algebra
in C-spaces is constructed which $induces$ a Noncommutative Geometric structure
in the $ X^A $ coordinates. Hence quantization in C-spaces involves in a
natural fashion a Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics and Field Theory, rather
than being postulated ad-hoc. A QFT in C-spaces may very likely involve
(Braided Hopf) Quantum Clifford algebras and generalized Moyal-like star
products associated with multisymplectic geometry.
