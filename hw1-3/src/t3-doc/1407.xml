Exterior Differentials in Superspace and Poisson Brackets
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that two definitions for an exterior differential in superspace,
giving the same exterior calculus, yet lead to different results when applied
to the Poisson bracket. A prescription for the transition with the help of
these exterior differentials from the given Poisson bracket of definite
Grassmann parity to another bracket is introduced. It is also indicated that
the resulting bracket leads to generalization of the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket
for the cases of superspace and brackets of diverse Grassmann parities. It is
shown that in the case of the Grassmann-odd exterior differential the resulting
bracket is the bracket given on exterior forms. The above-mentioned transition
with the use of the odd exterior differential applied to the linear even/odd
Poisson brackets, that correspond to semi-simple Lie groups, results,
respectively, in also linear odd/even brackets which are naturally connected
with the Lie superalgebra. The latter contains the BRST and anti-BRST charges
and can be used for calculation of the BRST operator cogomology.
