<title>
Self-Dual Charged Vortices of Finite Energy per Unit Length in $3+1$
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain both topological as well as nontopological self-dual charged vortex
solutions of finite energy per unit length in a generalized abelian Higgs model
in $3+1$ dimensions. In this model the Bogomol'nyi bound on the energy per unit
length is obtained as a linear combination of the magnetic flux and the
electric charge per unit length.
