New Realisations of W Algebras and W Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss new realisations of $W$ algebras in which the currents are
expressed in terms of two arbitrary commuting energy-momentum tensors together
with a set of free scalar fields. This contrasts with the previously-known
realisations, which involve only one energy-momentum tensor. Since realisations
of non-linear algebras are not easy to come by, the fact that this new class
exists is of intrinsic interest. We use these new realisations to build the
corresponding $W$-string theories and show that they are effectively described
by two independent ordinary Virasoro-like strings.
