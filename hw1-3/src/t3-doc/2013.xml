Conformal actions in any dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  Biconformal gauging of the conformal group has a scale-invariant volume form,
permitting a single form of the action to be invariant in any dimension. We
display several 2n-dim scale-invariant polynomial actions and a dual action. We
solve the field equations for the most general action linear in the curvatures
for a minimal torsion geometry. In any dimension n>2, the solution is foliated
by equivalent n-dim Ricci-flat Riemannian spacetimes, and the full 2n-dim space
is symplectic. Two fields defined entirely on the Riemannian submanifolds
completely determine the solution: a metric, and a symmetric tensor.
