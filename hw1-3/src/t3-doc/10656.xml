<title>
On Stringy Thresholds in SYM/AdS Thermodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider aspects of the role of stringy scales and Hagedorn temperatures
in the correspondence between various field theories and AdS-type spaces. The
boundary theory is set on a toroidal world-volume to enable small scales to
appear in the supergravity backgrounds also for low field-theory temperatures.
We find that thermodynamical considerations tend to favour background manifolds
with no string-size characteristic scales. The gravitational dynamics censors
the reliable exposure of Hagedorn physics on the supergravity side, and the
system does not allow the study of the Hagedorn scale by low-temperature field
theories. These results are obtained following some heuristic assumptions on
the character of stringy modifications to the gravitational backgrounds. A rich
phenomenology appears on the supergravity side, with different string
backgrounds dominating in different regions, which should have field-theoretic
consequences. Six-dimensional world volumes turn out to be borderline cases
from several points of view. For lower dimensional world-volumes, a fully
holographic behaviour is exhibited to order 1/N^2, and open strings in their
presence are found to have a thermodynamical Hagedorn behaviour similar to that
of closed strings in flat space.
