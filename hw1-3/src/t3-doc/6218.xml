Topological Transitions and Enhancon-like Geometries in Calabi-Yau
  Compactifications of M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the impact of topological phase transitions of the internal
Calabi-Yau threefold on the space-time geometry of five-dimensional extremal
black holes and black strings. For flop transitions and SU(2) gauge symmetry
enhancement we show that solutions can always be continued and that the
behaviour of metric, gauge fields and scalars can be characterized in a model
independent way. Then we look at supersymmetric solutions which describe naked
singularities rather than geometries with a horizon. For black strings we show
that the solution cannot become singular as long as the scalar fields take
values inside the Kahler cone. For black holes we establish the same result for
the elliptic fibrations over the Hirzebruch surfaces F_0, F_1, F_2. These three
models exhibit a behaviour similar to the enhancon, since one runs into SU(2)
enhancement before reaching the apparent singularity. Using the proper
continuation inside the enhancon radius one finds that the solution is regular.
