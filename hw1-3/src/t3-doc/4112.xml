Geometric Entropy, Wave Functionals, and Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop techniques for calculating the ground state wave functional and
the geometric entropy for some simple field theories. Special attention is
devoted to fermions, which present special technical difficulties in this
regard. Explicit calculations are carried through for free mass bosons and
fermions in two dimensions, using an adaptation of Unruh's technique to treat
black hole radiance.
