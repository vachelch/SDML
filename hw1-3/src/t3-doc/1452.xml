<title>
Dynamical Lorentz Symmetry Breaking from 3 + 1 Renormalizable Model with
  Wess-Zumino Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the renormalizable abelian vector-field models in the presence of
the Wess-Zumino interaction with the pseudoscalar matter. The renormalizability
is achieved by supplementing the standard kinetic term of vector fields with
higher derivatives. The appearance of fourth power of momentum in the
vector-field propagator leads to the super-renormalizable theory in which the
beta-function, the vector-field renormalization constant and the anomalous mass
dimension are calculated exactly. It is shown that this model has the infrared
stable fixed point and its low-energy limit is non-trivial. The modified
effective potential for the pseudoscalar matter leads to the occurrence of the
quantum dynamical breaking of Lorentz symmetry.
