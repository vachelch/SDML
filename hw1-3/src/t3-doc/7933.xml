Pedagogical Introduction to Hamiltonian BRST formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  Hamiltonian BRST formalism (FV formalism) includes many auxiliary fields
without explanation. Its path-integration has a simple form by using BRST
charge, but its construction is quite mechanically and hard to understand
physical meaning. In this paper we perform the phase space path-integral with
requiring BRST invariance for action and measure, and show that the resultant
form is equivalent to the Hamiltonian BRST (FV) formalism in gravitational
theory. This explains why so many auxiliary fields are necessary to be
introduced. We also find the gauge fixing is automatically done by requiring
the BRST invariance of the path-integral measure. This is a pedagogical
introduction to Hamiltonian BRST formalism.
