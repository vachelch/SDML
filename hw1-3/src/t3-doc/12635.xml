Anisotropic Born-Infeld Cosmologies
</title>

<abstract>
  Anisotropic cosmological spacetimes are constructed from spherically
symmetric solutions to Einstein's equations coupled to nonlinear
electrodynamics and a positive cosmological constant. This is accomplished by
finding solutions in which the roles of $r$ and $t$ are interchanged for all
$r>0$ (i.e. $r$ becomes timelike and $t$ becomes spacelike). Constant time
hypersurfaces have topology $R\times S^2$ and in all the spacetimes considered
the radius of the two sphere vanishes as $t$ goes to zero. The scale factor of
the other dimension diverges as $t$ goes to zero in some solutions and vanishes
(or goes to a constant) in other solutions. At late times local observers would
see the universe to be homogeneous and isotropic.
