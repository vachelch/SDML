<title>
Wick Type Symbol and Deformed Algebra of Exterior Forms
</title>

<abstract>
  The covariant descripion is constructed for the Wick-type symbols on
symplectic manifolds by means of the Fedosov procedure. The geometry of the
manifolds admitting this symbol is explored. The superextended version of the
Wick-type star-product is introduced and a possible application of the
construction to the noncommutative field theory is discussed.
