From AdS/CFT correspondence to hydrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the correlation functions of R-charge currents and components of
the stress-energy tensor in the strongly coupled large-N finite-temperature N=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, following a recently formulated Minkowskian
AdS/CFT prescription. We observe that in the long-distance, low-frequency
limit, such correlators have the form dictated by hydrodynamics. We deduce from
the calculations the R-charge diffusion constant and the shear viscosity. The
value for the latter is in agreement with an earlier calculation based on the
Kubo formula and absorption by black branes.
