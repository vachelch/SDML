<title>
Noncommutative deformation of four dimensional Einstein gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a model for noncommutative gravity in four dimensions, which
reduces to the Einstein-Hilbert action in the commutative limit. Our proposal
is based on a gauge formulation of gravity with constraints. While the action
is metric independent, the constraints insure that it is not topological. We
find that the choice of the gauge group and of the constraints are crucial to
recover a correct deformation of standard gravity. Using the Seiberg-Witten map
the whole theory is described in terms of the vierbeins and of the Lorentz
transformations of its commutative counterpart. We solve explicitly the
constraints and exhibit the first order noncommutative corrections to the
Einstein-Hilbert action.
