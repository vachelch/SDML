<title>
Invariant Regularization of Supersymmetric Chiral Gauge Theory. II
</title>

<abstract>
  By undertaking additional analyses postponed in a previous paper, we complete
our construction of a manifestly supersymmetric gauge-covariant regularization
of supersymmetric chiral gauge theories. We present the following: An
evaluation of the covariant gauge anomaly; a proof of the integrability of the
covariant gauge current in anomaly-free cases; a calculation of a one-loop
superconformal anomaly in the gauge supermultiplet sector. On the last point,
we find that the ghost-anti-ghost supermultiplet and the Nakanishi-Lautrup
supermultiplet give rise to BRST exact contributions which, due to
``tree-level'' Slavnov-Taylor identities in our regularization scheme, can
safely be neglected, at least at the one-loop level.
