<title>
Quantum group and Manin plane related to a coloured braid group
  representation
</title>

<abstract>
  By considering `coloured' braid group representation we have obtained a
quantum group, which reduces to the standard $GL_q(2)$ and $GL_{p,q}(2)$ cases
at some particular limits of the `colour' parameters. In spite of quite
complicated nature, all of these new quantum group relations can be expressed
neatly in the Heisenberg-Weyl form, for a nontrivial choice of the basis
elements. Furthermore, it is possible to associate invariant Manin planes,
parametrised by the `colour' variables, with such quantum group structure.
