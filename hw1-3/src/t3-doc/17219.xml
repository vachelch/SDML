Screw Photon-Like (3+1)-Solitons in Extended Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper aims to present explicit photon-like (3+1) spatially finite
soliton solutions of screw type to the vacuum field equations of Extended
Electrodynamics (EED) in relativistic formulation. We begin with emphasizing
the need for spatially finite soliton modelling of microobjects. Then we
briefly comment the properties of solitons and photons and recall some facts
from EED. Making use of the localizing functions from differential topology
(used in the partition of unity) we explicitly construct spatially finite screw
solutions. Further a new description of the spin momentum inside EED, based on
the notion for energy-momentum exchange between $F$ and $*F$, isintroduced and
used to compute the integral spin momentum of a screw soliton. The consistency
between the spatial and time periodicity naturally leads to a particular
relation between the longitudinal and transverse sizes of the screw solution,
namely, it is equal to $\pi$. The Planck's formula $E=h\nu$ in the form of
$ET=h$ arizes as a measure of the integral spin momentum.
