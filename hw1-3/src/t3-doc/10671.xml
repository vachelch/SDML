Three Point Functions of Chiral Primary Operators in d=3, N= 8 and d=6,
  N=(2,0) SCFT at Large N
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate three point functions of
chiral primary operators at large N in d=3, N=8 and d=6, N=(2,0) superconformal
field theories. These theories are related to the infrared fixed points of
world-volume descriptions of N coincident M2 and M5 branes, respectively. The
computation can be generalized by employing a gravitational action in arbitrary
dimensions D, coupled to a (p+1)-form and appropriately compactified on
AdS(D-p-2)xS(p+2). We note a surprising coincidence: this generalized model
reproduces for D=10, p=3 the three point functions of d=4, N=4 SYM chiral
primary operators at large N.
