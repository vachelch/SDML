<title>
Chern-Simons Theory and the Quark-Gluon Plasma
</title>

<abstract>
  The generating functional for hard thermal loops in QCD is important in
setting up a resummed perturbation theory, so that all terms of a given order
in the coupling constant can be consistently taken into account. It is also the
functional which leads to a gauge invariant description of Debye screening and
plasma waves in the quark-gluon plasma. We have recently shown that this
functional is closely related to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons gauge theory.
In this paper, this relationship is explored and explained in more detail,
along with some generalizations.
