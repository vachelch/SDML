On the way to Brane New World
</title>

<abstract>
  In this report we consider brane-world universe (New Brane World) where an
arbitrary large $N$ quantum CFT exists on the domain wall. This corresponds to
implementing of Randall-Sundrum compactification within the context of AdS/CFT
correspondence. Using anomaly induced effective action for domain wall CFT, the
possibility of self-consistent quantum creation of 4d de Sitter wall universe
(inflation) is demonstrated. In case of maximally SUSY Yang-Mills theory the
exact correspondence with radius and effective tension found by
Hawking-Hertog-Reall is obtained.
  We also discuss the bosonic sector of 5d gauged supergravity with single
scalar and taking the boundary action as predicted by supersymmetry and discuss
the possibility to supersymmetrize dilatonic New Brane World. It is
demonstrated that for a number of superpotentials the flat SUSY dilatonic
brane-world (with dynamically induced brane dilaton) or quantum-induced de
Sitter dilatonic brane-world (not Anti-de Sitter one) where SUSY is broken by
the quantum effects occurs. The analysis of graviton perturbations indicates
that gravity is localized on such branes.
  New Brane World is useful in the study of FRW dynamics and cosmological
entropy bounds. Brane stress tensor is induced by quantum effects of dual CFT
and brane crosses the horizon of AdS black hole. The similarity between CFT
entropy at the horizon and FRW equations is extended on the quantum level. This
suggests the way to understand cosmological entropy bounds in quantum gravity.
