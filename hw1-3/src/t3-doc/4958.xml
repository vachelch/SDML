Macroscopic properties of A-statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  A-statistics is defined in the context of the Lie algebra sl(n+1). Some
thermal properties of A-statistics are investigated under the assumption that
the particles interact only via statistical interaction imposed by the Pauli
principle of A-statistics. Apart from the general case, three particular
examples are studied in more detail: (a) the particles have one and the same
energy and chemical potential; (b) equidistant energy spectrum; (c) two species
of particles with one and the same energy and chemical potential within each
class. The grand partition functions and the average number of particles are
among the thermodynamical quantities written down explicitly.
