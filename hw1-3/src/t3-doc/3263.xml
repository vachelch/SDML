<title>
Hawking Radiation in String Theory and the String Phase of Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum string emission by Black Holes is computed in the framework of
the `string analogue model' (or thermodynamical approach), which is well suited
to combine QFT and string theory in curved backgrounds (particulary here, as
black holes and strings posses intrinsic thermal features and temperatures).
The QFT-Hawking temperature T_H is upper bounded by the string temperature T_S
in the black hole background. The black hole emission spectrum is an incomplete
gamma function of (T_H - T_S). For T_H << T_S, it yields the QFT-Hawking
emission. For T_H \to T_S, it shows highly massive string states dominate the
emission and undergo a typical string phase transition to a microscopic
`minimal' black hole of mass M_{\min} or radius r_{\min} (inversely
proportional to T_S) and string temperature T_S. The semiclassical QFT black
hole (of mass M and temperature T_H) and the string black hole (of mass M_{min}
and temperature T_S) are mapped one into another by a `Dual' transform which
links classical/QFT and quantum string regimes. The string back reaction effect
(selfconsistent black hole solution of the semiclassical Einstein equations
with mass M_+ (radius r_+) and temperature T_+) is computed. Both, the QFT and
string black hole regimes are well defined and bounded: r_{min} leq r_+ \leq
r_S, M_{min} \leq M_+ \leq M, T_H \leq T_+ \leq T_S. The string `minimal' black
hole has a life time tau_{min} \simeq \frac{k_B c}{G \hbar} T^{-3}_S.
