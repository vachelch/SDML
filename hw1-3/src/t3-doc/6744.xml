Casimir Effect on the Worldline
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a method to compute the Casimir effect for arbitrary geometries.
The method is based on the string-inspired worldline approach to quantum field
theory and its numerical realization with Monte-Carlo techniques. Concentrating
on Casimir forces between rigid bodies induced by a fluctuating scalar field,
we test our method with the parallel-plate configuration. For the
experimentally relevant sphere-plate configuration, we study curvature effects
quantitatively and perform a comparison with the ``proximity force
approximation'', which is the standard approximation technique. Sizable
curvature effects are found for a distance-to-curvature-radius ratio of a/R >~
0.02. Our method is embedded in renormalizable quantum field theory with a
controlled treatment of the UV divergencies. As a technical by-product, we
develop various efficient algorithms for generating closed-loop ensembles with
Gaussian distribution.
