A Solitonic 3-Brane in 6D Bulk
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a solitonic 3-brane solution in the 6-dimensional
Einstein-Hilbert-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a (negative) cosmological term. This
solitonic brane world is delta-function-like. Near the brane the metric is that
for a product of the 4-dimensional flat Minkowski space with a 2-dimensional
``wedge'' with a deficit angle (which depends on the solitonic brane tension).
Far from the brane the metric approaches that for a product of the
5-dimensional AdS space and a circle. This solitonic solution exists for a
special value of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling (for which we also have a
delta-function-like codimension-1 solitonic solution), and the solitonic brane
tension can take values in a continuous range. We discuss various properties of
this solitonic brane world, including coupling between gravity and matter
localized on the brane.
