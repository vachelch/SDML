<title>
Peeling and Multi-critical Matter Coupled to Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to determine the unknown functions arising when the peeling
decomposition is applied to multi-critical matter coupled to two-dimensional
quantum gravity and compute the loop-loop correlation functions. The results
that $\eta=2+2/(2K-3)$ and $\nu=1-3/2K$ agree with the slicing decomposition,
and satisfy Fisher scaling.
