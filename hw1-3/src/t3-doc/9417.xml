Comment on anomaly matching in N=1 supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  An attempt is made at a systematic approach to anomaly matching problem in
non-Abelian electric-magnetic duality in N=1 supersymmetric QCD. A strategy we
employ is somewhat analogous to anomaly analyses in grand unified models where
the anomaly cancellation becomes more transparent if one embeds SU(5)
multiplets into a multiplet of (anomaly-free) SO(10). A complication arises in
the treatment of $U^{AF}_{R}(1)^{3}$ matching where $U^{AF}_{R}(1)$ is
anomaly-free $R$ symmetry. It is noted that a relatively systematic analysis of
the anomaly matching is possible if one considers the formal breaking sequence
of color gauge symmetry: $SU(N_{f})_{c}\to SU(N_{c})_{c}\times
SU(\tilde{N}_{c})_{c}$ with $N_{f}= N_{c}+ \tilde{N}_{c}$, where $N_{f}$ stands
for the number of massless quarks.
