<title>
Topics in 2D integrable field theories with boundary interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study different aspects of integrable boundary quantum field theories,
focusing mostly on the ``boundary sine-Gordon model'' and its applications to
condensed matter physics. The first part of the review deals with formal
problems. We analyze the classical limit and perform semi-classical
quantization. We show that the non-relativistic limit corresponds to the
Calogero-Moser model with a boundary potential. We construct a lattice
regularization of the problem via the XXZ chain. We classify boundary bound
states. We generalize the Destri de Vega method to compute the ground state
energy of the theory on a finite interval. The second part deals with some
applications to condensed matter physics. We show how to compute analytically
time and space dependent correlations in one-dimensional quantum integrable
systems with an impurity. Our approach is based on a description of these
systems in terms of massless scattering of quasiparticles. Correlators follow
then from matrix elements of local operators between multiparticle states --
the massless form-factors. Although, in general an infinite sum of these
form-factors has to be considered, we find that for the current, spin and
energy operators only a few (two or three) are necessary to obtain an accuracy
of more than 1\%. Our results hold for arbitrary impurity strength, in contrary
to the perturbative expansions in the coupling constants. As an example, we
compute the frequency dependent condunctance, at zero temperature, in a
Luttinger liquid with an impurity, and also discuss the susceptibility in the
Kondo model and the time-dependent properties of the two-state problem with
dissipation.
