<title>
Quasiparticle excitations and hierarchies of 4-dimensional quantum Hall
  fluid states in the matrix models
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the condensate mechanism of the low-lying excitations in the
matrix models of 4-dimensional quantum Hall fluids recently proposed by us. It
is shown that there exist some hierarchies of 4-dimensional quantum Hall fluid
states in the matrix models, and they are similar to the Haldane's hierarchy in
the 2-dimensional quantum Hall fluids. However, these hierarchical fluid states
appear consistently in our matrix models without any requirement of
modifications of the matrix models.
