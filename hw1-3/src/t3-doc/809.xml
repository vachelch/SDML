D-brane probes on G2 Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider type IIB string theory on a seven dimensional orbifold with
holonomy in G2. The motivation is to use D1-branes as probes of the geometry.
The low energy theory on the D1-brane is a sigma-model with two real
supercharges (N = (1,1) in two dimensional language). We study in detail the
closed and open string sectors and propose a coupling of the twisted fields to
the brane that modifies the vacuum moduli space so that the singularity at the
origin is removed. Instead of coming from D-terms, which are not present here,
the modification comes from a ``twisted'' mass term for the seven scalar
multiplets on the brane. The proposed mechanism involves a generalization of
the moment map.
