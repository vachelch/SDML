Bound States of a Minimally Interacting Spin-0 and Spin-1/2 Constituent
  in the Instantaneous Approximation
</title>

<abstract>
  Bound-state solutions are obtained numerically in the instantaneous
approximation for a spin-0 and spin-1/2 constituent that interact via minimal
electrodynamics. To solve the integral equations in momentum space, a method is
developed for integrating over the logarithmic singularity in kernels, making
it possible to use basis functions that essentially automatically satisfy the
boundary conditions. For bound-state solutions that decrease rapidly at small
and large values of momentum, accurate solutions are obtained with
significantly fewer basis functions when the solution is expanded in terms of
these more general basis functions. The presence of a derivative coupling in
single-photon exchange complicates the construction of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation in the instantaneous approximation and, in the nonrelativistic limit,
gives rise to an additional electrostatic potential term that is second order
in the coupling constant and decreases as the square of the distance between
constituents.
