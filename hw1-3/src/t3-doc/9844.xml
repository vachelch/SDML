Noncommutative symmetric functions
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper presents a noncommutative theory of symmetric functions, based on
the notion of quasi-determinant. We begin with a formal theory, corresponding
to the case of symmetric functions in an infinite number of independent
variables. This allows us to endow the resulting algebra with a Hopf structure,
which leads to a new method for computing in descent algebras. It also gives
unified reinterpretation of a number of classical constructions. Next, we study
the noncommutative analogs of symmetric polynomials. One arrives at different
constructions, according to the particular kind of application under
consideration. For example, when a polynomial with noncommutative coefficients
in one central variable is decomposed as a product of linear factors, the roots
of these factors differ from those of the expanded polynomial. Thus, according
to whether one is interested in the construction of a polynomial with given
roots or in the expansion of a product of linear factors, one has to consider
two distinct specializations of the formal symmetric functions. A third type
appears when one looks for a noncommutative generalization of applications
related to the notion of characteristic polynomial of a matrix. This
construction can be applied, for instance, to the noncommutative matrices
formed by the generators of the universal enveloping algebra $U(gl_n)$ or of
