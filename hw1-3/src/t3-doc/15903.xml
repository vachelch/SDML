<title>
Zero-curvature representation for harmonic-superspace equations of
  motion in $N=1, D=6$ supersymmetric gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the $SYM^1_6$ harmonic-superspace system of equations that
contains superfield constraints and equations of motion for the simplest
six-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory. A special $A$-frame of the
analytic basis is introduced where a kinematic equation for the harmonic
connection $A^{\s--}$ can be solved . A dynamical equation in this frame is
equivalent to the zero-curvature equation corresponding to the covariant
conservation of analyticity. Using a simple harmonic gauge condition for the
gauge group $SU(2)$ we derive the superfield equations that produce the general
$SYM^1_6$ solution . An analogous approach for the analysis of integrability
conditions for the $SYM^2_4$-theory and $SYM$-supergravity-matter systems in
harmonic superspace is discussed briefly.
