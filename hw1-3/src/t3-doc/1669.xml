One-Loop Effective Action for Euclidean Maxwell Theory on Manifolds with
  Boundary
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper studies the one-loop effective action for Euclidean Maxwell theory
about flat four-space bounded by one three-sphere, or two concentric
three-spheres. The analysis relies on Faddeev-Popov formalism and
$\zeta$-function regularization, and the Lorentz gauge-averaging term is used
with magnetic boundary conditions. The contributions of transverse,
longitudinal and normal modes of the electromagnetic potential, jointly with
ghost modes, are derived in detail. The most difficult part of the analysis
consists in the eigenvalue condition given by the determinant of a $2 \times 2$
or $4 \times 4$ matrix for longitudinal and normal modes. It is shown that the
former splits into a sum of Dirichlet and Robin contributions, plus a simpler
term. This is the quantum cosmological case. In the latter case, however, when
magnetic boundary conditions are imposed on two bounding three-spheres, the
determinant is more involved. Nevertheless, it is evaluated explicitly as well.
The whole analysis provides the building block for studying the one-loop
effective action in covariant gauges, on manifolds with boundary. The final
result differs from the value obtained when only transverse modes are
quantized, or when noncovariant gauges are used.
