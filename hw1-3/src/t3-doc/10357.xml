<title>
The spectrum of a transfer matrix for loops
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the spectral properties of the transfer matrix for a gonihedric
random surface model on a three-dimensional lattice. The transfer matrix is
indexed by generalized loops in a natural fashion and is invariant under a
group of motions in loop-space. The eigenvalues of the transfer matrix can be
evaluated exactly in terms of the partition function, the internal energy and
the correlation functions of the two-dimensional Ising model and the
corresponding eigenfunctions are explicit functions on loop-space.
