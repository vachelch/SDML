A Stable Non-BPS Configuration From Intersecting Branes and Antibranes
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a tachyon-free stable non-BPS brane configuration in type IIA
string theory. The configuration is an elliptic model involving rotated NS5
branes, D4 branes and anti-D4 branes, and is dual to a fractional
brane-antibrane pair placed at a conifold singularity. This configuration
exhibits an interesting behaviour as we vary the radius of the compact
direction. Below a critical radius the D4 and anti-D4 branes are aligned, but
as the radius increases above the critical value the potential between them
develops a minimum away from zero. This signals a phase transition to a
configuration with finitely separated branes.
