<title>
Unconstrained Hamiltonian Formulation of SU(2) Gluodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory is considered in the framework of the
generalized Hamiltonian approach and the equivalent unconstrained system is
obtained using the method of Hamiltonian reduction. A canonical transformation
to a set of adapted coordinates is performed in terms of which the
Abelianization of the Gauss law constraints reduces to an algebraic operation
and the pure gauge degrees of freedom drop out from the Hamiltonian after
projection onto the constraint shell. For the remaining gauge invariant fields
two representations are introduced where the three fields which transform as
scalars under spatial rotations are separated from the three rotational fields.
An effective low energy nonlinear sigma model type Lagrangian is derived which
out of the six physical fields involves only one of the three scalar fields and
two rotational fields summarized in a unit vector. Its possible relation to the
effective Lagrangian proposed recently by Faddeev and Niemi is discussed.
Finally the unconstrained analog of the well-known nonnormalizable groundstate
wave functional which solves the Schr\"odinger equation with zero energy is
given and analysed in the strong coupling limit.
