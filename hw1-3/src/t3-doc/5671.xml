<title>
Supersymmetric sigma models and the 't Hooft instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  Witten's linear sigma model for ADHM instantons possesses a natural $(0,4)$
supersymmetry. We study generalizations of the infrared limit of the model that
are invariant under $(4,4)$ supersymmetry. In the case of four space-time
dimensions a background with a conformally flat metric and torsion is required.
The geometry is specified by a single real scalar function satisfying Laplace's
equation. It gives rise to 't Hooft instantons for the gauge group $SU(2)$,
instead of the general ADHM instantons for an $SO(n)$ gauge group in the case
$(0,4)$.
