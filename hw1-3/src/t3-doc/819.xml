Five-loop renormalization group functions of ${O}(n)$-symmetric
  $\phi^4$-theory and $\ep$-expansions of critical exponents up to $\ep^5$
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the discovery of errors in six of the 135 diagrams in the
published five-loop expansions of the $\beta$-function and the anomalous
dimensions of the ${O}(n)$-symmetric $\phi^4$-theory in $D=4-\ep$ dimensions we
present the results of a full analytic reevaluation of all diagrams. The
divergences are removed by minimal subtraction and $\ep$-expansions are given
for the critical exponents $\eta$, $\nu$, and $\omega$ up to order
$\epsilon^5$.
