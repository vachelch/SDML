On Smooth Time-Dependent Orbifolds and Null Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We study string theory on a non-singular time-dependent orbifold of flat
space, known as the `null-brane'. The orbifold group, which involves only
space-like identifications, is obtained by a combined action of a null Lorentz
transformation and a constant shift in an extra direction. In the limit where
the shift goes to zero, the geometry of this orbifold reproduces an orbifold
with a light-like singularity, which was recently studied by Liu, Moore and
Seiberg (hep-th/0204168). We find that the backreaction on the geometry due to
a test particle can be made arbitrarily small, and that there are scattering
processes which can be studied in the approximation of a constant background.
We quantize strings on this orbifold and calculate the torus partition
function. We construct a basis of states on the smooth orbifold whose tree
level string interactions are nonsingular. We discuss the existence of physical
modes in the singular orbifold which resolve the singularity. We also describe
another way of making the singular orbifold smooth which involves a sandwich
pp-wave.
