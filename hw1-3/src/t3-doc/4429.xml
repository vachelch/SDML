<title>
Hidden Symmetry of the Yang--Coulomb System
</title>

<abstract>
  The bound system composed of the Yang monopole coupled to a particle of the
isospin by the SU(2) and Coulomb interaction is considered. The generalized
Runge--Lenz vector and the SO(6) group of hidden symmetry are established. It
is also shown that the group of hidden symmetry make it possible to calculate
the spectrum of the system by a pure algebraic method.
