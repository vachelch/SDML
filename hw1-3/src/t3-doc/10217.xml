Twisted Sectors and Chern-Simons Terms in M-Theory Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the twisted sector spectrum, as well as the associated
Chern-Simons interactions, can be determined on M-theory orbifold fixed planes
that do not admit gravitational anomalies. This is demonstrated for the
seven-planes arising within the context of an explicit $R^6 \times S^1/Z_2
\times T^4/Z_2$ orbifold, although the results are completely general. Local
anomaly cancellation in this context is shown to require fractional anomaly
data that can only arise from a twisted sector on the seven-planes, thus
determining the twisted spectrum up to a small ambiguity. These results open
the door to the construction of arbitrary M-theory orbifolds, including those
containing fixed four-planes which are of phenomenological interest.
