<title>
Rotating D3-branes and QCD in three dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the rotating D3-brane solution with maximum number of angular
momentum parameters. After determining the angular velocities, Hawking
temperature, ADM mass and entropy, we use this geometry to construct general
three-parameter models of non-supersymmetric pure SU(N) Yang-Mills theories in
2+1 dimensions. We calculate glueball masses in the WKB approximation and
obtain closed analytic expressions for generic values of the parameters. We
also determine the masses of Kaluza--Klein states associated with internal
parts of the ten-dimensional metric and investigate the parameter region where
some of these states are decoupled. To leading order in 1/\lambda and 1/N
(where \lambda is the 't Hooft coupling) we find a global U(1)^3 symmetry and
states with masses comparable to glueball masses, which have no counterpart in
the more familiar (finite \lambda, N) Yang-Mills theories.
