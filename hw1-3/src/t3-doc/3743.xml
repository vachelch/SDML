<title>
Instantons in Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The known calculations of the fermion condensate $<\bar{\psi}\psi>$ and the
correlator $<\bar{\psi}\psi(x) ~\bar{\psi}\psi(0)>$ have been interpreted in
terms of {\em localized} instanton solutions minimizing the {\em effective}
action. Their size is of order of massive photon Compton wavelength $\mu^{-1}$.
At high temperature, these instantons become quasistatic and present the
2-dimensional analog of the `walls' found recently in 4-dimensional gauge
theories. In spite of the static nature of these solutions, they should not be
interpreted as `thermal solitons' living in Minkowski space: the mass of these
would-be solitons does not display itself in the physical correlators. At small
but nonzero fermion mass, the high-T partition function of $QED_2$ is saturated
by the rarefied gas of instantons and antiinstantons with density $\propto
m~\exp\{-S^{inst.}\}~=~m~\exp\{-\pi T/\mu\}$ to be confronted with the dense
strongly correlated instanton-antiinstanton liquid saturating the partition
function at $T=0$.
