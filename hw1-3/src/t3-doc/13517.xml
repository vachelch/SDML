<title>
The Large N Random Phase sine-Gordon Model
</title>

<abstract>
  At large distances and in the low temperature phase, the quenched correlation
functions in the 2d random phase sine-Gordon model have been argued to be of
the form~: $ \bar {\vev{~[\varphi(x)-\varphi(0)]^2~}}_* = A (\log|x|) + B \ep^2
(\log|x|)^2 $, with $\ep=(T-T_c)$. However, renormalization group computations
predict $B\not=0$ while variational approaches (which are supposed to be exact
for models with a large number of components) give $B=0$. We introduce a large
$N$ version of the random phase sine-Gordon model. Using non-Abelian
bosonization and renormalization group techniques, we show that the correlation
functions of our models have the above form but with a coefficient $B$
suppressed by a factor $1/N^3$ compared to $A$.
