Integrable flows in c=1 string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In these notes we review the method to construct integrable deformations of
the compactified c=1 bosonic string theory by primary fields (momentum or
winding modes), developed recently in collaboration with S. Alexandrov and V.
Kazakov. The method is based on the formulation of the string theory as a
matrix model. The flows generated by either momentum or winding modes (but not
both) are integrable and satisfy the Toda lattice hierarchy.
