Tilting the Noncommutative Bion
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note, we extend the noncommutative bion core solution of Constable,
Myers and Tafjord (hep-th/9911136) to include the effects of a nonzero NS-NS
two-form B. The result is a `tilted bion' in which the core expands out to a
single D3-brane at an angle to the D1-brane core. Its properties agree
perfectly with an analysis of the dual situation, that of a magnetic charge on
an abelian D3-brane in a background worldvolume magnetic field. We also
demonstrate that this agreement extends beyond geometry to include the field
strength on the D3-brane. We make a proposal for including possible worldvolume
gauge fields when mapping a noncommutative geometrical brane solution onto a
corresponding commutative brane description.
