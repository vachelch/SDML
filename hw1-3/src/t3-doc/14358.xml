<title>
A Derivation of the Correct Treatment of 1/(eta.k)^p Singularities in
  Axial Gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the earlier results on the correlations of axial gauge Green's
functions and the Lorentz gauge Green's functions obtained via finite
field-dependent BRS transformations to study the question of the correct
treatment of 1/(eta\cdot k)^p- type singularities in the axial gauge boson
propagator. We show how the known treatment of the 1/(k^2)^n-type singularity
in the Lorentz-type gauges can be used to write down the axial propagator via
field transformation. We examine the singularity structure of the latter and
find that the axial propagator so constructed has $no$ spurious poles, but a
complex structure near $\eta\cdot k=0$.
