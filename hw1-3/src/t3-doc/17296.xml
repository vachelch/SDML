On the Twisted (2,0) and Little-String Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the compactification of the $(2,0)$ and type-II little-string
theories on $S^1$, $T^2$ and $T^3$ with an R-symmetry twist that preserves half
the supersymmetry. We argue that it produces the same moduli spaces of vacua as
compactification of the $(1,0)$ theory with $E_8$ Wilson lines given by a
maximal embedding of SU(2). In certain limits, this reproduces the moduli space
of SU(2) with a massive adjoint hyper-multiplet. In the type-II little-string
theory case, we observe a peculiar phase transition where the strings condense.
We conjecture a generalization to more than two 5-branes which involves
instantons on non-commutative $T^4$. We conclude with open questions.
