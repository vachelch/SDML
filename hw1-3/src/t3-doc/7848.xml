Fusion in coset CFT from admissible singular-vector decoupling
</title>

<abstract>
  Fusion rules for Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models at fractional level can be
defined in two ways, with distinct results. The Verlinde formula yields fusion
coefficients that can be negative. These signs cancel in coset fusion rules,
however. On the other hand, the fusion coefficients calculated from decoupling
of singular vectors are non-negative. They produce incorrect coset fusion
rules, however, when factorisation is assumed. Here we give two prescriptions
that yield the correct coset fusion rules from those found for the WZW models
by the decoupling method. We restrict to the Virasoro minimal models for
simplicity, and because decoupling results are only complete in the $\su(2)$
case.
