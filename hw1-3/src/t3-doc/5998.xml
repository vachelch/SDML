<title>
On the Moduli Space of Noncommutative Multi-solitons at Finite Theta
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the finite theta correction to the metric of the moduli space of
noncommutative multi-solitons in scalar field theory in (2+1) dimensions. By
solving the equation of motion up to order O(theta^{-2}) explicitly, we show
that the multi-soliton solution must have the same center for a generic
potential term. We examine the condition that the multi-centered configurations
are allowed. Under this condition, we calculate the finite theta correction to
the metric of the moduli space of multi-solitons and argue the possibility of
the non right-angle scattering of two solitons. We also obtain the potential
between two solitons.
