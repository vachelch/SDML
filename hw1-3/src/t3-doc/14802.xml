<title>
Non-zeta knots in the renormalization of the Wess-Zumino model?
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve the Schwinger Dyson equations of the O(N) symmetric Wess-Zumino
model at O(1/N^3) at the non-trivial fixed point of the d-dimensional
beta-function and deduce a critical exponent for the wave function
renormalization at this order. By developing the epsilon-expansion of the
result, which agrees with known perturbation theory, we examine the
distribution of transcendental coefficients and show that only the Riemann zeta
series arises at this order in 1/N. Unlike the analogous calculation at the
same order in the bosonic O(N) phi^4-theory non-zeta transcendentals,
associated with for example the (3,4)-torus knot, cancel.
