Supergravity and a Confining Gauge Theory: Duality Cascades and
  $\chi$SB-Resolution of Naked Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We revisit the singular IIB supergravity solution describing M fractional
3-branes on the conifold [hep-th/0002159]. Its 5-form flux decreases, which we
explain by showing that the relevant \NN=1 SUSY SU(N+M)xSU(N) gauge theory
undergoes repeated Seiberg-duality transformations in which N -> N-M. Far in
the IR the gauge theory confines; its chiral symmetry breaking removes the
singularity of hep-th/0002159 by deforming the conifold. We propose a
non-singular pure-supergravity background dual to the field theory on all
scales, with small curvature everywhere if the `t Hooft coupling g_s M is
large. In the UV it approaches that of hep-th/0002159, incorporating the
logarithmic flow of couplings. In the IR the deformation of the conifold gives
a geometrical realization of chiral symmetry breaking and confinement. We
suggest that pure \NN=1 Yang-Mills may be dual to strings propagating at small
g_s M on a warped deformed conifold. We note also that the standard model
itself may lie at the base of a duality cascade.
