<title>
One-loop renormalizability of all 2d dimensional Poisson-Lie
  sigma-models
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a systematic study of the one-loop renormalizability of all
Poisson-Lie T-dualizable $\si$-models with two-dimensional targets. We show
that whatever Drinfeld double and whatever matrix of coupling constants we
consider the corresponding $\si$-model is always one-loop renormalizable in the
strict field theoretical sense. Moreover, in all cases, the RG flow in the
space of the coupling constants is compatible with the Poisson-Lie T-duality.
