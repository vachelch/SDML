<title>
Extremal Transitions and Five-Dimensional Supersymmetric Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study five-dimensional supersymmetric field theories with one-dimensional
Coulomb branch. We extend a previous analysis which led to non-trivial fixed
points with $E_n$ symmetry ($E_8$, $E_7$, $E_6$, $E_5=Spin(10)$, $E_4=SU(5)$,
$E_3=SU(3)\times SU(2)$, $E_2=SU(2)\times U(1)$ and $E_1=SU(2)$) by finding two
new theories: $\tilde E_1$ with $U(1)$ symmetry and $E_0$ with no symmetry. The
latter is a non-trivial theory with no relevant operators preserving the
super-Poincar\'e symmetry. In terms of string theory these new field theories
enable us to describe compactifications of the type I' theory on
$S^1/Z_2$ with 16, 17 or 18 background D8-branes. These theories also play
a crucial role in compactifications of M-theory on Calabi--Yau spaces,
providing physical models for the contractions of del Pezzo surfaces to points
(thereby completing the classification of singularities which can occur at
codimension one in K\"ahler moduli). The structure of the Higgs branch yields a
prediction which unifies the known mathematical facts about del Pezzo
transitions in a quite remarkable way.
