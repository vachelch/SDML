<title>
A Coherent State Path Integral for Anyons
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive an $su(1,1)$ coherent state path integral formula for a system of
two one-dimensional anyons in a harmonic potential. By a change of variables we
transform this integral into a coherent states path integral for a harmonic
oscillator with a shifted energy. The shift is the same as the one obtained for
anyons by other methods. We justify the procedure by showing that the change of
variables corresponds to a $su(1,1)$ version of the Holstein-Primakoff
transformation.
