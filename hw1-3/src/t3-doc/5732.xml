<title>
Quantum spinor field in the FRW universe with a constant electromagnetic
  background
</title>

<abstract>
  The article is a natural continuation of our paper {\em Quantum scalar field
in FRW Universe with constant electromagnetic background}, Int. J. Mod. Phys.
{\bf A12}, 4837 (1997). We generalize the latter consideration to the case of
massive spinor field, which is placed in FRW Universe of special type with a
constant electromagnetic field. To this end special sets of exact solutions of
Dirac equation in the background under consideration are constructed and
classified. Using these solutions representations for out-in, in-in, and
out-out spinor Green functions are explicitly constructed as proper-time
integrals over the corresponding contours in complex proper-time plane. The
vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude and number of created particles are found
and vacuum instability is discussed. The mean values of the current and
energy-momentum tensor are evaluated, and different approximations for them are
presented. The back reaction related to particle creation and to the
polarization of the unstable vacuum is estimated in different regimes.
