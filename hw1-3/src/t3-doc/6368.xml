Bosonized Massive N-flavor Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The massive N-flavor Schwinger model is analyzed by the bosonization method.
The problem is reduced to the quantum mechanics of N degrees of freedom in
which the potential needs to be self-consistently determined by its
ground-state wave function and spectrum with given values of the $\theta$
parameter, fermion masses, and temperature. Boson masses and fermion chiral
condensates are evaluated. In the N=1 model the anomalous behavior is found at
$\theta \sim \pi$ and $m/\mu \sim 0.4$. In the N=3 model an asymmetry in
fermion masses $(m_1 < m_2 \ll m_3)$ removes the singularity at $\theta=\pi$
and T=0. The chiral condensates at $\theta=0$ are insensitive to the asymmetry
in fermion masses, but are significantly sensitive at $\theta=\pi$. The
resultant picture is similar to that obtained in QCD by the chiral Lagrangian
method.
