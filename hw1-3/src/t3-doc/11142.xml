Principles of Discrete Time Mechanics: IV. The Dirac Equation, Particles
  and Oscillons
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the principles of discrete time mechanics discussed in earlier
papers to the first and second quantised Dirac equation. We use the Schwinger
action principle to find the anticommutation relations of the Dirac field and
of the particle creation operators in the theory. We find new solutions to the
discrete time Dirac equation, referred to as oscillons on account of their
extraordinary behaviour. Their principal characteristic is that they oscillate
with a period twice that of the fundamental time interval T of our theory.
Although these solutions can be associated with definite charge, linear
momentum and spin, such objects should not be observable as particles in the
continuous time limit. We find that for non-zero T they correspond to states
with negative squared norm in Hilbert space. However they are an integral part
of the discrete time Dirac field and should play a role in particle
interactions analogous to the role of longitudinal photons in conventional
quantum electrodynamics.
