Brane Networks in AdS Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We present static solutions to Einstein's equations corresponding to the most
general network of $N$ orthogonal families of $(2+N)$-branes in
$(4+N)$-dimensional $AdS$ spacetimes. The bulk cosmological constant can take a
different value in each cell enclosed by intersecting branes and the extra
dimensions can be compact or noncompact. In each family of branes the
inter-brane spacing is arbitrary. The extra dimensions may be any or all of the
manifolds, $R^1$, $R^1/Z_2$, $S^1$ and $S^1/Z_2$. Only when the extra
dimensions are $R^1$ or/and $R^1/Z_2$, can networks consisting solely of
positive tension branes be constructed. Such configurations may find
application in models with localized gravity and symmetry breaking by shining.
