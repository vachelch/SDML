QCD Confinement and Theta Vacuum: Dynamical Spontaneous Symmetry
  Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  This study proposes that the longstanding problems of quantum chromodynamics
(QCD) as an SU(3)_C gauge theory, the confinement mechanism and \Theta vacuum,
can be resolved by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking (DSSB) through the
condensation of singlet gluons and quantum nucleardynamics (QND) as an SU(2)_N
x U(1)_Z gauge theory is produced. The confinement mechanism is the result of
massive gluons and the Yukawa potential provides hadron formation. The
evidences for the breaking of discrete symmetries (C, P, T, CP) during DSSB
appear explicitly: baryons and mesons without their parity partners, the
conservation of vector current and the partial conservation of the axial vector
current, the baryon asymmetry \delta_B \simeq 10^{-10}, and the neutron
electric dipole moment \Theta < 10^{-9}. Hadron mass generation mechanism is
suggested in terms of DSSB due to the \Theta vacuum.
