<title>
Italian workshop on quantum groups
</title>

<abstract>
  The first ``Convegno Informale su Quantum Groups'' was held in Florence from
February 3 to 6, 1993. This Convegno was conceived as an informal meeting to
bring together all the italian people working in the field of quantum groups
and related topics. We are very happy indeed that about 30 theoretical
physicists decided to take part presenting many aspects of this interesting and
live subject of research. We thank all the participants for the stimulating and
nice atmosphere that has characterized the meeting. This paper has the intent
to give a quick review in english of the contributions and related references.
We think useful to include the complete addresses and coordinate data of the
participants. It is our intention to diffuse these proceedings by e-mail trough
electronic data banks.
