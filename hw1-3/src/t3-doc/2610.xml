The Euclidean Hopf algebra $U_q(e^N)$ and its fundamental Hilbert space
  representations
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the Euclidean Hopf algebra $U_q(e^N)$ dual of
$Fun(\rn_q^N\lcross SO_{q^{-1}}(N))$ by realizing it as a subalgebra of the
differential algebra $\DFR$ on the quantum Euclidean space $\rn_q^N$; in fact,
we extend our previous realization \cite{fio4} of $U_{q^{-1}}(so(N))$ within
$\DFR$ through the introduction of q-derivatives as generators of
q-translations. The fundamental Hilbert space representations of $U_q(e^N)$
turn out to be of highest weight type and rather simple `` lattice-regularized
'' versions of the classical ones. The vectors of a basis of the singlet (i.e.
zero-spin) irrep can be realized as normalizable functions on $\rn_q^N$, going
to distributions in the limit $q\rightarrow 1$.
