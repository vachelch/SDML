<title>
Intersecting 5-brane solution of N=1, D=10 Dual Supergravity with
  \alpha' corrections
</title>

<abstract>
  A vacuum solution of anomaly-free N=1, D=10 Dual Supergravity is constructed.
This vacuum corresponds to the presence of two 5-branes, intersecting along
M_4, and possesses N=1, D=4 supersymmetry.
