M-theory on Manifolds of G_2 Holonomy and Type IIA Orientifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate that M-theory compactifications on 7-manifolds of G_2
holonomy, which yield 4d N=1 supersymmetric systems, often admit at special
loci in their moduli space a description as type IIA orientifolds. In this way,
we are able to find new dualities of special IIA orientifolds, including
dualities which relate orientifolds of IIA strings on manifolds of different
topology with different numbers of wrapped D-branes. We also discuss models
which incorporate, in a natural way, compact embeddings of gauge theory/gravity
dualities similar to those studied in the recent work of Atiyah, Maldacena and
Vafa.
