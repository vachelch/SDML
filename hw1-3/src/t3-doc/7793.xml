<title>
Quaternionic and Octonionic Spinors. A Classification
</title>

<abstract>
  Quaternionic and octonionic realizations of Clifford algebras and spinors are
classified and explicitly constructed in terms of recursive formulas. The most
general free dynamics in arbitrary signature space-times for both quaternionic
and octonionic spinors is presented. In the octonionic case we further provide
a systematic list of results and tables expressing, e.g., the relations of the
octonionic Clifford algebras with the $G_2$ cosets over the Lorentz algebras,
the identities satisfied by the higher-rank antisymmetric octonionic tensors
and so on. Applications of these results range from the classification of
octonionic generalized supersymmetries, the construction of octonionic
superstrings, as well as the investigations concerning the recently discovered
octonionic $M$-superalgebra and its superconformal extension.
