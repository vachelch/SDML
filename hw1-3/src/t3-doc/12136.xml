Towards cohomology of renormalization: bigrading the combinatorial Hopf
  algebra of rooted trees
</title>

<abstract>
  The renormalization of quantum field theory twists the antipode of a
noncocommutative Hopf algebra of rooted trees, decorated by an infinite set of
primitive divergences. The Hopf algebra of undecorated rooted trees, ${\cal
H}_R$, generated by a single primitive divergence, solves a universal problem
in Hochschild cohomology. It has two nontrivial closed Hopf subalgebras: the
cocommutative subalgebra ${\cal H}_{\rm ladder}$ of pure ladder diagrams and
the Connes-Moscovici noncocommutative subalgebra ${\cal H}_{\rm CM}$ of
noncommutative geometry. These three Hopf algebras admit a bigrading by $n$,
the number of nodes, and an index $k$ that specifies the degree of primitivity.
In each case, we use iterations of the relevant coproduct to compute the
dimensions of subspaces with modest values of $n$ and $k$ and infer a simple
generating procedure for the remainder. The results for ${\cal H}_{\rm ladder}$
are familiar from the theory of partitions, while those for ${\cal H}_{\rm CM}$
involve novel transforms of partitions. Most beautiful is the bigrading of
${\cal H}_R$, the largest of the three. Thanks to Sloane's {\tt superseeker},
we discovered that it saturates all possible inequalities. We prove this by
using the universal Hochschild-closed one-cocycle $B_+$, which plugs one set of
divergences into another, and by generalizing the concept of natural growth
beyond that entailed by the Connes-Moscovici case. We emphasize the yet greater
challenge of handling the infinite set of decorations of realistic quantum
field theory.
