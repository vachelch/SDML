Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Supersymmetric SU(n_c) and USp(2n_c)
  Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the phase and flavor symmetry breaking pattern of each N=1
supersymmetric vacuum of SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) gauge theories, constructed
from the exactly solvable N=2 theories by perturbing them with small adjoint
and generic bare hypermultiplet (quark) masses. In SU(n_c) theories with n_f
\leq n_c the vacua are labelled by an integer r, in which the flavor U(n_f)
symmetry is dynamically broken to U(r) \times U(n_f-r) in the limit of
vanishing bare hyperquark masses. In the r=1 vacua the dynamical symmetry
breaking is caused by the condensation of magnetic monopoles in the n_f
representation. For general r, however, the monopoles in the {}_{n_f}C_r
representation, whose condensation could explain the flavor symmetry breaking
but would produce too-many Nambu--Goldstone multiplets, actually "break up"
into "magnetic quarks": the latter with nonabelian interactions condense and
induce confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking. In USp(2n_c) theories with
n_f \leq n_c + 1, the flavor SO(2n_f) symmetry is dynamically broken to U(n_f),
but with no description in terms of a weakly coupled local field theory. In
both SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) theories, with larger numbers of quark flavors,
besides the vacua with these properties, there exist also vacua in free
magnetic phase, with unbroken global symmetry.
