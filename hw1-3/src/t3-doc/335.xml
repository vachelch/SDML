Aharonov-Bohm Effect in Noncommutative Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The Aharonov-Bohm effect on the noncommutative plane is considered.
Developing the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, we find the
propagation amplitude for a particle in a noncommutative space. We show that
the corresponding shift in the phase of the particle propagator due to the
magnetic field of a thin solenoid receives certain gauge invariant corrections
because of the noncommutativity. Evaluating the numerical value for this
correction, an upper bound for the noncommutativity parameter is obtained.
