<title>
Can fusion coefficients be calculated from the depth rule ?
</title>

<abstract>
  The depth rule is a level truncation of tensor product coefficients expected
to be sufficient for the evaluation of fusion coefficients. We reformulate the
depth rule in a precise way, and show how, in principle, it can be used to
calculate fusion coefficients. However, we argue that the computation of the
depth itself, in terms of which the constraints on tensor product coefficients
is formulated, is problematic. Indeed, the elements of the basis of states
convenient for calculating tensor product coefficients do not have a
well-defined depth! We proceed by showing how one can calculate the depth in an
`approximate' way and derive accurate lower bounds for the minimum level at
which a coupling appears. It turns out that this method yields exact results
for $\widehat{su}(3)$ and constitutes an efficient and simple algorithm for
computing $\widehat{su}(3)$ fusion coefficients.
