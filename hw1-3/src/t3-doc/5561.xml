Fivebranes Wrapped on SLAG Three-Cycles and Related Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct ten-dimensional supergravity solutions corresponding to the near
horizon limit of IIB fivebranes wrapping special Lagrangian three-cycles of
constant curvature. The case of branes wrapping a three-sphere provides a
gravity dual of pure N=2 super-Yang-Mills theory in D=3. The non-trivial part
of the solutions are seven manifolds that admit two G_2 structures each of
which is covariantly constant with respect to a different connection with
torsion. We derive a formula for the generalised calibration for this general
class of solutions. We discuss analogous aspects of the geometry that arises
when fivebranes wrap other supersymmetric cycles which lead to Spin(7) and
SU(N) structures. In some cases there are two covariantly constant structures
and in others one.
