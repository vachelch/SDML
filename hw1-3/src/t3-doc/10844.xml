<title>
Open strings, Born--Infeld action and the heat kernel
</title>

<abstract>
  In the derivation of the Born-Infeld action for the case with a nontrivial
boundary of the string world sheet the appearance of a new term changes the
conformal anomaly. This may have many consequences, especially also in the
study of generalized interacting brane systems.
