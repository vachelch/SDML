Non-Abelian Monopole and Dyon Solutions in a Modified
  Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs System
</title>

<abstract>
  We have studied a modified Yang-Mills-Higgs system coupled to Einstein
gravity. The modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action involves a direct
coupling of the Higgs field to the scalar curvature. In this modified system we
are able to write a Bogomol'nyi type condition in curved space and demonstrate
that the positive static energy functional is bounded from below. We then
investigate non-Abelian sperically symmetric static solutions in a similar
fashion to the `t Hooft-Polyakov monopole. After reviewing previously studied
monopole solutions of this type, we extend the formalism to included electric
charge and we present dyon solutions.
