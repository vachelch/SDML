Supersymmetric Two-Time Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an Sp(2,R) gauge invariant particle action which possesses
manifest space-time SO(d,2) symmetry, global supersymmetry and kappa
supersymmetry. The global and local supersymmetries are non-abelian
generalizations of Poincare type supersymmetries and are consistent with the
presence of two timelike dimensions. In particular, this action provides a
unified and explicit superparticle representation of the superconformal groups
OSp(N/4), SU(2,2/N) and OSp(8*/N) which underlie various AdS/CFT dualities in
M/string theory. By making diverse Sp(2,R) gauge choices our action reduces to
diverse one-time physics systems, one of which is the ordinary (one-time)
massless superparticle with superconformal symmetry that we discuss explicitly.
We show how to generalize our approach to the case of superalgebras, such as
OSp(1/32), which do not have direct space-time interpretations in terms of only
zero branes, but may be realizable in the presence of p-branes.
