Black hole p-brane solutions for general intersection rules
</title>

<abstract>
  Black hole generalized p-brane solutions for a wide class of intersection
rules are obtained. The solutions are defined on a manifold that contains a
product of n - 1 Ricci-flat ``internal'' spaces. They are defined up to a set
of functions H_s obeying a non-linear differential equations (equivalent to
Toda-type equations) with certain boundary conditions imposed. A conjecture on
polynomial structure of governing functions H_s for intersections related to
semisimple Lie algebras is suggested. This conjecture is proved for Lie
algebras: A_m, C_{m+1}, m = 1,2,... Explicit formulas for A_2-solution are
obtained. Two examples of A_2-dyon solutions (e.g. dyon in D = 11 supergravity
and Kaluza-Klein dyon) are considered. Post-Newtonian parameters "beta" and
"gamma" corresponding to 4-dimensional section of the metric are calculated. It
is shown that "beta" does not depend upon intersections of p-branes. Extremal
black hole configurations are also considered.
