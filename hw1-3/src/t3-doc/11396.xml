Noncommutative Lattices as Finite Approximations and Their
  Noncommutative Geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  Lattice discretizations of continuous manifolds are common tools used in a
variety of physical contexts. Conventional discrete approximations, however,
cannot capture all aspects of the original manifold, notably its topology. In
this paper we discuss an approximation scheme due to Sorkin which correctly
reproduces important topological aspects of continuum physics. The
approximating topological spaces are partially ordered sets (posets), the
partial order encoding the topology. Now, the topology of a manifold $M$ can be
reconstructed from the commutative C*-algebra $\cc(M)$ of continuous functions
defined on it. In turn, this algebra is generated by continuous probability
densities in ordinary quantum physics on $M$. The latter also serve to specify
the domains of observables like the Hamiltonian. For a poset, the role of this
algebra is assumed by a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra $\ca $. This fact makes
any poset a genuine `noncommutative' (`quantum') space, in the sense that the
algebra of its `continuous functions' is a noncommutative C$^*$-algebra. We
therefore also have a remarkable connection between finite approximations to
quantum physics and noncommutative geometries. We use this connection to
develop various approximation methods for doing quantum physics using $\ca$.
