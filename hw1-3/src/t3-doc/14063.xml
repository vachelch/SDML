Logarithmic Correction to Newton Potential in Randall-Sundrum Scenario
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a fixed-energy amplitude in Randall-Sundrum single brane scenario, we
compute the Newton potential on the brane. It is shown that the correction
terms to the Newton potential involve a logarithmic factor. Especially, when
the distance between two point masses are very small compared to $AdS$ radius,
the contribution of KK spectrum becomes dominant compared to the usual
inversely square law. This fact may be used to prove the existence of an extra
dimension experimentally.
