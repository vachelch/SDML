<title>
Higher-spin strings and W minimal models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the spectrum of physical states for higher-spin generalisations of
string theory, based on two-dimensional theories with local spin-2 and spin-$s$
symmetries. We explore the relation of the resulting effective Virasoro string
theories to certain $W$ minimal models. In particular, we show how the
highest-weight states of the $W$ minimal models decompose into Virasoro
primaries.
