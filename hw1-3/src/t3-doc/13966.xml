<title>
Faddeev-Popov determinant in 2-dimensional Regge gravity.
</title>

<abstract>
  By regularizing the singularities appearing in the two dimensional Regge
calculus by means of a segment of a sphere or pseudo-sphere and then taking the
regulator to zero, we obtain a simple formula for the gauge volume which
appears in the functional integral. Such a formula is an analytic function of
the opening of the conic singularity in the interval from $\pi$ to $4\pi$ and
in the continuum limit it goes over to the correct result.
