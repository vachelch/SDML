<title>
On Lorentz Invariant Actions for Chiral P-Forms
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate how a Lorentz covariant formulation of the chiral p-form model
in D=2(p+1) containing infinitely many auxiliary fields is related to a Lorentz
covariant formulation with only one auxiliary scalar field entering a chiral
p-form action in a nonpolynomial way. The latter can be regarded as a
consistent Lorentz-covariant truncation of the former. We make the Hamiltonian
analysis of the model based on the nonpolynomial action and show that the Dirac
constraints have a simple form and are all of the first class. In contrast to
the Siegel model the constraints are not the square of second-class
constraints. The canonical Hamiltonian is quadratic and determines energy of a
single chiral p-form. In the case of d=2 chiral scalars the constraint can be
improved by use of `twisting' procedure (without the loss of the property to be
of the first class) in such a way that the central charge of the quantum
constraint algebra is zero. This points to possible absence of anomaly in an
appropriate quantum version of the model.
