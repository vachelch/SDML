<title>
Low-energy scattering of extremal black holes by neutral matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the decay of a spherically symmetric near-extremal charged
black hole, including back-reaction effects, in the near-horizon region. The
non-locality of the effective action controlling this process allows and also
forces us to introduce a complementary set of boundary conditions which permit
to determine the asymptotic late time Hawking flux. The evaporation rate goes
down exponentially and admits an infinite series expansion in Planck's
constant. At leading order it is proportional to the total mass and the higher
order terms involve higher order momenta of the classical stress-tensor.
Moreover we use this late time behaviour to go beyond the near-horizon
approximation and comment on the implications for the information loss paradox.
