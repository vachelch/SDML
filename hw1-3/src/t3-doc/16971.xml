Quantum M^2 -> 2Lambda/3 discontinuity for massive gravity with a Lambda
  term
</title>

<abstract>
  In a previous paper we showed that the absence of the van
Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity as M^2 -> 0 for massive spin-2 with a Lambda
term is an artifact of the tree approximation, and that the discontinuity
reappears at one loop, as a result of going from five degrees of freedom to
two. In this paper we show that a similar classical continuity but quantum
discontinuity arises in the "partially massless" limit M^2 -> 2Lambda/3, as a
result of going from five degrees of freedom to four.
