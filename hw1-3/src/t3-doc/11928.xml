Enhancons, Fuzzy Spheres and Multi-Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the `enhancon', a spherical hypersurface apparently made of
D-branes, which arises in string theory studies of large N SU(N) pure gauge
theories with eight supercharges. When the gauge theory is 2+1 dimensional, the
enhancon is an S^2. A relation to charge N BPS multi-monopoles is exploited to
uncover many of its detailed properties. It is simply a spherical slice through
an Atiyah-Hitchin-like submanifold of the charge $N$ BPS monopole moduli space.
In the form of Nahm data, it is built from the N dimensional irreducible
representation of SU(2). In this sense the enhancon is a non-commutative
sphere, reminiscent of the spherical `dielectric' branes of Myers.
