<title>
Discrete Physics and the Dirac Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We rewrite the 1+1 Dirac equation in light cone coordinates in two
significant forms, and solve them exactly using the classical calculus of
finite differences. The complex form yields ``Feynman's Checkerboard''---a
weighted sum over lattice paths. The rational, real form can also be
interpreted in terms of bit-strings.
