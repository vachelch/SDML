<title>
Quasi-classical limit of Toda hierarchy and W-infinity symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  Previous results on quasi-classical limit of the KP hierarchy and its
W-infinity symmetries are extended to the Toda hierarchy. The Planck constant
$\hbar$ now emerges as the spacing unit of difference operators in the Lax
formalism. Basic notions, such as dressing operators, Baker-Akhiezer functions
and tau function, are redefined. $W_{1+\infty}$ symmetries of the Toda
hierarchy are realized by suitable rescaling of the Date-Jimbo-Kashiara-Miwa
vertex operators. These symmetries are contracted to $w_{1+\infty}$ symmetries
of the dispersionless hierarchy through their action on the tau function. (A
few errors in the earlier version is corrected.)
