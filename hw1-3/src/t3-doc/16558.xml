<title>
Bicovariant differential geometry of the quantum group GL_q(3)
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a bicovariant differential calculus on the quantum group
$GL_q(3)$, and discuss its restriction to $[SU(3) \otimes U(1)]_q$. The
$q$-algebra of Lie derivatives is found, as well as the Cartan-Maurer
equations. All the quantities characterizing the non-commutative geometry of
$GL_q(3)$ are given explicitly.
