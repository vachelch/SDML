<title>
\$tring Theory and an Accelerating Universe
</title>

<abstract>
  An accelerating Universe can be accommodated naturally within non-critical
string theory, in which scattering is described by a superscattering matrix \$
that does not factorize as a product of $S$- and $S^\dagger$-matrix elements
and time evolution is described by a modified Liouville equation characteristic
of open quantum-mechanical systems. We describe briefly alternative
representations in terms of the stochastic Ito and Fokker-Planck equations. The
link between the vacuum energy and the departure from criticality is stressed.
We give an explicit example in which non-marginal \$tring couplings cause a
departure from criticality, and the corresponding cosmological vacuum energy
relaxes to zero \`a la quintessence.
