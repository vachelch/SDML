Quantum antibrackets
</title>

<abstract>
  A binary expression in terms of operators is given which satisfies all the
quantum counterparts of the algebraic properties of the classical antibracket.
This quantum antibracket has therefore the same relation to the classical
antibracket as commutators to Poisson brackets. It is explained how this
quantum antibracket is related to the classical antibracket and the
\Delta-operator in the BV-quantization. Higher quantum antibrackets are
introduced in terms of generating operators, which automatically yield all
their subsequent Jacobi identities as well as the consistent Leibniz' rules.
