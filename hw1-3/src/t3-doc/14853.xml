Open Strings and D-branes in WZNW model
</title>

<abstract>
  An abundance of the Poisson-Lie symmetries of the WZNW models is uncovered.
They give rise, via the Poisson-Lie $T$-duality, to a rich structure of the
dual pairs of $D$-branes configurations in group manifolds. The $D$-branes are
characterized by their shapes and certain two-forms living on them. The WZNW
path integral for the interacting $D$-branes diagrams is unambiguously defined
if the two-form on the $D$-brane and the WZNW three-form on the group form an
integer-valued cocycle in the relative singular cohomology of the group
manifold with respect to its $D$-brane submanifold. An example of the $SU(N)$
WZNW model is studied in some detail.
