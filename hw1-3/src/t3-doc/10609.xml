Solutions to the Massive HLW IIA Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We find new supersymmetric solutions of the massive supergravity theory which
can be constructed by generalized Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction of
eleven dimensional supergravity, using the scaling symmetry of the equations of
motion. Firstly, we construct field configurations which solve the ten
dimensional equations of motion by reducing on the radial direction of
Ricci-flat cones. Secondly, we will extend this result to the supersymmetric
case by performing a dimensional reduction along the flow of a homothetic
Killing vector which is the Euler vector of the cone plus a boost.
