CFT and Entropy on the Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a brane-universe in the background of an Anti-de Sitter/
Schwarschild geometry. We show that the induced geometry of the brane is
exactly given by that of a standard radiation dominated FRW-universe. The
radiation is represented by a strongly coupled CFT with an AdS-dual
description. We show that when the brane crosses the horizon of the AdS-black
hole the entropy and temperature are simply expressed in the Hubble constant
and its time derivative. We present formulas for the entropy of the CFT which
are generally valid, and which at the horizon coincide with the FRW equations.
These results shed new light on recently proposed entropy bounds in the context
of cosmology.
