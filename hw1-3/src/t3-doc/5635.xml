Abelian Projection of Massive SU(2) Gluodynamics --Towards Color
  Confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  Towards describing color confinement, we derive an effective Abelian gauge
theory (EAGT) of a modified SU(2) gluodynamics. The modification is made by
explicitly introducing mass terms of the off-diagonal gluon fields into pure
SU(2) gluodynamics, or SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, in order that Abelian dominance
at a long-distance scale is realized in SU(2) QCD. In deriving the EAGT, the
off-diagonal gluon fields involving longitudinal modes are treated as fields
that produce quantum effects on the diagonal gluon field and other fields
relevant at a long-distance scale. Unlike earlier papers, a necessary gauge
fixing is carried out without spoiling the global SU(2) gauge symmetry. We show
that the EAGT allows a composite of the Yukawa and the linear potentials which
also occurs in an extended dual Abelian Higgs model. This composite potential
is understood to be a static potential between color-electric charges, whose
origin may be assigned to the gluon fields. In addition, we point out that the
EAGT involves the Skyrme-Faddeev model.
