Systematics of Quarter BPS operators in N=4 SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  A systematic construction is presented of 1/4 BPS operators in N=4
superconformal Yang-Mills theory, using either analytic superspace methods or
components. In the construction, the operators of the classical theory
annihilated by 4 out of 16 supercharges are arranged into two types. The first
type consists of those operators that contain 1/4 BPS operators in the full
quantum theory. The second type consists of descendants of operators in long
unprotected multiplets which develop anomalous dimensions in the quantum
theory. The 1/4 BPS operators of the quantum theory are defined to be
orthogonal to all the descendant operators with the same classical quantum
numbers. It is shown, to order $g^2$, that these 1/4 BPS operators have
protected dimensions.
