<title>
Large N Expansion From Fuzzy AdS_2
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the quantum analogue of primary fields and their descendants on
fuzzy AdS_2, proposed in hep-th/0004072. Three-point vertices are calculated
and shown to exhibit the conventional 1/N expansion as well as nonperturtive
effects in large N, thus providing a strong consistency check of the fuzzy
AdS_2 model. A few new physical motivations for this model are also presented.
