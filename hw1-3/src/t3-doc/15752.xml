<title>
Seiberg-Witten theory for a non-trivial compactification from five to
  four dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The prepotential and spectral curve are described for a smooth interpolation
between an enlarged N=4 SUSY and ordinary N=2 SUSY Yang-Mills theory in four
dimensions, obtained by compactification from five dimensions with non-trivial
(periodic and antiperiodic) boundary conditions. This system provides a new
solution to the generalized WDVV equations. We show that this exhausts all
possible solutions of a given functional form.
