Aspects of Confinement and Screening in M theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Confinement and Screening are investigated in SUSY gauge theories, realized
by an M5 brane configuration, extending an approach applied previously to N=1
SYM theory, to other models. The electric flux tubes are identified as M2
branes ending on the M5 branes and the conserved charge they carry is
identified as a topological property. The group of charges carried by the flux
tubes is calculated and the results agree in all cases considered with the
field theoretical expectations. In particular, whenever the dynamical matter is
expected to screen the confining force, this is reproduced correctly in the M
theory realization.
