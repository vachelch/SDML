Curved Domain Walls of Five Dimensional Gauged Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study curved domain wall solutions for gauged supergravity theories
obtained by gauging some of the isometries of the manifold spanned by the
scalars of vector and hypermultiplets. We first consider the case obtained by
compactifying M-theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold in the presence of G-fluxes.
It is found that supersymmetry allows for the construction of domain wall
configurations with curved worldvolume and a cosmological constant. However it
turns out that the equations of motion, if one insists on the supersymmetric
ansatz for the scalars and warp factor, rule out solutions with a cosmological
constant and allows only for Ricci-flat worldvolumes. Moreover, in the absence
of flux, there are non-supersymmetric solutions with worldvolumes given by
Einstein manifolds. We also generalize our results to all five dimensional
gauged supergravity.
