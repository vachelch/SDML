Aspects of classical and quantum motion on a flux cone
</title>

<abstract>
  Motion of a non-relativistic particle on a cone with a magnetic flux running
through the cone axis (a ``flux cone'') is studied. It is expressed as the
motion of a particle moving on the Euclidean plane under the action of a
velocity-dependent force. Probability fluid (``quantum flow'') associated with
a particular stationary state is studied close to the singularity,
demonstrating non trivial Aharonov-Bohm effects. For example, it is shown that
near the singularity quantum flow departs from classical flow. In the context
of the hydrodynamical approach to quantum mechanics, quantum potential due to
the conical singularity is determined and the way it affects quantum flow is
analysed. It is shown that the winding number of classical orbits plays a role
in the description of the quantum flow. Connectivity of the configuration space
is also discussed.
