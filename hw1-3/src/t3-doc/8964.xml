<title>
Simplifications in Lagrangian BV quantization exemplified by the
  anomalies of chiral $W_3$ gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The Batalin--Vilkovisky (BV) formalism is a useful framework to study gauge
theories. We summarize a simple procedure to find a a gauge--fixed action in
this language and a way to obtain one--loop anomalies. Calculations involving
the antifields can be greatly simplified by using a theorem on the antibracket
cohomology. The latter is based on properties of a `Koszul--Tate differential',
namely its acyclicity and nilpotency. We present a new proof for this
acyclicity, respecting locality and covariance of the theory. This theorem then
implies that consistent higher ghost terms in various expressions exist, and it
avoids tedious calculations.
  This is illustrated in chiral $W_3$ gravity.  We compute the one--loop
anomaly without terms of negative ghost number. Then the mentioned theorem and
the consistency condition imply that the full anomaly is determined up to local
counterterms. Finally we show how to implement background charges into the BV
language in order to cancel the anomaly with the appropriate
counterterms. Again we use the theorem to simplify the calculations, which
agree with previous results.
