Composite Operators and Topological Contributions in Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In $D$-dimensional gauge theory with a kinetic term based on the p-form
tensor gauge field, we introduce a gauge invariant operator associated with the
composite formed from a electric $(p-1)$-brane and a magnetic $(q-1)$-brane in
$D=p+q+1$ spacetime dimensions. By evaluating the partition function for this
operator, we show that the expectation value of this operator gives rise to the
topological contributions identical to those in gauge theory with a topological
Chern-Simons BF term.
