D-Brane Recoil and Logarithmic Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the pair of logarithmic operators associated with the recoil of
a $D$-brane. This construction establishes a connection between a translation
in time and a world-sheet rescaling. The problem of measuring the centre of
mass coordinate of the $D$-brane is considered and the relation between the
string uncertainty principle and the logarithmic operators is discussed.
