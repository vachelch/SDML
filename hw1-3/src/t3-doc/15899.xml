Cardy-Verlinde Formula and asymptotically flat rotating Charged black
  holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The Cardy-Verlinde formula is generalized to the asymptotically flat rotating
charged black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell theory and low-energy effective
field theory describing string by using some typical spacetimes, such as the
Kerr-Newman, Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion, Kaluza-Klein, and Sen black holes.
For the Kerr-Newman black hole, the definition of the Casimir energy takes the
same form as that of the Kerr-Newman-AdS$_4$ and Kerr-Newman-dS$_4$ black
holes, while the Cardy-Verlinde formula possesses different from since the
Casimir energy does not appear in the extensive energy. The
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion, Kaluza-Klein, and Sen black holes have special
property: The definition of the Casimir energy for these black holes is similar
to that of the Kerr-Newman black hole, but the Cardy-Verlinde formula takes the
same form as that of the Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we also study the
entropy bounds for the systems in which the matters surrounds these black
holes. We find that the bound for the case of the Kerr-Newman black hole is
related to its charge, and the bound for the cases of the EMDA, Kaluza-Klein,
and Sen black holes can be expressed as a unified form. A surprising result is
that the entropy bounds for the Kaluza-Klein and Sen black holes are tighter
than the Bekenstein one.
