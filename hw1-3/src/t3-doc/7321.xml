<title>
Universality of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate one-flavor QCD with an additional chiral scalar field. For a
large domain in the space of coupling constants, this model belongs to the same
universality class as QCD, and the effects of the scalar become unobservable.
This is connected to a ``bound-state fixed point'' of the renormalization flow
for which all memory of the microscopic scalar interactions is lost. The QCD
domain includes a microscopic scalar potential with minima at nonzero field. On
the other hand, for a scalar mass term m^2 below a critical value m_c^2, the
universality class is characterized by perturbative spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking which renders the quarks massive. Our renormalization group analysis
shows how this universality class is continuously connected with the QCD
universality class.
