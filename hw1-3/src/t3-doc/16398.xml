Planes, branes and automorphisms: II. Branes in motion
</title>

<abstract>
  We complete the classification of supersymmetric configurations of two
M5-branes, started by Ohta and Townsend. The novel configurations not
considered before are those in which the two branes are moving relative to one
another. These configurations are obtained by starting with two coincident
branes and Lorentz-transforming one of them while preserving some
supersymmetry. We completely classify the supersymmetric configurations
involving two M5-branes, and interpret them group-theoretically. We also
present some partial results on supersymmetric configurations involving an
arbitrary number of M5-branes. We show that these configurations correspond to
Cayley planes in eight-dimensions which are null-rotated relative to each other
in the remaining (2+1) dimensions. The generic configuration preserves 1/32 of
the supersymmetry, but other fractions (up to 1/4) are possible by restricting
the planes to certain subsets of the Cayley grassmannian. We discuss some
examples with fractions 1/32, 1/16, 3/32, 1/8, 1/4 involving an arbitrary
number of branes, as well as their associated geometries.
