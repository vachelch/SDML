<title>
Low-energy graceful exit in anisotropic string cosmology backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the possibility of a smooth transition from the pre- to the
post-big bang regime, in the context of the lowest-order string effective
action (without higher-derivative corrections), taking into account with a
phenomenological model of source the repulsive gravitational effects due to the
back-reaction of the quantum fluctuations outside the horizon. We determine a
set of necessary conditions for a successful and realistic transition, and we
find that such conditions can be satisfied (by an appropriate model of source),
provided the background is higher-dimensional and anisotropic.
