<title>
Solution of Schwinger-Dyson Equations for ${\cal PT}$-Symmetric Quantum
  Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In recent papers it has been observed that non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, such
as those describing $ig\phi^3$ and $-g\phi^4$ field theories, still possess
real positive spectra so long as the weaker condition of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry
holds. This allows for the possibility of new kinds of quantum field theories
that have strange and quite unexpected properties. In this paper a technique
based on truncating the Schwinger-Dyson equations is presented for
renormalizing and solving such field theories. Using this technique it is
argued that a $-g\phi^4$ scalar quantum field theory in four-dimensional
space-time is renormalizable, is asymptotically free, has a nonzero value of
$<0|\phi|0>$, and has a positive definite spectrum. Such a theory might be
useful in describing the Higgs boson.
