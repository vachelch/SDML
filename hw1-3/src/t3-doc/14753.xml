Faddeev-Hopf knots: Dynamics of linked un-knots
</title>

<abstract>
  We have studied numerically Faddeev-Hopf knots, which are defined as those
unit-vector fields in $R^3$ that have a nontrivial Hopf charge and minimize
Faddeev's Lagrangian. A given initial configuration was allowed to relax into a
(local) minimum using the first order dissipative dynamics corresponding to the
steepest descent method. A linked combination of two un-knots was seen to relax
into different minimum energy configurations depending on their charges and
their relative handedness and direction. In order to visualize the results we
plot certain gauge-invariant iso-surfaces.
