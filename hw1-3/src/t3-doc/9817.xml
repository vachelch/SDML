<title>
The Loop Group of E_8 and K-Theory from 11d
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the conjecture that an 11d E_8 bundle, appearing in the
calculation of phases in the M-Theory partition function, plays a physical role
in M-Theory, focusing on consequences for the classification of string theory
solitons. This leads for example to a classification of IIA solitons in terms
of that of LE_8 bundles in 10d. Since K(Z,2) approximates LE_8 up to \pi_{14},
this reproduces the K-Theoretic classification of IIA D-branes while treating
NSNS and RR solitons more symmetrically and providing a natural interpretation
of G_0 as the central extension of LE_8.
