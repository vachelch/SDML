N=4 Topological Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to make a topological string theory starting from an $N=4$
superconformal theory. The critical dimension for this theory is $\hat c= 2$
($c=6$). It is shown that superstrings (in both the RNS and GS formulations)
and critical $N=2$ strings are special cases of this topological theory.
Applications for this new topological theory include: 1) Proving the vanishing
to all orders of all scattering amplitudes for the self-dual $N=2$ string with
flat background, with the exception of the three-point function and the
closed-string partition function; 2) Showing that the topological partition
function of the $N=2$ string on the $K3$ background may be interpreted as
computing the superpotential in harmonic superspace generated upon
compactification of type II superstrings from 10 to 6 dimensions; and 3)
Providing a new prescription for calculating superstring amplitudes which
appears to be free of total-derivative ambiguities.
