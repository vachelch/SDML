<title>
On the problem of unboundedness from below of the spinor QED Hamiltonian
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Hamiltonian $ h= H_{QED}+H_2$, where $H_{QED}$ is the spinor
QED Hamiltonian and $H_2$ is the positive transversal photon mass term, is
unbounded from below if the electromagnetic coupling constant $e^2$ is small
enough, $e^2<e^2_0 $, and the transversal photon squared mass parameter $M^2$
is not too large: $0\leq M^2<e^2l^2c$, here, $l$ is the cut-off parameter, and
$c$ and $e^2_0$, positive constants which do not depend on any parameters.
