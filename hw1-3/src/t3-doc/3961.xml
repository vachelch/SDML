Time-dependent perturbations in two-dimensional String Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss time-dependent perturbations (induced by matter fields) of a
black-hole background in tree-level two-dimensional string theory. We analyse
the linearized case and show the possibility of having black-hole solutions
with time-dependent horizons. The latter exist only in the presence of
time-dependent `tachyon' matter fields, which constitute the only propagating
degrees of freedom in two-dimensional string theory. For real tachyon field
configurations it is not possible to obtain solutions with horizons shrinking
to a point. On the other hand, such a possibility seems to be realized in the
case of string black-hole models formulated on higher world-sheet genera. We
connect this latter result with black hole evaporation/decay at a quantum
level.}
