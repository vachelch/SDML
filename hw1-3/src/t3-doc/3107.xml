Generalised twisted partition functions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the set of partition functions that result from the insertion of
twist operators compatible with conformal invariance in a given 2D Conformal
Field Theory (CFT). A consistency equation, which gives a classification of
twists, is written and solved in particular cases. This generalises old results
on twisted torus boundary conditions, gives a physical interpretation of
Ocneanu's algebraic construction, and might offer a new route to the study of
properties of CFT.
