Stacking a 4D geometry into an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet bulk
</title>

<abstract>
  In Einstein gravity there is a simple procedure to build D-dimensional
spacetimes starting from (D-1)-dimensional ones, by stacking any
(D-1)-dimensional Ricci-flat metric into the extra-dimension. We analyze this
procedure in the context of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and find that it can
only be applied to metrics with a constant Krestschmann scalar. For instance,
we show that solutions of the black-string type are not allowed in this
framework.
