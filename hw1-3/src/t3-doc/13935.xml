Area-preserving Structure and Anomalies in 1+1-dimensional Quantum
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the gauge-independent Hamiltonian formulation and the
anomalous Ward identities of a matter-induced 1+1-dimensional gravity theory
invariant under Weyl transformations and area-preserving diffeomorphisms, and
compare the results to the ones for the conventional diffeomorphism-invariant
theory. We find that, in spite of several technical differences encountered in
the analysis, the two theories are essentially equivalent.
