<title>
Supersymmetric Berry Index
</title>

<abstract>
  We revise the sequences of SUSY for a cyclic adiabatic evolution governed by
the supersymmetric quantum mechanical Hamiltonian. The condition
(supersymmetric adiabatic evolution) under which the supersymmetric reductions
of Berry (nondegenerated case) or Wilczek-Zee (degenerated case) phases of
superpartners are taking place is pointed out. The analogue of Witten index
(supersymmetric Berry index) is determined. As the examples of suggested
concept of supersymmetric adiabatic evolution the Holomorphic quantum mechanics
on complex plane and Meromorphic quantum mechanics on Riemann surface are
considered. The supersymmetric Berry indexes for the models are calculated.
