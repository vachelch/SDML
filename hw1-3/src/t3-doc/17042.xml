<title>
Multi-Leg One-Loop Gravity Amplitudes from Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  By exploiting relations between gravity and gauge theories, we present two
infinite sequences of one-loop n-graviton scattering amplitudes: the `maximally
helicity-violating' amplitudes in N=8 supergravity, and the `all-plus' helicity
amplitudes in gravity with any minimally coupled massless matter content. The
all-plus amplitudes correspond to self-dual field configurations and vanish in
supersymmetric theories. We make use of the tree-level Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT)
relations between open and closed string theory amplitudes, which in the
low-energy limit imply relations between gravity and gauge theory tree
amplitudes. For n < 7, we determine the all-plus amplitudes explicitly from
their unitarity cuts. The KLT relations, applied to the cuts, allow us to
extend to gravity a previously found `dimension-shifting' relation between (the
cuts of) the all-plus amplitudes in gauge theory and the maximally
helicity-violating amplitudes in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. The gravitational
version of the relation lets us determine the n < 7 N=8 supergravity amplitudes
from the all-plus gravity amplitudes. We infer the two series of amplitudes for
all n from their soft and collinear properties, which can also be derived from
gauge theory using the KLT relations.
