Linearization of W algebras and W superalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  In a recent paper, the authors have shown that the secondary reduction of
W-algebras provides a natural framework for the linearization of W-algebras. In
particular, it allows in a very simple way the calculation of the linear
algebra $W(G,H)_{\geq0}$ associated to a wide class of W(G,H) algebras, as well
as the expression of the W generators of W(G,H) in terms of the generators of
$W(G,H)_{\geq0}$. In this paper, we present the extension of the above
technique to W-superalgebras, i.e. W-algebras containing fermions and bosons of
arbitrary (positive) spins. To be self-contained the paper recall the
linearization of W-algebras. We include also examples such as the linearization
of W_n algebras; W(sl(3|1),sl(3)) and W(osp(1|4),sp(4)) = WB_2 superalgebras.
