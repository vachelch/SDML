Supersymmetries and Hopf-duality in the Penrose Limit of AdS_3 times S^3
  times T^4
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate various aspects of the plane wave geometries obtained from
D1/D5-brane system. We study the effect of Hopf-duality on the supersymmetries
preserved by the Penrose limit of $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ geometry. In
type-IIB case, we first show that the Penrose limit makes the size of the
`would-be' internal torus comparable to that of the other directions. Based on
this observation, we consider, in taking the Penrose limit, the generalization
of the null geodesic to incorporate the tilted direction between the equator of
$S^3$ and one of the torus directions. For generic values of the tilting angle,
supersymmetries are not preserved. When the limit is taken along the torus
direction, 16 supersymmetries are preserved. For the ordinary Penrose limit, 16
generic and 8 `supernumerary' supersymmetries are observed. In the Penrose
limit of Hopf-dualized type-IIA geometry, only 4 supersymmetries are preserved.
We classify all the Killing spinors according to their periodic properties
along some relevant coordinates.
