<title>
Antisymmetrised 2p-forms generalising curvature 2-forms and a
  corresponding p-hierarchy of Schwarzschild type metrics in dimensions d>2p+1
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting with the curvature 2-form a recursive construction of totally
antisymmetrised 2p-forms is introduced, to which we refer as p-Riemann tensors.
Contraction of indices permits a corresponding generalisation of the Ricci
tensor. Static, spherically symmetric ``$p$-Ricci flat'' Schwarzschild like
metrics are constructed in this context for d>2p+1, d being the spacetime
dimension. The existence of de Sitter type solutions is pointed out. Our
2p-forms vanish for $d<2p$ and the limiting cases d=2p and d=2p+1 exhibit
special features which are discussed briefly. It is shown that for d=4p our
class of solutions correspond to double-selfdual Riemann 2p-form (or p-Riemann
tensor). Topological aspects of such generalised gravitational instantons and
those of associated (through spin connections) generalised Yang-Mills
instantons are briefly mentioned. The possibility of a study of surface
deformations at the horizons of our class of ``p-black holes'' leading to
Virasoro algebras with a p-dependent hierarchy of central charges is commented
on. Remarks in conclusion indicate directions for further study and situate our
formalism in a broader context.
