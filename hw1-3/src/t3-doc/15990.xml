Neveu-Schwarz Five-Branes at Orbifold Singularities and Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Type IIB Neveu-Schwarz five-branes transverse to C^2/Z_n
orbifolds and conjecture that string theory on the near horizon geometry is
dual to the decoupled theory on the branes. We analyze the conformal field
theory describing the near horizon region and the world volume non-critical
string theory. The modular invariance consistency condition of string theory is
exactly reproduced as the gauge anomaly cancellation condition in the little
string theories. We comment on aspects of the holographic nature of this
duality.
