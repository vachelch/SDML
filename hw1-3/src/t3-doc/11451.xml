Toda Lattice Hierarchy and the Topological Description of the c=1 String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The Toda lattice hierarchy is discussed in connection with the topological
description of the $c=1$ string theory compactified at the self-dual radius. It
is shown that when special constraints are imposed on the Toda hierarchy, it
reproduces known results of the $c=1$ string theory, in particular the
$W_{1+\infty}$ relations among tachyon correlation functions. These constraints
are the analogues of string equations in the topological minimal theories. We
also point out that at $c=1$ the Landau-Ginzburg superpotential becomes simply
a $U(1)$ current operator.
