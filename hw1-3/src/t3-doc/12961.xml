<title>
Canonical quantization of a massive particle on $AdS_3$
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical theory for a massive free particle moving on the group manifold
$AdS_3 \cong SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ is analysed in detail. In particular a
symplectic structure and two different sets of canonical coordinates are
explicitly found, corresponding to the Cartan and Iwasawa decomposition of the
group. Canonical quantization is performed in two different ways; either by
imposing the future-directed constraint before or after quantization. It is
found that this leads to different quantum theories. The Hilbert space of
either theory decomposes into the sum of certain irreducible representations of
$sl(2,\mathbb{R}) \oplus sl(2,\mathbb{R})$; however, depending on how the
constraint is imposed we get different representations. Quantization of the
mass occurs, although a continuum exists in the unconstrained theory
corresponding to particles that can reverse their direction in time. A
representation on function space is worked out in detail, and from this the
wavefunctions of $\widetilde{AdS_3}$ and the $BTZ$ black hole are deduced. A
quantization in terms of the ``chiral'' variables of the theory is also carried
out giving the same results. Comparisons are made between QFT in $AdS_3$ and
the quantum mechanics derived.
