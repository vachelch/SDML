Fixed scalar greybody factors in five and four dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform the classical gravity calculations of the fixed scalar absorption
cross-sections by D=5 black holes with three charges and by D=4 black holes
with four charges. We obtain analytic results for the cases where the energy
and the left and right moving temperatures are sufficiently low but have
arbitrary ratios. In D=5 the greybody factor is in perfect agreement with the
recent calculation performed in the context of the effective string model for
black holes. In D=4 the formula for the greybody factor in terms of the
energy and the temperatures differs from that in D=5 only by the overall
normalization. This suggests that the fixed scalar coupling to the effective
string in D=4 is identical to that in D=5.
