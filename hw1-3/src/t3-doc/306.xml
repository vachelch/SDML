<title>
T-duality for boundary-non-critical point-particle and string quantum
  mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  It is observed that some structures recently uncovered in the study of
Calogero-Sutherland models and anyons are close analogs of well-known
structures of boundary conformal field theory. These examples of ``boundary
conformal quantum mechanics'', in spite of their apparent simplicity, have a
rather reach structure, including some sort of T-duality, and could provide
useful frameworks for testing general properties of boundary conformal
theories. Of particular interest are the duality properties of anyons and
Calogero-Sutherland particles in presence of boundary-violations of conformal
invariance; these are here briefly analyzed leading to the conjecture of a
general interconnection between (deformed) boundary conformal quantum
mechanics, T-type duality, and (``exchange'' or ``exclusion'') exotic
statistics. These results on the point-particle quantum-mechanics side are
compared with recent results on the action of T-duality on open strings that
satisfy conformal-invariance-violating boundary conditions. Moreover, it is
observed that some of the special properties of anyon and Calogero-Sutherland
quantum mechanics are also enjoyed by the M(atrix) quantum mechanics which has
recently attracted considerable attention.
