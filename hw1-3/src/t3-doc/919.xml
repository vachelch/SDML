Schwarzschild Black Holes from Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Matrix theory compactified on T^3 and show that it correctly
describes the properties of Schwarzschild black holes in 7+1 dimensions,
including the energy-entropy relation, the Hawking temperature and the physical
size, up to numerical factors of order unity. The most economical description
involves setting the cut-off N in the discretized light-cone quantization to be
of order the black hole entropy. A crucial ingredient necessary for our work is
the recently proposed equation of state for 3+1 dimensional SYM theory with 16
supercharges. We give detailed arguments for the range of validity of this
equation following the methods of Horowitz and Polchinski.
