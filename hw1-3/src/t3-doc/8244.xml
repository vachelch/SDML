On the Spectrum of QCD(1+1) with SU(N_c) Currents
</title>

<abstract>
  Extending previous work, we calculate in this note the fermionic spectrum of
two-dimensional QCD (QCD_2) in the formulation with SU(N_c) currents. Together
with the results in the bosonic sector this allows to address the as yet
unresolved task of finding the single-particle states of this theory as a
function of the ratio of the numbers of flavors and colors, \lambda=N_f/N_c,
anew. We construct the Hamiltonian matrix in DLCQ formulation as an algebraic
function of the harmonic resolution K and the continuous parameter \lambda.
Amongst the more surprising findings in the fermionic sector chiefly considered
here is that the fermion momentum is a function of \lambda. This dependence is
necessary in order to reproduce the well-known 't Hooft and large N_f spectra.
Remarkably, those spectra have the same single-particle content as the ones in
the bosonic sectors. The twist here is the dramatically different sizes of the
Fock bases in the two sectors, which makes it possible to interpret in
principle all states of the discrete approach. The hope is that some of this
insight carries over into the continuum. We also present some new findings
concerning the single-particle spectrum of the adjoint theory.
