Supersymmetry of the extreme rotating toroidal black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the supersymmetry of the charged rotating toroidal black hole
solutions found by Lemos and Zanchin, and show that the only configurations
that are supersymmetric are: (i) the non-rotating electrically charged naked
singularities already studied by Caldarelli and Klemm, and (ii) an extreme
rotating toroidal black hole with zero magnetic and electric charges. For this
latter case, the extreme uncharged black hole, we calculate the Killing spinors
and show that the configuration preserves the same supersymmetries as the
background spacetime.
