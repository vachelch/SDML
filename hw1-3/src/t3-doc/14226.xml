<title>
Graviton localization and Newton law for a dS_4 brane in 5D bulk
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an dS_4 brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk with a
positive, vanishing or negative bulk cosmological constant and derive the
localized graviton spectrum that consists of a normalizable zero-mode separated
by a gap from a continuum of massive states. We estimate the massive sector
contribution to the static potential at short distances and find that only in
the case of a negative bulk cosmological constant there is a range, determined
by the effective four-dimensional and the bulk cosmological constants, where
the conventional Newton law is valid.
