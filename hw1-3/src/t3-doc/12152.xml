Brane Dynamics in Background Fluxes and Non-commutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  Branes in non-trivial backgrounds are expected to exhibit interesting
dynamical properties. We use the boundary conformal field theory approach to
study branes in a curved background with non-vanishing Neveu-Schwarz 3-form
field strength. For branes on an $S^3$, the low-energy effective action is
computed to leading order in the string tension. It turns out to be a field
theory on a non-commutative `fuzzy 2-sphere' which consists of a Yang-Mills and
a Chern-Simons term. We find a certain set of classical solutions that have no
analogue for flat branes in Euclidean space. These solutions show, in
particular, how a spherical brane can arise as bound state from a stack of
D0-branes.
