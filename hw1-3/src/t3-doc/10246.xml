Marinari-Parisi and Supersymmetric Collective Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A field theoretic formulation of the Marinari-Parisi supersymmetric matrix
model is established and shown to be equivalent to a recently proposed
supersymmetrization of the bosonic collective string field theory. It also
corresponds to a continuum description of super-Calogero models. The
perturbation theory of the model is developed and, in this approach, an
infinite sequence of vertices is generated. A class of potentials is identified
for which the spectrum is that of a massless boson and Majorana fermion. For
the harmonic oscillator case, the cubic vertices are obtained in an oscillator
basis. For a rather general class of potentials it is argued that one cannot
generate from Marinari-Parisi models a continuum limit similar to that of the
d=1 bosonic string.
