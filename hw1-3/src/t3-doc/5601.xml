An Application of the Schwarzian Derivative
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we present an application of the Schwarzian derivative. By
exploiting some properties of the Schwarzian derivative, we solve the equation
appearing in the gravity-dilaton-antisymmetric tensor system. We also mention
that this method can also be used to solve some other equations.
