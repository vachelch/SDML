Dirac-like Monopoles in Three Dimensions and Their Possible Influences
  on the Dynamics of Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  Dirac-like monopoles are studied in three-dimensional Abelian Maxwell and
Maxwell-Chern-Simons models. Their scalar nature is highlighted and discussed
through a dimensional reduction of four-dimensional electrodynamics with
electric and magnetic sources. Some general properties and similarities of them
when are considered in Minkowski or Euclidian space are mentioned. However, by
virtue of the structure of the space-time in which they are considered a number
of differences among them take place. Furthermore, we pay attention to some
consequences of these objects when acting upon usual particles. Among other
subjects, special attention is given to the study of a Lorentz-violating
non-minimal coupling between neutral fermions and the field generated by a
monopole alone. In addition, an analogue of the Aharonov-Casher effect is
discussed in this framework.
