<title>
A tentative theory of large distance physics
</title>

<abstract>
  A theoretical mechanism is devised to determine the large distance physics of
spacetime. It is a two dimensional nonlinear model, the lambda model, set to
govern the string worldsurface to remedy the failure of string theory. The
lambda model is formulated to cancel the infrared divergent effects of handles
at short distance on the worldsurface. The target manifold is the manifold of
background spacetimes. The coupling strength is the spacetime coupling
constant. The lambda model operates at 2d distance $\Lambda^{-1}$, very much
shorter than the 2d distance $\mu^{-1}$ where the worldsurface is seen. A large
characteristic spacetime distance $L$ is given by $L^2=\ln(\Lambda/\mu)$.
Spacetime fields of wave number up to 1/L are the local coordinates for the
manifold of spacetimes. The distribution of fluctuations at 2d distances
shorter than $\Lambda^{-1}$ gives the {\it a priori} measure on the target
manifold, the manifold of spacetimes. If this measure concentrates at a
macroscopic spacetime, then, nearby, it is a measure on the spacetime fields.
The lambda model thereby constructs a spacetime quantum field theory, cutoff at
ultraviolet distance $L$, describing physics at distances larger than $L$. The
lambda model also constructs an effective string theory with infrared cutoff
$L$, describing physics at distances smaller than $L$. The lambda model evolves
outward from zero 2d distance, $\Lambda^{-1} = 0$, building spacetime physics
starting from $L=\infty$ and proceeding downward in $L$. $L$ can be taken
smaller than any distance practical for experiments, so the lambda model, if
right, gives all actually observable physics. The harmonic surfaces in the
manifold of spacetimes are expected to have novel nonperturbative effects at
large distances.
