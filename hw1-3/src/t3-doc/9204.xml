A Problem with Non-Abelian Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate duality transformations in a class of backgrounds with
non-Abelian isometries, i.e. Bianchi-type (homogeneous) cosmologies in
arbitrary dimensions. Simple duality transformations for the metric and the
antisymmetric tensor field, generalizing those known from the Abelian isometry
(Bianchi I) case, are obtained using either a Lagrangian or a Hamiltonian
approach. Applying these prescriptions to a specific conformally invariant
$\s$-model, we show that no dilaton transformation leads to a new conformal
background. Some possible ways out of the problem are suggested.
