Polymer Statistics and Fermionic Vector Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a variation of $O(N)$-symmetric vector models in which the vector
components are Grassmann numbers. We show that these theories generate the same
sort of random polymer models as the $O(N)$ vector models and that they lie in
the same universality class in the large-$N$ limit. We explicitly construct the
double-scaling limit of the theory and show that the genus expansion is an
alternating Borel summable series that otherwise coincides with the topological
expansion of the bosonic models. We also show how the fermionic nature of these
models leads to an explicit solution even at finite-$N$ for the generating
functions of the number of random polymer configurations.
