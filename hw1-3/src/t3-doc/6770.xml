A Review of Symmetry Algebras of Quantum Matrix Models in the Large-N
  Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a review article in which we will introduce, in a unifying fashion
and with more intermediate steps in some difficult calculations, two
infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of quantum matrix models, one for the open
string sector and one for the closed string sector. Physical observables of
quantum matrix models in the large-N limit can be expressed as elements of
these Lie algebras. We will see that both algebras arise as quotient algebras
of a larger Lie algebra. We will also discuss some properties of these Lie
algebras not published elsewhere yet, and briefly review their relationship
with well-known algebras like the Cuntz algebra, the Witt algebra and the
Virasoro algebra. We will also review how Yang--Mills theory, various low
energy effective models of string theory, quantum gravity, string-bit models,
and quantum spin chain models can be formulated as quantum matrix models.
Studying these algebras thus help us understand the common symmetry of these
physical systems.
