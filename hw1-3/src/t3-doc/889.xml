The Decay of Unstable Noncommutative Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the classical decay of unstable scalar solitons in noncommutative
field theory in 2+1 dimensions. This can, but does not have to, be viewed as a
toy model for the decay of D-branes in string theory. In the infinite \theta
limit, in which the gradient term is absent, there are no propagating modes and
the soliton does not decay at all. If \theta is large, but finite, the
rotationally symmetric decay channel can be described as a highly excited
nonlinear oscillator weakly coupled to a continuum of linear modes. This system
is closely akin to those studied in the context of discrete breathers. We here
diagonalize the linear problem and compute the decay rate to first order using
a version of Fermi's Golden Rule, leaving a more rigorous treatment for future
work.
