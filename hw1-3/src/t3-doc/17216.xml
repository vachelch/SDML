Three Family Type IIB Orientifold String Vacua with Non-Abelian Wilson
  Lines
</title>

<abstract>
  We address the implementation of non-Abelian Wilson lines in D=4 N=1 Type IIB
orientifold constructions. We present an explicit three-family example with the
gauge group (U(4)xU(2)xSU(2)xSU(2))^2x(U(6)xSp(4))^2 and give the particle
spectrum and the trilinear superpotential. Emphasizing the new subtleties
associated with the introduction of non-Abelian Wilson lines, we show that the
Abelian gauge anomalies are cancelled by the Green-Schwarz-type mechanism, and
calculate the Fayet-Iliopoulos terms and gauge coupling corrections. The
analysis thus sets a stage for further investigations of the phenomenological
implications of this model.
