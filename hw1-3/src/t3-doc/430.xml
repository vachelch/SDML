<title>
Local systems over complements of hyperplanes and the Kac-Kazhdan
  conditions for singular vectors.
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we strenghten a theorem by Esnault-Schechtman-Viehweg which
states that one can compute the cohomology of a complement of hyperplanes
in a complex affine space with coefficients in a local system using only
logarithmic global differential forms, provided certain "Aomoto non-resonance
conditions" for monodromies are fulfilled at some "edges" (intersections of
hyperplanes). We prove that it is enough to check these conditions on a smaller
subset of edges.
   We show that for certain known one dimensional local systems over
configuration spaces of points in a projective line defined by a root system
and a finite set of affine weights (these local systems arise in the geometric
study of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov differential equations), the Aomoto resonance
conditions at non-diagonal edges coincide with Kac-Kazhdan conditions of
reducibility of Verma modules over affine Lie algebras.
