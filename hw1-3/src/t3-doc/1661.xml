<title>
Gravitational dressing of D-instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-perturbative corrections to the universal hypermultiplet moduli space
metric in the type-IIA superstring compactification on a Calabi-Yau threefold
are investigated in the presence of 4d, N=2 supergravity. These corrections
come from multiple wrapping of the BPS (Euclidean) D2-branes around certain
(BPS) Calabi-Yau 3-cycles, and they are known as the D-instantons. The exact
universal hypermultiplet metric is governed by a quaternionic potential that
satisfies the SU(\infty) Toda equation. The mechanism is proposed, which
elevates any four-dimensional hyper-K"ahler metric with a rotational isometry
to the quaternionic metric of the same dimension. A generic separable solution
to the Toda equation appears to be related to the Eguchi-Hanson metric, whereas
another solution originating from the Atiyah-Hitchin metric describes the
gravitationally dressed (mixed) D-instantons.
