Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Compactified $\lambda\phi^4$ Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the massive vector $N$-component $(\lambda\phi^{4})_{D}$ theory
in Euclidian space and, using an extended Matsubara formalism we perform a
compactification on a $d$-dimensional subspace, $d\leq D$. This allows us to
treat jointly the effect of temperature and spatial confinement in the
effective potential of the model, setting forth grounds for an analysis of
phase transitions driven by temperature and spatial boundary. For $d=2$, which
corresponds to the heated system confined between two parallel planes
(separation $L$), we obtain, in the large $N$ limit at one-loop order, formulas
for temperature- and boundary-dependent mass and coupling constant. The
equation for the critical curve in the $\beta \times L$ plane is also derived.
