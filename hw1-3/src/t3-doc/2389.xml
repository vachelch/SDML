<title>
Peak and end point of the relic graviton background in string cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  Using general arguments we determine the allowed region for the end point
frequency and the peak energy density of the stochastic background of gravity
waves expected in string cosmology. We provide an accurate estimate of the
minimal experimental sensitivity required to detect a signal in the Hz to GHz
range.
