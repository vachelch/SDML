3D heterotic string theory: new approach and extremal solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a new formalism for the bosonic sector of low-energy heterotic
string theory toroidally compactified to three dimensions. This formalism is
based on the use of some single non-quadratic real matrix potential which
transforms linearly under the action of subgroup of the three-dimensional
charging symmetries. We formulate a new charging symmetry invariant approach
for the symmetry generation and straightforward construction of asymptotically
flat solutions. Finally, using the developed approach and the established
formal analogy between the heterotic and Einstein-Maxwell theories, we
construct a general class of the heterotic string theory extremal solutions of
the Israel-Wilson-Perjes type. This class is asymptotically flat and charging
symmetry complete; it includes the extremal solutions constructed before and
possesses the non-trivial bosonic string theory limit.
