Geometric Transitions and N=1 Quiver Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct N=1 supersymmetric theories on worldvolumes of D5 branes wrapped
around 2-cycles of threefolds which are A-D-E fibrations over a plane. We
propose large N duals as geometric transitions involving blowdowns of two
cycles and blowups of three-cycles. This yields exact predictions for a large
class of N=1 supersymmetric gauge systems including U(N) gauge theories with
two adjoint matter fields deformed by superpotential terms, which arise in
A-D-E fibered geometries with non-trivial monodromies.
