Virasoro Constraints and Flavor-Topology Duality in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive Virasoro constraints for the zero momentum part of the QCD-like
partition functions in the sector of topological charge $\nu$. The constraints
depend on the topological charge only through the combination $N_f +\beta\nu/2$
where the value of the Dyson index $\beta$ is determined by the reality type of
the fermions. This duality between flavor and topology is inherited by the
small-mass expansion of the partition function and {\em all} spectral sum-rules
of inverse powers of the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. For the special
case $\beta=2$ but arbitrary topological charge the Virasoro constraints are
solved uniquely by a Generalized Kontsevich Model with potential ${\cal V}(X) =
1/X$.
