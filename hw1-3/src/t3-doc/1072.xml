<title>
Five-Dimensional Gauge Theories and Local Mirror Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the dynamics of 5-dimensional gauge theory on $M_4\times S^1$ by
compactifying type II/M theory on degenerate Calabi-Yau manifolds. We use the
local mirror symmetry and shall show that the prepotential of the 5-dimensional
SU(2) gauge theory without matter is given exactly by that of the type II
string theory compactified on the local ${\bf F}_2$, i.e. Hirzebruch surface
${\bf F}_2$ lying inside a non-compact Calabi-Yau manifold. It is shown that
our result reproduces the Seiberg-Witten theory at the 4-dimensional limit
$R\to 0$ ($R$ denotes the radius of $S^1$) and also the result of the
uncompactified 5-dimensional theory at $R\to \infty$. We also discuss SU(2)
gauge theory with $1\le N_f\le 4$ matter in vector representations and show
that they are described by the geometry of the local ${\bf F}_2$ blown up at
$N_f$ points.
