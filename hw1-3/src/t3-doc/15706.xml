Spherically Collapsing Matter in AdS, Holography, and Shellons
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the collapse of a spherical shell of matter in an anti-de
Sitter space. We search for a holographic description of the collapsing shell
in the boundary theory. It turns out that in the boundary theory it is possible
to find information about the radial size of the shell. The shell deforms the
background spacetime, and the deformed background metric enters into the action
of a generic bulk field. As a consequence, the correlators of operators
coupling to the bulk field are modified. By studying the analytic structure of
the correlators, we find that in the boundary theory there are unstable
excitations ("shellons") whose masses are multiples of a scale set by the
radius of the shell. We also comment on the relation between black hole
formation in the bulk and thermalization in the boundary.
