Supergravity, Non-Conformal Field Theories and Brane-Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the supergravity dual descriptions of non-conformal super
Yang-Mills theories realized on the world-volume of Dp-branes. We use the dual
description to compute stress-energy tensor and current correlators. We apply
the results to the study of dilatonic brane-worlds described by non-conformal
field theories coupled to gravity. We find that brane-worlds based on D4 and D5
branes exhibit a localization of gauge and gravitational fields. We calculate
the corrections to the Newton and Coulomb laws in these theories.
