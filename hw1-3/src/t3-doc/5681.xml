<title>
Magnetic monopole loop for the Yang-Mills instanton
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate 't Hooft-Mandelstam monopoles in QCD in the presence of a
single classical instanton configuration. The solution to the Maximal Abelian
projection is found to be a circular monopole trajectory with radius $R$
centered on the instanton. At zero loop radius, there is a marginally stable
(or flat) direction for loop formation to $O(R^4 logR)$. We argue that loops
will form, in the semi-classical limit, due to small perturbations such as the
dipole interaction between instanton anti-instanton pairs. As the instanton gas
becomes a liquid, the percolation of the monopole loops may therefore provide a
semi-classical precursor to the confinement mechanism.
