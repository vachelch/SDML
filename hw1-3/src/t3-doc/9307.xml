<title>
Gauge and BRST Generators for Space-Time Non-commutative U(1) Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian (gauge) symmetry generators of non-local (gauge) theories are
presented. The construction is based on the d+1 dimensional space-time
formulation of d dimensional non-local theories. The procedure is applied to
U(1) space-time non-commutative gauge theory. In the Hamiltonian formalism the
Hamiltonian and the gauge generator are constructed. The nilpotent BRST charge
is also obtained. The Seiberg-Witten map between non-commutative and
commutative theories is described by a canonical transformation in the
superphase space and in the field-antifield space. The solutions of classical
master equations for non-commutative and commutative theories are related by a
canonical transformation in the antibracket sense.
