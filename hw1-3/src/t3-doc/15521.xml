W(E_10) Symmetry, M-Theory and Painleve Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The Weyl group symmetry W(E_k) is studied from the points of view of the
E-strings, Painleve equations and U-duality. We give a simple reformulation of
the elliptic Painleve equation in such a way that the hidden symmetry W(E_10)
is manifestly realized. This reformulation is based on the birational geometry
of the del Pezzo surface and closely related to Seiberg-Witten curves
describing the E-strings. The relation of the W(E_k) symmetry to the duality of
M-theory on a torus is discussed on the level of string equations of motion.
