<title>
(2,0) Tensor Multiplets and Conformal Supergravity in D=6
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the supercurrent multiplet that contains the energy-momentum
tensor of the (2,0) tensor multiplet. By coupling this multiplet of currents to
the fields of conformal supergravity, we first construct the linearized
superconformal transformations rules of the (2,0) Weyl multiplet. Next, we
construct the full non-linear transformation rules by gauging the
superconformal algebra OSp(8^*|4). We then use this result to construct the
full equations of motion of the tensor multiplet in a conformal supergravity
background. Coupling N+5 copies of the tensor multiplet to conformal
supergravity and imposing a geometrical constraint on the scalar fields which
fixes the conformal symmetry, we obtain the coupling of (2,0) Poincare
supergravity to N tensor multiplets in which the physical scalars parametrize
the coset SO(N,5)/(SO(N) x SO(5)).
