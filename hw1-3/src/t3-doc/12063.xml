The Operator Spectrum of the Six-dimensional (1,0) Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the large N operator spectrum of the (1,0) superconformal chiral
six-dimensional theory with E_8 global symmetry. This spectrum is dual to the
Kaluza-Klein spectrum of supergravity on AdS_7 X S^4/Z_2 with a ten-dimensional
E_8 theory at its singular locus. We identify those operators in short
multiplets of OSp(6,2|2), whose dimensions are exact for any N. We also discuss
more general issues concerning AdS/CFT duality on orbifold supergravity
backgrounds.
