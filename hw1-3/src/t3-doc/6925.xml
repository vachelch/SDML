BRST properties of spin fields
</title>

<abstract>
  For the closed superstring, spin fields and bi-spinor states are defined
directly in four spacetime dimensions. Explicit operator product expansions are
given, including those for the internal superconformal field theory, which are
consistent with locality and BRST invariance for the string vertices. The most
general BRST picture changing for these fields is computed. A covariant
notation for the spin decomposition of these states is developed in which
non-vanishing polarizations are selected automatically. The kinematics of the
three-gluon dual model amplitude in both the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors
in the Lorentz gauges is calculated and contrasted. Modular invariance and
enhanced gauge symmetry of four-dimensional models incorporating these states
is described.
