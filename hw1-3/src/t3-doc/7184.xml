<title>
On the Uniqueness of String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that bosonic strings may be viewed as a particular class of vacua for
N=1 superstrings, and N=1 superstrings may be viewed as a particular class of
vacua for N=2 strings. Continuing this line of string hierarchies, we are led
to search for a universal string theory which includes all the rest as a
special vacuum selection.
