<title>
Z_k String fluxes and monopole confinement in non-Abelian theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently (hep-th/0104171) we considered N=2 Super Yang-Mills with a mass
breaking term and showed the existence of BPS Z_k string solutions for
arbitrary simple gauge groups which are spontaneously broken to non-Abelian
residual gauge groups. We also calculated their string tensions exactly. In
doing so, we have considered in particular the hypermultiplet in the
representation of a diquark condensate. In the present work we shall analyze
some of the different phases of the theory and find that the magnetic fluxes of
the monopoles and Z_k strings of the theory are proportional, allowing for
monopole confinement in one of the phase transitions of the theory. Then we
will calculate the threshold length for a string to break in a new pair of
monopole-antimonopole. We will further show that some of the resulting
confining theories can obtained by adding a deformation term to N=2 or N=4
superconformal theories and, as such, may satisfy a gauge/string
correspondence.
