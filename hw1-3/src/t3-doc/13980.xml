Domain Walls Zoo in Supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Solving numerically the equations of motion for the effective lagrangian
describing supersymmetric QCD with the SU(2) gauge group, we find a menagerie
of complex domain wall solutions connecting different chirally asymmetric
vacua. Some of these solutions are BPS saturated walls; they exist when the
mass of the matter fields does not exceed some critical value m < m* <
4.67059... There are also sphaleron branches (saddle points of the ebergy
functional). In the range m* < m < m** \approx 4.83, one of these branches
becomes a local minimum (which is not a BPS saturated one). At m > m*, the
complex walls disappear altogether and only the walls connecting a chirally
asymmetric vacuum with the chirally symmetric one survive.
