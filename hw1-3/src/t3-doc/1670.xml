<title>
Dilaton-Maxwell gravity with matter near two dimensions.
</title>

<abstract>
Unlike Einstein gravity, dilaton-Maxwell gravity with matter is renormalizable
in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions and has a smooth $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ limit.By
performing a renormalization- group study of this last theory we show that the
gravitational coupling constant $G$ has a non-trivial,ultraviolet stable fixed
point (asymptotic freedom) and that the dilatonic coupling functions (including
the dilatonic potential) exhibit also a real, non-trivial fixed point. At such
point the theory represents a standard charged string-inspired model.Stability
and the gauge dependence of the fixed-point solution is discussed.It is shown
that all these properties remain valid in a dilatonic-Yang-Mills theory with
$n$ scalars and $m$ spinors, that has the UF stable fixed point $G^* =
3\epsilon (48+12N-m-2n)^{-1}$.In addition, it is seen that by increasing $N$
(number of gauge fields) the matter central charge $C=n+m/2$ ($0<C<24+6N$) can
be increased correspondingly ( in pure dilatonic gravity $0<C<24$).
