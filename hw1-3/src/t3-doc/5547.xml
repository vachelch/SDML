Zero Modes and the Atiyah-Singer Index in Noncommutative Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the bosonic and fermionic zero modes in noncommutative instanton
backgrounds based on the ADHM construction. In k instanton background in U(N)
gauge theory, we show how to explicitly construct 4Nk (2Nk) bosonic (fermionic)
zero modes in the adjoint representation and 2k (k) bosonic (fermionic) zero
modes in the fundamental representation from the ADHM construction. The number
of fermionic zero modes is also shown to be exactly equal to the Atiyah-Singer
index of the Dirac operator in the noncommutative instanton background. We
point out that (super)conformal zero modes in non-BPS instantons are affected
by the noncommutativity. The role of Lorentz symmetry breaking by the
noncommutativity is also briefly discussed to figure out the structure of U(1)
instantons.
