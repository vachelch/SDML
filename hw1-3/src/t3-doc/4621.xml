<title>
Folds, Bosonization and non-triviality of the classical limit of 2D
  string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the 1-dimensional matrix model one identifies the tachyon field in the
asymptotic region with a nonlocal transform of the density of fermions. But
there is a problem in relating the classical tachyon field with the surface
profile of the fermi fluid if a fold forms in the fermi surface. Besides the
collective field additional variables $w_j(x)$ are required to describe folds.
In the quantum theory we show that the $w_j$ are the quantum dispersions of the
collective field. These dispersions become $O(1)$ rather than $O(\hbar)$
precisely after fold formation, thus giving additional `classical' quantities
and leading to a rather nontrivial classical limit. A coherent pulse reflecting
from the potential wall turns into high energy incoherent quanta (if a fold
forms), the frequency amplification being of the order of the square root of
the number of quanta in the incident wave.
