P,T-invariant system of Chern-Simons fields: Pseudoclassical model and
  hidden symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate hidden symmetries of P,T-invariant system of topologically
massive U(1) gauge fields. For this purpose, we propose a pseudoclassical model
giving rise to this field system at the quantum level. The model contains a
parameter, which displays a quantization property at the classical and the
quantum levels and demonstrates a nontrivial relationship between continuous
and discrete symmetries. Analyzing the integrals of motion of the
pseudoclassical model, we identify U(1,1) symmetry and S(2,1) supersymmetry as
hidden symmetries of the corresponding quantum system. Representing the hidden
symmetries in a covariant form, we show that one-particle states realize an
irreducible representation of a non-standard super-extension of the
(2+1)-dimensional Poincare group labelled by the zero eigenvalue of the
superspin.
