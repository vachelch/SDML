Embedding of the Bosonic String into the $W_3$ String
</title>

<abstract>
We investigate new realisations of the $W_3$ algebra with arbitrary central
charge, making use of the fact that this algebra can be linearised by the
inclusion of a spin-1 current. We use the new realisations with $c=102$ and
$c=100$ to build non-critical and critical $W_3$ BRST operators. Both of these
can be converted by local canonical transformations into a BRST operator for
the Virasoro string with $c=28-2$, together with a Kugo-Ojima topological term.
Consequently, these new realisations provide embeddings of the Virasoro string
into non-critical and critical $W_3$ strings.
