<title>
Chiral Random Matrix Model for Critical Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a random matrix model that interpolates between the chiral random
matrix ensembles and the chiral Poisson ensemble. By mapping this model on a
non-interacting Fermi-gas we show that for energy differences less than a
critical energy $E_c$ the spectral correlations are given by chiral Random
Matrix Theory whereas for energy differences larger than $E_c$ the number
variance shows a linear dependence on the energy difference with a slope that
depends on the parameters of the model. If the parameters are scaled such that
the slope remains fixed in the thermodynamic limit, this model provides a
description of QCD Dirac spectra in the universality class of critical
statistics. In this way a good description of QCD Dirac spectra for gauge field
configurations given by a liquid of instantons is obtained.
