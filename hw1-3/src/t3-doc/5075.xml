Graviton-Scalar Interaction in the PP-Wave Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the graviton two scalar off-shell interaction vertex at tree level
in Type IIB superstring theory on the pp-wave background using the light-cone
string field theory formalism. We then show that the tree level vertex vanishes
when all particles are on-shell and conservation of p_{+} and p_{-} are
imposed. We reinforce our claim by calculating the same vertex starting from
the corresponding SUGRA action expanded around the pp-wave background in the
light-cone gauge.
