<title>
On SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory and the Maximal Abelian Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of identifying the dynamical degrees of freedom for SU(2) gauge
theories is discussed. After studying SU(N) theories, it is shown that
classical pure SU(2) gauge theory is equivalent to an abelian theory. Finally,
we prove that the Maximal Abelian Gauge correctly identifies the abelian
degrees of freedom of the SU(2) theory.
