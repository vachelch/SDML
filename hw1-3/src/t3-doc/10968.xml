Localized gravity on FRW branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the system of Schwarzschild anti de Sitter (S-AdS) bulk and FRW
brane for localization of gravity; i.e. zero mass gravitons having ground state
on the brane, and thereby recovering the Einstein gravity with high energy
correction. It has been known that gravity is not localized on AdS brane with
AdS bulk. We prove the general result that gravity is not localized for dynamic
branes whenever Lambda_4 < 0, and is localized for the curvature index k = 1
only when Lambda_4 > 0 and black hole mass M not equal 0, else it is localized
for all other FRW models. If the localization is taken as the brane world
compatibility criterion for cosmological models, then it would predict that
negative cosmological constant on the brane is not sustainable.
