Twistfield Perturbations of Vertex Operators in the Z_2-Orbifold Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply Kadanoff's theory of marginal deformations of conformal field
theories to twistfield deformations of Z_2 orbifold models in K3 moduli space.
These deformations lead away from the Z_2 orbifold sub-moduli-space and hence
help to explore conformal field theories which have not yet been understood. In
particular, we calculate the deformation of the conformal dimensions of vertex
operators for p^2<1 in second order perturbation theory.
