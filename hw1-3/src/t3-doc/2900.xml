Holographic principle in the BDL brane cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the holographic principle in the brane cosmology. Especially we
describe how to accommodate the 5D anti de Sitter Schwarzschild (AdSS$_5$)
black hole in the Binetruy-Deffayet-Langlois (BDL) approach of brane cosmology.
It is easy to make a connection between a mass $M$ of the AdSS$_5$ black hole
and a conformal field theory (CFT)-radiation dominated universe on the brane in
the moving domain wall approach. But this is not established in the BDL
approach. In this case we use two parameters $C_1, C_2$ in the Friedmann
equation. These arise from integration and are really related to the choice of
initial bulk matter. If one chooses a bulk energy density $\rho_B$ to account
for a mass $M$ of the AdSS$_5$ black hole and the static fifth dimension, a
CFT-radiation term with $\rho_{CFT} \sim M/a^{4}$ comes out from the bulk
matter without introducing a localized matter distribution on the brane. This
means that the holographic principle can be established in the BDL brane
cosmology.
