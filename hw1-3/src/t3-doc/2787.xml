D-Brane Bound States Redux
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the existence of D-brane bound states at threshold in Type II string
theories. In a number of situations, we can reduce the question of existence to
quadrature, and the study of a particular limit of the propagator for the
system of D-branes. This involves a derivation of an index theorem for a family
of non-Fredholm operators. In support of the conjectured relation between
compactified eleven-dimensional supergravity and Type IIA string theory, we
show that a bound state exists for two coincident zero-branes. This result also
provides support for the conjectured description of M-theory as a matrix model.
In addition, we provide further evidence that there are no BPS bound states for
two and three-branes twice wrapped on Calabi-Yau vanishing cycles.
