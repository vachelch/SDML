Vacuum Nodes and Anomalies in Quantum Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that nodal points of ground states of some quantum systems with
magnetic interactions can be identified in simple geometric terms. We analyse
in detail two different archetypical systems: i) a planar rotor with a
non-trivial magnetic flux $\Phi$, ii) Hall effect on a torus. In the case of
the planar rotor we show that the level repulsion generated by any reflection
invariant potential $V$ is encoded in the nodal structure of the unique vacuum
for $\theta=\pi$. In the second case we prove that the nodes of the first
Landau level for unit magnetic charge appear at the crossing of the two
non-contractible circles $\alpha_-$, $\beta_-$ with holonomies
$h_{\alpha_-}(A)= h_{\beta_-}(A)=-1$ for any reflection invariant potential
$V$. This property illustrates the geometric origin of the quantum translation
anomaly.
