Supergravity Duals of Matrix String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the holographic duals of type II and heterotic matrix string
theories described by warped AdS_3 supergravities. By explicitly solving the
linearized equations of motion around near horizon D-string geometries, we
determine the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein primaries for type I, II supergravities
on warped AdS_3 x S^7. The results match those coming from the dual
two-dimensional gauge theories living on the D-string worldvolumes. We briefly
discuss the connections with the N=(8,8), N=(8,0) orbifold superconformal field
theories to which type IIB / heterotic matrix strings flow in the infrared. In
particular, we associate the dimension (3/2, 3/2) twisted operator which brings
the matrix string theories out from the conformal point (R^8)^N / S_N with the
dilaton profile in the supergravity background.
  The familiar dictionary between masses and scaling dimensions of fields and
operators are modified by the presence of non-trivial warp factors and running
dilatons. These modifications are worked out for the general case of domain
wall / QFT correspondences between supergravities on warped AdS_{d+1} x S^q
geometries and super Yang-Mills theories with 16 supercharges.
