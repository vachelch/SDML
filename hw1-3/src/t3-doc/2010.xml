<title>
On a geometric derivation of Witten's identity for Chern-Simons theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a formal but simple calculational scheme to relate the expectation
value of Wilson loops in Chern-Simons theory to the Jones polynomial. We
consider the exponential of the generator of homotopy transformations which
produces the finite loop deformations that define the crossing change formulas
of knot polynomials. Applying this operator to the expectation value of Wilson
loops for an unspecified measure we find a set of conditions on the measure and
the regularization such that the Jones polynomial is obtained.
