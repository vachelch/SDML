<title>
Hierarchy of Dirac, Pauli and Klein-Gordon conserved operators in
  Taub-NUT background
</title>

<abstract>
  The algebra of conserved observables of the SO(4,1) gauge-invariant theory of
the Dirac fermions in the external field of the Kaluza-Klein monopole is
investigated. It is shown that the Dirac conserved operators have physical
parts associated with Pauli operators that are also conserved in the sense of
the Klein-Gordon theory. In this way one gets simpler methods of analyzing the
properties of the conserved Dirac operators and their main algebraic structures
including the representations of dynamical algebras governing the Dirac quantum
modes.
