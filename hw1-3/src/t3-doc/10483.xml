Entropy for Asymptotically AdS_3 Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose that Strominger's method to derive the BTZ black hole entropy is
in fact applicable to other asymptotically AdS_3 black holes and gives the
correct functional form of entropies. We discuss various solutions in the
Einstein-Maxwell theory, dilaton gravity, Einstein-scalar theories, and
Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. In some cases, solutions approach AdS_3
asymptotically, but their entropies do not have the form of Cardy's formula.
However, it turns out that they are actually not "asymptotically $AdS_3$"
solutions. On the other hand, for truly asymptotically AdS_3 solutions, their
entropies have the form of Cardy's formula. In this sense, all known solutions
are consistent with our proposal.
