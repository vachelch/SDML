From Super-AdS_5xS^5 Algebra to Super-pp-wave Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The isometry algebras of the maximally supersymmetric solutions of IIB
supergravity are derived by the Inonu-Wigner contractions of the
super-AdS_5xS^5 algebra. The super-AdS_5xS^5 algebra allows introducing two
contraction parameters; the one for the Penrose limit to the maximally
supersymmetric pp-wave algebra and the AdS_5xS^5 radius for the flat limit. The
fact that the Jacobi identity of three supercharges holds irrespectively of
these parameters reflects the fact that the number of supersymmetry is not
affected under both contractions.
