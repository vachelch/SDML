Picard-Fuchs Ordinary Differential Systems in N=2 Supersymmetric
  Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In general, Picard-Fuchs systems in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories
are realized as a set of simultaneous partial differential equations. However,
if the QCD scale parameter is used as unique independent variable instead of
moduli, the resulting Picard-Fuchs systems are represented by a single ordinary
differential equation (ODE) whose order coincides with the total number of
independent periods. This paper discusses some properties of these Picard-Fuchs
ODEs. In contrast with the usual Picard-Fuchs systems written in terms of
moduli derivatives, there exists a Wronskian for this ordinary differential
system and this Wronskian produces a new relation among periods, moduli and QCD
scale parameter, which in the case of SU(2) is reminiscent of scaling relation
of prepotential. On the other hand, in the case of the SU(3) theory, there are
two kinds of ordinary differential equations, one of which is the equation
directly constructed from periods and the other is derived from the SU(3)
Picard-Fuchs equations in moduli derivatives identified with Appell's $F_4$
hypergeometric system, i.e., Burchnall's fifth order ordinary differential
equation published in 1942. It is shown that four of the five independent
solutions to the latter equation actually correspond to the four periods in the
SU(3) gauge theory and the closed form of the remaining one is established by
the SU(3) Picard-Fuchs ODE. The formula for this fifth solution is a new one.
