Supersymmetry breaking in M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the breaking of supersymmetry in M-theory by coordinate dependent
(Scherk-Schwarz) compactification of the eleventh dimension. Supersymmetry is
spontaneously broken in the gravitational and moduli sector and communicated to
the observable sector, living at the end-point of the semicircle, by radiative
gravitational interactions. This mechanism shares the generic features of
non-perturbative supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation, in the
presence of a constant antisymmetric field strength, in the weakly coupled
regime of the heterotic string, which suggests that both mechanisms could be
related by duality. In particular an analysis of supersymmetric transformations
in the infinite-radius limit reveals the presence of a discontinuity in the
spinorial parameter, which coincides with the result found in the presence of
gaugino condensation, while the condensate is identified with the quantized
parameter entering the boundary conditions
