<title>
Quantum Field Theory with Nonzero Minimal Uncertainties in Positions and
  Momenta
</title>

<abstract>
  A noncommutative geometric generalisation of the quantum field theoretical
framework is developed by generalising the Heisenberg commutation relations.
There appear nonzero minimal uncertainties in positions and in momenta. As the
main result it is shown with the example of a quadratically ultraviolet
divergent graph in $\phi^4$ theory that nonzero minimal uncertainties in
positions do have the power to regularise. These studies are motivated with the
ansatz that nonzero minimal uncertainties in positions and in momenta arise
from gravity. Algebraic techniques are used that have been developed in the
field of quantum groups.
