Calogero-Moser Lax Pairs with Spectral Parameter for General Lie
  Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a Lax pair with spectral parameter for the elliptic
Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian systems associated with each of the finite
dimensional Lie algebras, of the classical and of the exceptional type. When
the spectral parameter equals one of the three half periods of the elliptic
curve, our result for the classical Lie algebras reduces to one of the Lax
pairs without spectral parameter that were known previously. These
Calogero-Moser systems are invariant under the Weyl group of the associated
untwisted affine Lie algebra. For non-simply laced Lie algebras, we introduce
new integrable systems, naturally associated with twisted affine Lie algebras,
and construct their Lax operators with spectral parameter (except in the case
of $G_2$).
