Fast-Roll Inflation
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that in the simplest theories of spontaneous symmetry breaking one
can have a stage of a fast-roll inflation. In this regime the standard
slow-roll condition |m^2| << H^2 is violated. Nevertheless, this stage can be
rather long if |m| is sufficiently small. Fast-roll inflation can be useful for
generating proper initial conditions for the subsequent stage of slow-roll
inflation in the very early universe. It may also be responsible for the
present stage of accelerated expansion of the universe. We also make two
observations of a more general nature. First of all, the universe after a long
stage of inflation (either slow-roll or fast-roll) cannot reach anti-de Sitter
regime even if the cosmological constant is negative. Secondly, the theories
with the potentials with a "stable" minimum at V(\phi)<0 in the cosmological
background exhibit the same instability as the theories with potentials
unbounded from below. This instability leads to the development of singularity
with the properties practically independent of V(\phi). However, the
development of the instability in some cases may be so slow that the theories
with the potentials unbounded from below can describe the present stage of
cosmic acceleration even if this acceleration occurs due to the fast-roll
inflation.
