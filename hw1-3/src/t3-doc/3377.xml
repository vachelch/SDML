<title>
Stabilizing the gravitational action and Coleman's solution to the
  cosmological constant problem
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the 5-th time action formalism introduced by Halpern and Greensite to
stabilize the unbounded Euclidean 4-D gravity in two simple minisuperspace
models. In particular, we show that, at the semiclassical level ($\hbar
\rightarrow 0$), we still have as a leading saddle point the $S^4$ solution and
the Coleman peak at zero cosmological constant, for a fixed De Witt
supermetric. At the quantum (one-loop) level the scalar gravitational modes
give a positive semi-definite Hessian contribution to the 5-D partition
function, thus removing the Polchinski phase ambiguity.
