CP Violation and Dilaton Stabilization in Heterotic String Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the possibility of spontaneous CP violation in string models with
the dilaton field stabilized at a phenomenologically acceptable value. We
consider three mechanisms to stabilize the dilaton: multiple gaugino
condensates, a nonperturbative Kahler potential, and a superpotential based on
S-duality, and analyze consequent CP phases in the soft SUSY breaking terms.
Due to non-universality forced upon the theory by requiring a non-trivial CKM
phase, the EDM problem becomes more severe. Even if there are no complex phases
in the VEVs of the SUSY breaking fields, the electric dipole moments are
overproduced by orders of magnitude. We also address the question of modular
invariance of the physical CP phases.
