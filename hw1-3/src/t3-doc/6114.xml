<title>
An N=2 Superconformal Fixed Point with E_6 Global Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the elliptic curve corresponding to an $N=2$ superconformal field
theory which has an $E_6$ global symmetry at the strong coupling point
$\tau=e^{\pi i/3}$. We also find the Seiberg-Witten differential $\lambda_{SW}$
for this theory. This differential has 27 poles corresponding to the
fundamental representation of $E_6$. The complex conjugate representation has
its poles on the other sheet. We also show that the $E_6$ curve reduces to the
$D_4$ curve of Seiberg and Witten. Finally, we compute the monodromies and use
these to compute BPS masses in an $F$-Theory compactification.
