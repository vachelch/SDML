On Ghost Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  The path integral for ghost fermions, which is heuristically made use of in
the Batalin- Fradkin-Vilkovisky approach to quantization of constrained
systems, is derived from first principles. The derivation turns out to be
rather different from that of physical fermions since the definition of Dirac
states for ghost fermions is subtle. With these results at hand, it is then
shown that the nonminimal extension of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin operator
must be chosen differently from the notorious choice made in the literature in
order to avoid the boundary terms that have always plagued earlier treatments.
Furthermore it is pointed out that the elimination of states with nonzero ghost
number requires the introduction of a thermodynamic potential for ghosts; the
reason is that Schwarz's Lefschetz formula for the partition function of the
time- evolution operator is not capable, despite claims to the contrary, to get
rid of nonzero ghost number states on its own. Finally, we comment on the
problems of global topological nature that one faces in the attempt to obtain
the solutions of the Dirac condition for physical states in a configuration
space of nontrivial geometry; such complications give rise to anomalies that do
not obey the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions.
