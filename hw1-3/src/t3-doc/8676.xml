<title>
Higher-dimensional resolution of dilatonic black hole singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the four-dimensional extreme dilaton black hole with dilaton
coupling constant $a= \sqrt{p/(p+2)}$ can be interpreted as a {\it completely
non-singular}, non-dilatonic, black $p$-brane in $(4+p)$ dimensions provided
that $p$ is {\it odd}. Similar results are obtained for multi-black holes and
dilatonic extended objects in higher spacetime dimensions. The non-singular
black $p$-brane solutions include the self-dual three brane of ten-dimensional
N=2B supergravity and a multi-fivebrane solution of eleven-dimensional
supergravity. In the case of a supersymmetric non-dilatonic $p$-brane solution
of a supergravity theory, we show that it saturates a bound on the energy per
unit $p$-volume.
