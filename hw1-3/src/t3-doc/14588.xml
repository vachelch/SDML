<title>
On a CFT prediction in the sine-Gordon model
</title>

<abstract>
  A quantitative prediction of Conformal Field Theory (CFT), which relates the
second moment of the energy-density correlator away from criticality to the
value of the central charge, is verified in the sine-Gordon model. By
exploiting the boson-fermion duality of two-dimensional field theories, this
result also allows to show the validity of the prediction in the strong
coupling regime of the Thirring model.
