Transverse Spin in QCD: Radiative Corrections
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we address various issues connected with transverse spin in
light front QCD. The transverse spin operators, in $A^+ = 0$ gauge, expressed
in terms of the dynamical variables are explicitly interaction dependent unlike
the helicity operator which is interaction independent in the topologically
trivial sector of light-front QCD. Although it cannot be separated into an
orbital and a spin part, we have shown that there exists an interesting
decomposition of the transverse spin operator. We discuss the physical
relevance of such a decomposition. We perform a one loop renormalization of the
full transverse spin operator in light-front Hamiltonian perturbation theory
for a dressed quark state. We explicitly show that all the terms dependent on
the center of mass momenta get canceled in the matrix element. The entire
non-vanishing contribution comes from the fermion intrinsic -like part of the
transverse spin operator as a result of cancellation between the gluonic
intrinsic-like and the orbital-like part of the transverse spin operator. We
compare and contrast the calculations of transverse spin and helicity of a
dressed quark in perturbation theory.
