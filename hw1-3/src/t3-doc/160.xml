BRST-Antibracket Cohomology in 2D Conformal Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present results of a computation of the BRST-antibracket cohomology in the
space of local functionals of the fields and antifields for a class of 2d
gravitational theories which are conformally invariant at the classical level.
In particular all classical local action functionals, all candidate anomalies
and all BRST--invariant functionals depending nontrivially on antifields are
given and discussed for these models.
