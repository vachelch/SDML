Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem and Quark Confinement in SU(N) Yang-Mills
  Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a new version of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for the Wilson loop
in the SU(N) case by making use of the coherent state representation on the
coset space $SU(N)/U(1)^{N-1}=F_{N-1}$, the flag space. We consider the SU(N)
Yang-Mills theory in the maximal Abelian gauge in which SU(N) is broken down to
$U(1)^{N-1}$. First, we show that the Abelian dominance in the string tension
follows from this theorem and the Abelian-projected effective gauge theory that
was derived by one of the authors. Next (but independently), combining the
non-Abelian Stokes theorem with a novel reformulation of the Yang-Mills theory
recently proposed by one of the authors, we proceed to derive the area law of
the Wilson loop in four-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in the maximal
Abelian gauge. Owing to dimensional reduction, the planar Wilson loop at least
for the fundamental representation in four-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory
can be estimated by the diagonal (Abelian) Wilson loop defined in the
two-dimensional $CP^{N-1}$ model. This derivation shows that the fundamental
quarks are confined by a single species of magnetic monopole. The origin of the
area law is related to the geometric phase of the Wilczek-Zee holonomy for
$U(N-1)$. The calculations are performed using the instanton calculus (in the
dilute instanton-gas approximation) and using the large $N$ expansion (in the
leading order).
