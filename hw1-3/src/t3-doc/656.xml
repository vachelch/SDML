<title>
Baryons and Flux Tubes in Confining Gauge Theories from Brane Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study baryon configurations in large N non-supersymmetric SU(N) gauge
theories, applying the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using the D5-brane worldvolume
theory in the near-horizon geometry of non-extremal D3-branes, we find
embeddings which describe baryonic states in three-dimensional QCD. In
particular, we construct solutions corresponding to a baryon made of N quarks,
and study what happens when some fraction $\nu$ of the total number of quarks
are bodily moved to a large spatial separation from the others. The individual
clumps of quarks are represented by Born-Infeld string tubes obtained from a
D5-brane whose spatial section has topology $R \times S^4$. They are connected
by a confining color flux tube, described by a portion of the fivebrane that
runs very close and parallel to the horizon. We find that this flux tube has a
tension with a nontrivial $\nu$-dependence (not previously obtained by other
methods). A similar picture is presented for the four-dimensional case.
