<title>
Possible Physical Manifestation of the Weyl Non-Abelian Gauge Field
</title>

<abstract>
  On the basis of the Weyl equations of congruent transference, we consider a
possible influence of the Weyl non-Abelian gauge field defining the
transference on the precession of a gyroscope. Plane-wave solutions to the
equations of the non-Abelian gauge field are derived.
