<title>
Gauge Dual and Noncommutative Extension of an N=2 Supergravity Solution
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate some properties of a recent supergravity solution of Pilch and
Warner, which is dual to the N=4 gauge theory softly broken to N=2. We verify
that a D3-brane probe has the expected moduli space and its effective action
can be brought to N=2 form. The kinetic term for the probe vanishes on an
enhancon locus, as in earlier work on large-n N=2 theories, though for the
Pilch-Warner solution this locus is a line rather than a ring. On the gauge
theory side we find that the probe metric can be obtained from a perturbative
one-loop calculation; this principle may be useful in obtaining the
supergravity dual at more general points in the N=2 gauge theory moduli space.
We then turn on a B-field, following earlier work on the N=4 theory, to obtain
the supergravity dual to the noncommutative N=2 theory.
