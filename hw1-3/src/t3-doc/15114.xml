<title>
Sine-Gordon Solitons and Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  In the talk, the relationship between black holes in Jackiw-Teitelboim(JT)
dilaton gravity and solitons in sine-Gordon field theory is described. The
well-known connection between solutions of the sine-Gordon equation and
constant curvature metrics is reviewed and expanded. In particular, it is shown
that solutions to the dilaton field equations for a given metric in JT theory
also solve the sine-Gordon equation linearized about the corresponding soliton.
Next, it is shown that from the B${\ddot a}$cklund transformations relating
different soliton solutions, it is possible to construct a flat SL(2,R)
connection which forms the basis for the gauge theory formulation of JT dilaton
gravity. Finally, the supersymmetric generalization of sine-Gordon theory is
reviewed, leading to a new approach to the problem of the origin of low
dimensional black hole entropy.
