Seiberg-Witten Transforms of Noncommutative Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate the Seiberg-Witten map for solitons and instantons in
noncommutative gauge theories in various dimensions. We show that solitons
constructed using the projection operators have delta-function supports when
expressed in the commutative variables. This gives a precise identification of
the moduli of these solutions as locations of branes. On the other hand, an
instanton solution in four dimensions allows deformation away from the
projection operator construction. We evaluate the Seiberg-Witten transform of
the U(2) instanton and show that it has a finite size determined by the
noncommutative scale and by the deformation parameter \rho. For large \rho, the
profile of the D0-brane density of the instanton agrees surprisingly well with
that of the BPST instanton on commutative space.
