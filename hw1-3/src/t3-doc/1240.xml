Transport Coefficients and Analytic Continuation in Dual 1+1 Dimensional
  Models at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The conductivity of a finite temperature 1+1 dimensional fermion gas
described by the massive Thirring model is shown to be related to the retarded
propagator of the dual boson sine-Gordon model. Duality provides a natural
resummation which resolves infra-red problems, and the boson propagator can be
related to the fermion gas at non-zero temperature and chemical potential or
density. In addition, at high temperatures, we can apply a dimensional
reduction technique to find resummed closed expressions for the boson
self-energy and relate them to the fermion conductivity. Particular attention
is paid to the discussion of analytic continuation. The resummation implicit in
duality provides a powerful alternative to the standard diagrammatic evaluation
of transport coefficients at finite temperature.
