The Spectrum of N=3 String Theory on AdS_3 x G/H
</title>

<abstract>
  We continue the study of string theory on AdS_3 x SU(3)/U(1) and AdS_3 x
SO(5)/SO(3). We compute the spacetime spectrum of the N=3 supersymmetric dual
CFT using worldsheet techniques. The spectrum of chiral primaries coincides for
the two models. Unlike N=4 theories, the building block of the symmetric
product in spacetime (corresponding to a single long string) is not by itself
in the moduli space of a symmetric product.
