Brane-Bulk Duality and Non-conformal Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss non-conformal gauge theories from type IIB D3-branes embedded in
orbifolded space-times. Such theories can be obtained by allowing some
non-vanishing logarithmic twisted tadpoles. In certain cases with N=0,1
supersymmetry correlation functions in the planar limit are the same as in the
parent N=2 supersymmetric theories. In particular, the effective action in such
theories perturbatively is not renormalized beyond one loop in the planar
limit. In the N=2 as well as such N=0,1 theories quantum corrections in the
D3-brane gauge theories are encoded in the corresponding classical higher
dimensional field theories whose actions contain the twisted fields with
non-vanishing tadpoles. We argue that this duality can be extended to the
non-perturbative level in the N=2 theories. We give some evidence that this
might also be the case for N=0,1 theories as well.
