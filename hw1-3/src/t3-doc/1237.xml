<title>
The Calculus of Many Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the modern formalism, ideas and applications of the instanton
calculus for gauge theories with, and without, supersymmetry. Particular
emphasis is put on developing a formalism that can deal with any number of
instantons. This necessitates a thorough review of the ADHM construction of
instantons with arbitrary charge and an in-depth analysis of the resulting
moduli space of solutions. We review the construction of the ADHM moduli space
as a hyper-Kahler quotient. We show how the functional integral in the
semi-classical approximation reduces to an integral over the instanton moduli
space in each instanton sector and how the resulting matrix partition function
involves various geometrical quantities on the instanton moduli space: volume
form, connection, curvature, isometries, etc. One important conclusion is that
this partition function is the dimensional reduction of a higher-dimensional
gauged linear sigma model which naturally leads us to describe the relation of
the instanton calculus to D-branes in string theory. Along the way we describe
powerful applications of the calculus of many instantons to supersymmetric
gauge theories including (i) the gluino condensate puzzle in N=1 theories (ii)
Seiberg-Witten theory in N=2 theories; and (iii) the AdS/CFT correspondence in
N=2 and N=4 theories. Finally, we briefly review the modifications of the
instanton calculus for a gauge theory defined on a non-commutative spacetime
and we also describe a new method for calculating instanton processes using a
form of localization on the instanton moduli space.
