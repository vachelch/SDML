D-branes, Symplectomorphisms and Noncommutative Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the dual of the double compactified D=11 Supermembrane and a
suitable compactified D=10 Super 4D-brane with nontrivial wrapping on the
target space may be formulated as noncommutative gauge theories. The Poisson
bracket over the world-volume is intrinsically defined in terms of the minima
of the hamiltonian of the theory, which may be expressed in terms of a non
degenerate 2-form. A deformation of the Poisson bracket in terms of the Moyal
brackets is then performed. A noncommutative gauge theory in terms of the Moyal
star bracket is obtained. It is shown that all these theories may be described
in terms of symplectic connections on symplectic fibrations. The world volume
being its base manifold and the (sub)group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms
generate the symplectomorphisms which preserve the (infinite dimensional)
Poisson bracket of the fibration.
