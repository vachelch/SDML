<title>
Wilson Renormalization Group Equations for the Critical Dynamics of
  Chiral Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The critical dynamics of the chiral symmetry breaking induced by gauge
interaction is examined in the Wilson renormalization group framework in
comparison with the Schwinger-Dyson approach. We derive the beta functions for
the four-fermi couplings in the sharp cutoff renormalzation group scheme, from
which the critical couplings and the anomalous dimensions of the fermion
composite operators near criticality are immediately obtained. It is also shown
that the beta functions lead to the same critical behavior found by solving the
so-called ladder Schwinger-Dyson equation, if we restrict the radiative
corrections to a certain limited type.
