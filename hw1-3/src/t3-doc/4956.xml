The Endpoint of Hawking Evaporation
</title>

<abstract>
  The formation and semi-classical evaporation of two-dimensional black holes
is studied in an exactly solvable model. Above a certain threshold energy flux,
collapsing matter forms a singularity inside an apparent horizon. As the black
hole evaporates the apparent horizon recedes and meets the singularity in a
finite proper time. The singularity emerges naked and future evolution of the
geometry requires boundary conditions to be imposed there. There is a natural
choice of boundary conditions which match the evaporated black hole solution
onto the linear dilaton vacuum. Below the threshold energy flux no horizon
forms and boundary conditions can be imposed where infalling matter is
reflected from a time-like naked singularity. All information is recovered at
spatial infinity in this case.
