Phases of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We exhibit $N=1$ supersymmetric field theories in confining, Coulomb and
Higgs phases. The superpotential and the gauge kinetic terms are holomorphic
and can be determined exactly in the various phases. The Coulomb phase
generically has points with massless monopoles. When they condense, the theory
undergoes a phase transition to a confining phase. When there are points in the
Coulomb phase with massless electric charges, their condensation leads to a
transition to a Higgs phase. When the Higgs and confinement phases are
distinct, we expect to find massless interacting gluons at the transition point
between them.
