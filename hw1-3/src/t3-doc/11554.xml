W-strings from N=2 Hamiltonian reduction and classification of N=2 super
  W-algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an algebraic approach to string theory, using a Hamiltonian
reduction of N=2 WZW models. An embedding of sl(1|2) in a Lie superalgebra
determines a niltopent subalgebra. Chirally gauging this subalgebra in the
corresponding WZW action leads to an extension of the N=2 superconformal
algebra. We classify all the embeddings of sl(1|2) into Lie superalgebras: this
provides an exhaustive classification and characterization of all extended N=2
superconformal algebras. Then, twisting these algebras, we obtain the BRST
structure of a string theory. We characterize and classify all the string
theories which can be obtained in this way.
  Based on a common work of E.  Ragoucy, A. Sevrin and P. Sorba,
