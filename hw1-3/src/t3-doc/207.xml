SO/Sp Monopoles and Branes with Orientifold 3 Plane
</title>

<abstract>
  We study BPS monopoles in 4 dimensional N=4 SO(N) and $Sp(N)$ super
Yang-Mills theories realized as the low energy effective theory of $N$
(physical and its mirror) parallel D3 branes and an {\it Orientifold 3 plane}
with D1 branes stretched between them in type IIB string theory. Monopoles on
D3 branes give the natural understanding by embedding in SU(N) through the
constraints on both the asymptotic Higgs field (corresponding to the horizontal
positions of D3 branes) and the magnetic charges (corresponding to the number
of D1 branes) imposed by the O3 plane. The compatibility conditions of Nahm
data for monopoles for these groups can be interpreted very naturally through
the D1 branes in the presence of O3 plane.
