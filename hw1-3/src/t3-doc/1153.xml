Spectral Geometry and One-loop Divergences on Manifolds with Conical
  Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  Geometrical form of the one-loop divergences induced by conical singularities
of background manifolds is studied. To this aim the heat kernel asymptotic
expansion on spaces having the structure $C_{\alpha}\times \Sigma$ near
singular surface $\Sigma$ is analysed. Surface corrections to standard second
and third heat coefficients are obtained explicitly in terms of angle $\alpha$
of a cone $C_{\alpha}$ and components of the Riemann tensor. These results are
compared to ones to be already known for some particular cases. Physical
aspects of the surface divergences are shortly discussed.
