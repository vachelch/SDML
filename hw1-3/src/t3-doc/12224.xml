Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective potential for canonical
  noncommutative field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) formalism to the scalar $\lambda
\phi^{4}$ theory in canonical-noncommutative spacetime. We construct the CJT
effective potential and the gap equation for general values of the
noncommutative parameter $\theta_{\mu\nu}$. We observe that under the
hypothesis of translational invariance, which is assumed in the effective
potential construction, differently from the commutative case
($\theta_{\mu\nu}= 0$), the renormalizability of the gap equation is
incompatible with the renormalizability of the effective potential. We argue
that our result, is consistent with previous studies suggesting that a uniform
ordered phase would be inconsistent with the infrared structure of canonical
noncommutative theories.
