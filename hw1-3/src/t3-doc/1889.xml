Gravitational instantons, extra dimensions and form fields
</title>

<abstract>
  A broad class of higher dimensional instanton solutions are found for a
theory which contains gravity, a scalar field and antisymmetric tensor fields
of arbitrary rank. The metric used, a warp product of an arbitrary number of
any compact Einstein manifolds, includes many of great interest in particle
physics and cosmology. For example 4D FRW universes with additional dimensions
compactified on a Calabi-Yau three fold, a torus, a compact hyperbolic manifold
or a sphere are all included. It is shown that the solution of this form which
dominates the Hartle Hawking path integral is always a higher dimensional
generalisation of a Hawking Turok instanton when the potential of the scalar
field is such that these instantons can exist. On continuation to Lorentzian
signature such instantons give rise to a spacetime in which all of the spatial
dimensions are of equal size and where the spatial topology is that of a
sphere. The extra dimensions are thus not hidden. In the case where the
potential for the scalar field is generated solely by a dilatonic coupling to
the form fields we find no integrable instantons at all. In particular we find
no integrable solutions of the type under consideration for the supergravity
theories which are the low energy effective field theories of superstrings.
