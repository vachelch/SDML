D=10 super-D9-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  Superfield equations of motion for D=10 type IIB Dirichlet super-9-brane are
obtained from the generalized action principle. The geometric equations
containing fermionic superembedding equations and constraints on the
generalized field strength of Abelian gauge field are separated from the proper
dynamical equations and are found to contain these dynamical equations among
their consequences. The set of superfield equations thus obtained involves a
Spin(1,9) group valued superfield $h_\a^{~\b}$ whose leading component appears
in the recently obtained simplified expression for the kappa-symmetry
projector of the D9-brane. The Cayley image of this superfield coincides (on
the mass shell) with the field strength tensor of the world volume gauge field
characteristic for the Dirichlet brane. The superfield description of the
super-9-brane obtained in this manner is known to be, on the one hand, the
nonlinear (Born-Infeld) generalization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
and, on the other hand, the theory of partial spontaneous breaking of D=10,
N=IIB supersymmetry down to D=10, N=1.
