Massive Quantum Vortex Excitations in a Pure Gauge Abelian Theory in
  2+1D
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce and study a pure gauge abelian theory in 2+1D in which massive
quantum vortex states do exist in the spectrum of excitations. This theory can
be mapped in a three dimensional gas of point particles with a logarithmic
interaction, in the grand-canonical ensemble. We claim that this theory is the
2+1D analog of the Sine-Gordon, the massive vortices being the counterparts of
Sine-Gordon solitons. We show that a symmetry breaking, order parameter,
similar to the vacuum expectation value of a Higgs field does exist.
