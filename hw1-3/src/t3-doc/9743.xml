M Theory Fivebrane and Confining Phase of N=1 $SO(N_c)$ Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The moduli space of vacua for the confining phase of N=1 $SO(N_c)$
supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions is analyzed by studying the M
theory fivebrane. The type IIA brane configuration consists of a single NS5
brane, multiple copies of NS'5 branes, D4 branes between them, and D6 branes
intersecting D4 branes. We construct M theory fivebrane configuration
corresponding to the superpotential perturbation where the power of adjoint
field is connected to the number of NS'5 branes. At a singular point in the
moduli space where mutually local dyons become massless, the quadratic
degeneracy of the N=2 $SO(N_c)$ hyperelliptic curve determines whether this
singular point gives a N=1 vacua or not. The comparison of the meson vevs in M
theory fivebrane configuration with field theory results turns out that the
effective superpotential by the integrating in method with enhanced gauge group
SU(2) is exact.
