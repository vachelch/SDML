The Berry Phase and Monopoles in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the quantum mechanical notion of the geometrical (Berry) phase in
SU(2) gauge theory, both in the continuum and on the lattice. It is shown that
in the coherent state basis eigenvalues of the Wilson loop operator naturally
decompose into the geometrical and dynamical phase factors. Moreover, for each
Wilson loop there is a unique choice of U(1) gauge rotations which do not
change the value of the Berry phase. Determining this U(1) locally in terms of
infinitesimal Wilson loops we define monopole-like defects and study their
properties in numerical simulations on the lattice. The construction is gauge
dependent, as is common for all known definitions of monopoles. We argue that
for physical applications the use of the Lorenz gauge is most appropriate. And,
indeed, the constructed monopoles have the correct continuum limit in this
gauge. Physical consequences are briefly discussed.
