<title>
Singlet Couplings and (0,2) Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the quantum symmetries present in string compactification on
Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds to prove the existence of a large class of exactly
marginal (0,2) deformations of (2,2) superconformal theories. Analogous methods
apply to the more general (0,2) models introduced in \DK, lending further
credence to the fact that the corresponding \LG\ models represent bona-fide
(0,2) SCFTs. We also use the large symmetry groups which arise when the
worldsheet superpotential is turned off to constrain the dependence of certain
correlation functions on the untwisted moduli. This allows us to approach the
problem of what happens when one tries to deform away from the \LG\ point. In
particular, we find that the masses and three-point couplings of the massless
$E_{6}$ singlets related to ${\rm H^{1}}(\ET)$ vanish at all points in the
quintic \Ka\ moduli space. Putting these results together, and invoking some
plausible dynamical assumptions about the corresponding linear \sm s, we show
that one can deform these \LG\ theories to arbitrary values of the \Ka\ moduli.
