Stress Tensors and Casimir Energies in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss various approaches to extracting the full stress-energy tensor of
the conformal field theory from the corresponding supergravity solutions,
within the framework of the Maldacena conjecture. This provides a more refined
probe of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We apply these techniques in considering
the Casimir energy of the conformal field theory on a torus. It seems that
either generically the corresponding supergravity solutions are singular (i.e.,
involve regions of large string-scale curvatures), or that they are largely
insensitive to the boundary conditions of the CFT on the torus.
