Calogero-Moser Systems in SU(N) Seiberg-Witten Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The Seiberg-Witten curve and differential for ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric
SU(N) gauge theory, with a massive hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation
of the gauge group, are analyzed in terms of the elliptic Calogero-Moser
integrable system. A new parametrization for the Calogero-Moser spectral curves
is found, which exhibits the classical vacuum expectation values of the scalar
field of the gauge multiplet. The one-loop perturbative correction to the
effective prepotential is evaluated explicitly, and found to agree with quantum
field theory predictions. A renormalization group equation for the variation
with respect to the coupling is derived for the effective prepotential, and may
be evaluated in a weak coupling series using residue methods only. This gives a
simple and efficient algorithm for the instanton corrections to the effective
prepotential to any order. The 1- and 2- instanton corrections are derived
explicitly. Finally, it is shown that certain decoupling limits yield ${\cal
N}=2$ supersymmetric theories for simple gauge groups $SU(N_1)$ with
hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation, while others yield theories
for product gauge groups $SU(N_1) \times ...\times SU(N_p)$, with
hypermultiplets in fundamental and bi-fundamental representations. The spectral
curves obtained this way for these models agree with the ones proposed by
Witten using D-branes and M-theory.
