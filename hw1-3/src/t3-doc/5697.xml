Geodesics and Newton's Law in Brane Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  In brane world models our universe is considered as a brane imbedded into a
higher dimensional space. We discuss the behaviour of geodesics in the
Randall-Sundrum background and point out that free massive particles cannot
move along the brane only. The brane is repulsive, and matter will be expelled
from the brane into the extra dimension. This is rather undesirable, and hence
we study an alternative model with a non-compact extra dimension, but with an
attractive brane embedded into the higher dimensional space. We study the
linearized gravity equations and show that Newton's gravitational law is valid
on the brane also in the alternative background.
