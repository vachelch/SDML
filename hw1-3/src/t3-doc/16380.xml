<title>
Compactifications of the N=2^* flow
</title>

<abstract>
  In hep-th/0004063 Pilch and Warner (PW) constructed N=2 supersymmetric RG
flow corresponding to the mass deformation of the N=4 SU(N) Yang-Mills theory.
In this paper we present exact deformations of PW flow when the gauge theory
3-space is compactified on S^3. We consider also the case with the gauge theory
world-volume being dS_4 instead of R^{3,1}. The solution is constructed in
five-dimensional gauged supergravity and is further uplifted to 10d.
