<title>
Matrix Models and Geometry of Moduli Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We give the description of discretized moduli spaces (d.m.s.) $\Mcdisc$
introduced in \cite{Ch1} in terms of discrete de Rham cohomologies for moduli
spaces $\Mgn$. The generating function for intersection indices (cohomological
classes) of d.m.s. is found. Classes of highest degree coincide with the ones
for the continuum moduli space $\Mc$. To show it we use a matrix model
technique. The Kontsevich matrix model is the generating function in the
continuum case, and the matrix model with the potential $N\alpha \tr {\bigl(-
\fr 14 \L X\L X -\fr12\log (1-X)-\fr12X\bigr)}$ is the one for d.m.s. In the
latest case the effects of Deligne--Mumford reductions become relevant, and we
use the stratification procedure in order to express integrals over open spaces
$\Mdisc$ in terms of intersection indices, which are to be calculated on
compactified spaces $\Mcdisc$. We find and solve constraint equations on
partition function $\cal Z$ of our matrix model expressed in times for d.m.s.:
$t^\pm_m=\tr \fr{\d^m}{\d\l^m}\fr1{\e^\l-1}$. It appears that $\cal Z$ depends
only on even times and ${\cal Z}[t^\pm_\cdot]=C(\aa N) \e^{\cal
A}\e^{F(\{t^{-}_{2n}\}) +F(\{-t^{+}_{2n}\})}$, where $F(\{t^\pm_{2n}\})$ is a
logarithm of the partition function of the Kontsevich model, $\cal A$ being a
quadratic differential operator in $\dd{t^\pm_{2n}}$.
