<title>
Supersymmetry and superalgebra for the two-body system with a Dirac
  oscillator interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  Some years ago, one of the authors~(MM) revived a concept to which he gave
the name of single-particle Dirac oscillator, while another~(CQ) showed that it
corresponds to a realization of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The Dirac
oscillator in its one- and many-body versions has had a great number of
applications. Recently, it included the analytic expression for the eigenstates
and eigenvalues of a two-particle system with a new type of Dirac oscillator
interaction of frequency~$\omega$. By considering the latter together with its
partner corresponding to the replacement of~$\omega$ by~$-\omega$, we are able
to get a supersymmetric formulation of the problem and find the superalgebra
that explains its degeneracy.
