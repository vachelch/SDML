Folded Strings Falling into a Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We find all the classical solutions (minimal surfaces) of open or closed
strings in {\it any} two dimensional curved spacetime. As examples we consider
the SL(2,R)/R two dimensional black hole, and any 4D black hole in the
Schwarzschild family, provided the motion is restricted to the time-radial
components. The solutions, which describe longitudinaly oscillating folded
strings (radial oscillations in 4D), must be given in lattice-like patches of
the worldsheet, and a transfer operation analogous to a transfer matrix
determines the future evolution. Then the swallowing of a string by a black
hole is analyzed. We find several new features that are not shared by particle
motions. The most surprizing effect is the tunneling of the string into the
bare singularity region that lies beyond the black hole that is classically
forbidden to particles.
