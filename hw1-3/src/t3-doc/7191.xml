<title>
Polynomial invariants for torus knots and topological strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We make a precision test of a recently proposed conjecture relating
Chern-Simons gauge theory to topological string theory on the resolution of the
conifold. First, we develop a systematic procedure to extract string amplitudes
from vacuum expectation values (vevs) of Wilson loops in Chern-Simons gauge
theory, and then we evaluate these vevs in arbitrary irreducible
representations of SU(N) for torus knots. We find complete agreement with the
predictions derived from the target space interpretation of the string
amplitudes. We also show that the structure of the free energy of topological
open string theory gives further constraints on the Chern-Simons vevs. Our work
provides strong evidence towards an interpretation of knot polynomial
invariants as generating functions associated to enumerative problems.
