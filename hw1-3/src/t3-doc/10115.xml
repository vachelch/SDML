A Note on Embedding of M-Theory Corrections into Eleven-Dimensional
  Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  By analyzing eleven-dimensional superspace fourth-rank superfield strength
F-Bianchi identities, we show that M-theory corrections to eleven-dimensional
supergravity can not be embedded into the mass dimension zero constraints, such
as the (\g^{a b})_{\a\b} X_{a b}{}^c or i (\g^{a_1... a_5})_{\a\b} X_{a_1...
a_5}{}^c -terms in the supertorsion constraint T_{\a\b}{}^c. The only possible
modification of superspace constraint at dimension zero is found to be the
scaling of F_{\a\b c d} like F_{\a\b c d} = (1/2) \big(\g_{c d}\big)_{\a\b}
e^\Phi for some real scalar superfield \Phi, which alone is further shown not
enough to embed general M-theory corrections. This conclusion is based on the
dimension zero F-Bianchi identity under the two assumptions: (i) There are no
negative dimensional constraints on the F-superfield strength: F_{\a\b\g\d} =
F_{\a\b\g d} =0; (ii) The supertorsion T-Bianchi identities and F-Bianchi
identities are not modified by Chern-Simons terms. Our result can serve as a
powerful tool for future exploration of M-theory corrections embedded into
eleven-dimensional superspace supergravity.
