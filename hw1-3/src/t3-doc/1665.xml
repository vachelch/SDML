<title>
Sigma-model soliton intersections from exceptional calibrations
</title>

<abstract>
  A first-order `BPS' equation is obtained for 1/8 supersymmetric intersections
of soliton-membranes (lumps) of supersymmetric (4+1)-dimensional massless sigma
models, and a special non-singular solution is found that preserves 1/4
supersymmetry. For 4-dimensional hyper-K\"ahler target spaces ($HK_4$) the BPS
equation is shown to be the low-energy limit of the equation for a
Cayley-calibrated 4-surface in $\bE^4\times HK_4$. Similar first-order
equations are found for stationary intersections of Q-lump-membranes of the
massive sigma model, but now generic solutions preserve either 1/8
supersymmetry or no supersymmetry, depending on the time orientation.
