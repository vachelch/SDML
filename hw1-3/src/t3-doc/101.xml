Free Field Appoach to String Theory on AdS_3
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the correlation functions of the SL(2,C)/SU(2) WZW model, or the
CFT on the Euclidean AdS_3. We argue that their calculation is reduced to that
of a free theory by taking into account the renormalization and integrating out
a certain zero-mode, which is an analog of the zero-mode integration in
Liouville theory. Based on the resultant free field picture, we give a simple
prescription for calculating the correlation functions. The known exact two-
and three-point functions of generic primary fields are correctly obtained,
including numerical factors. We also obtain some four-point functions of
primaries by solving the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation, and verify that our
prescription indeed gives them.
