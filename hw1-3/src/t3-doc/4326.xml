<title>
Massive Vector Mesons and Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the requirements of renormalizability and physical consistency
imposed on perturbative interactions of massive vector mesons fix the theory
essentially uniquely. In particular physical consistency demands the presence
of at least one additional physical degree of freedom which was not part of the
originally required physical particle content. In its simplest realization
(probably the only one) these are scalar fields as envisaged by Higgs but in
the present formulation without the ``symmetry-breaking Higgs condensate''. The
final result agrees precisely with the usual quantization of a classical gauge
theory by means of the Higgs mechanism. Our method proves an old conjecture of
Cornwall, Levin and Tiktopoulos stating that the renormalization and
consistency requirements of spin=1 particles lead to the gauge theory structure
(i.e. a kind of inverse of 't Hooft's famous renormalizability proof in
quantized gauge theories) which was based on the on-shell unitarity of the
$S$-matrix. We also speculate on a possible future ghostfree formulation which
avoids ''field coordinates'' altogether and is expected to reconcile the
on-shell S-matrix point of view with the off-shell field theory structure.
