Supersymmetric M3-branes and G_2 Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain a generalisation of the original complete Ricci-flat metric of G_2
holonomy on R^4\times S^3 to a family with a non-trivial parameter \lambda. For
generic \lambda the solution is singular, but it is regular when
\lambda={-1,0,+1}. The case \lambda=0 corresponds to the original G_2 metric,
and \lambda ={-1,1} are related to this by an S_3 automorphism of the SU(2)^3
isometry group that acts on the S^3\times S^3 principal orbits. We then
construct explicit supersymmetric M3-brane solutions in D=11 supergravity,
where the transverse space is a deformation of this class of G_2 metrics. These
are solutions of a system of first-order differential equations coming from a
superpotential. We also find M3-branes in the deformed backgrounds of new
G_2-holonomy metrics that include one found by A. Brandhuber, J. Gomis, S.
Gubser and S. Gukov, and show that they also are supersymmetric.
