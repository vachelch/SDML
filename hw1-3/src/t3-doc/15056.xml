BFT Embedding of Interacting Second-Class Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  The embedding procedure of Batalin, Fradkin, and Tyutin, which allows to
convert a second-class system into a first-class one, is employed to convert
second-class interacting models. Two cases are considered. One, is the
Self-Dual model minimally coupled to a Dirac fermion field. The other, the
Self-Dual model minimally coupled to a charged scalar field. In both cases,
they are found equivalent interacting Maxwell-Chern-Simons type field theories.
These equivalences are pushed beyond the formal level, by analysing some tree
level probability amplitudes associated to the models.
