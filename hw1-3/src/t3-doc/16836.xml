<title>
Thermal effects in perturbative noncommutative gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The thermodynamics of gauge theories on the noncommutative plane is studied
in perturbation theory. For U(1) noncommutative Yang-Mills we compute the first
quantum correction to the ideal gas free energy density and study their
behavior in the low and high temperature regimes. Since the noncommutativity
scale effectively cutoff interactions at large distances, the theory is regular
in the infrared. In the case of U(N) noncommutative Yang-Mills we evaluate the
two-loop free energy density and find that it depends on the noncommutativity
parameter through the contribution of non-planar diagrams.
