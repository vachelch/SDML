Large N Dynamics of Dimensionally Reduced 4D SU(N) Super Yang-Mills
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform Monte Carlo simulations of a supersymmetric matrix model, which is
obtained by dimensional reduction of 4D SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory. The
model can be considered as a four-dimensional counterpart of the IIB matrix
model. We extract the space-time structure represented by the eigenvalues of
bosonic matrices. In particular we compare the large N behavior of the
space-time extent with the result obtained from a low energy effective theory.
We measure various Wilson loop correlators which represent string amplitudes
and we observe a nontrivial universal scaling in N. We also observe that the
Eguchi-Kawai equivalence to ordinary gauge theory does hold at least within a
finite range of scale. Comparison with the results for the bosonic case
clarifies the role of supersymmetry in the large N dynamics. It does affect the
multi-point correlators qualitatively, but the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence is
observed even in the bosonic case.
