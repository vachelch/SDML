<title>
$N$-Dimensional Representations of the Braid Groups $B_{N}$
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note, a new class of representations of the braid groups $B_{N}$ is
constructed. It is proved that those representations contain three kinds of
irreducible representations: the trivial (identity) one, the Burau one, and an
$N$-dimensional one. The explicit form of the $N$-dimensional irreducible
representation of the braid group $B_{N}$ is given here.
