<title>
Quantum Field Theory for Orthofermions and Orthobosons
</title>

<abstract>
  Orthofermi statistics is characterized by an exclusion principle which is
more ``exclusive'' than Pauli's exclusion principle: an orbital state shall not
contain more than one particle, no matter what the spin direction is. The
wavefunction is antisymmetric in spatial indices alone with arbitrary symmetry
in the spin indices. Orthobose statistics is corresponding Bose analog: the
wavefunction is symmetric in spatial indices, with arbitrary symmetry in spin
indices. We construct the quantum field theory of particles obeying these new
kinds of quantum statistics. Non-relativistic as well as relativistic quantum
field theories with interactions are considered.
