On the existence of spinning solitons in gauge field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the existence of classical soliton solutions with intrinsic angular
momentum in Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with a compact gauge group $\mathcal{G}$ in
3+1 dimensional Minkowski space. We show that for \textit{symmetric} gauge
fields the Noether charges corresponding to \textit{rigid} spatial symmetries,
as the angular momentum, can be expressed in terms of \textit{surface}
integrals. Using this result, we demonstrate the non-existence of stationary
and axially symmetric spinning excitations for all known topological solitons
in the case of $\mathcal{G}=SU(2)$, that is for 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles,
Julia-Zee dyons, sphalerons and also vortices.
