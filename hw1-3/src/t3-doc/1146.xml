Exact Superpotentials for Theories with Flavors via a Matrix Integral
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend and test the method of Dijkgraaf and Vafa for computing the
superpotential of N=1 theories to include flavors in the fundamental
representation of the gauge group. This amounts to computing the contribution
to the superpotential from surfaces with one boundary in the matrix integral.
We compute exactly the effective superpotential for the case of gauge group
U(N_c), N_f massive flavor chiral multiplets in the fundamental and one massive
chiral multiplet in the adjoint, together with a Yukawa coupling. We compare up
to sixth-order with the result obtained by standard field theory techniques in
the already non trivial case of N_c=2 and N_f=1. The agreement is perfect.
