Marginal perturbations of N=4 Yang-Mills as deformations of AdS$_5\times
  S^5$
</title>

<abstract>
  We study constant dilaton supersymmetric solutions of type IIB Supergravity
with 5-form and 3-form flux with isometry group U(1) $\times$$Z_3$. Some of
these solutions correspond to marginal perturbations of N=4 Yang-Mills. We find
one line of solutions in particular of AdS$_5$ fibred over an $S^5$. This line
is described by a single complex parameter. AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ is obtained when
this partameter is tuned to zero.
