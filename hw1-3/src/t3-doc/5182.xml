<title>
Non-Standard neutral kaons dynamics from D-brane statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  The neutral kaon system can be effectively described by non-unitary,
dissipative, completely positive dynamics that extend the usual treatment. In
the framework of open quantum systems, we show how the origin of these
non-standard time evolutions can be traced to the interaction of the kaon
system with a large environment. We find that D-branes, effectively described
by a heat-bath of quanta obeying infinite statistics, could constitute a
realistic example of such an environment.
