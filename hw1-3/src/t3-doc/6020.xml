Seiberg-Witten Geometry with Various Matter Contents
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the Seiberg-Witten geometry for four-dimensional N=2 gauge theory
with gauge group SO(2N_c) (N_c \leq 5) with massive spinor and vector
hypermultiplets by considering the gauge symmetry breaking in the N=2 $E_6$
theory with massive fundamental hypermultiplets. In a similar way the
Seiberg-Witten geometry is determined for N=2 SU(N_c) (N_c \leq 6) gauge theory
with massive antisymmetric and fundamental hypermultiplets. Whenever possible
we compare our results expressed in the form of ALE fibrations with those
obtained by geometric engineering and brane dynamics, and find a remarkable
agreement. We also show that these results are reproduced by using N=1
confining phase superpotentials.
