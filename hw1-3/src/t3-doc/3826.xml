Three-Dimensional CFTs and RG Flow from Squashing M2-Brane Horizon
</title>

<abstract>
  Utilizing AdS/CFT correspondence in M-theory, an example of interacting d=3
conformal field theories and renormalization group flow between them is
presented. Near-horizon geometry of N coincident M2-branes located on a conical
singularity on eight-dimensional hyperk\"ahler manifold or manifold with
Spin(7) holonomy is, in large-N limit, AdS4*X7, where X7 is seven-sphere with
squashing. Deformation from round $\S_7$ to squashed one is known to lead to
spontaneous breaking of N=8 local supersymmetry in gauged AdS4 supergravity to
N=1, 0. Via AdS/CFT correspondence, it is interpreted as renormalization group
flow from SO(5)*SO(3) symmetric UV fixed point to SO(8) symmetric IR fixed
point. Evidences for the interpretation are found both from supergravity scalar
potential and existence of interpolating static domain-wall thereof, and from
conformal dimensions of relevant chiral primary operator at each fixed point.
