<title>
Topology, Entropy and Witten Index of Dilaton Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We have found that for extreme dilaton black holes an inner boundary must be
introduced in addition to the outer boundary to give an integer value to the
Euler number. The resulting manifolds have (if one identifies imaginary time)
topology $S^1 \times R \times S^2 $ and Euler number $\chi = 0$ in contrast to
the non-extreme case with $\chi=2$. The entropy of extreme $U(1)$ dilaton black
holes is already known to be zero. We include a review of some recent ideas due
to Hawking on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case. By regarding all extreme black
holes as having an inner boundary, we conclude that the entropy of {\sl all}
extreme black holes, including $[U(1)]^2$ black holes, vanishes. We discuss the
relevance of this to the vanishing of quantum corrections and the idea that the
functional integral for extreme holes gives a Witten Index. We have studied
also the topology of ``moduli space'' of multi black holes. The quantum
mechanics on black hole moduli spaces is expected to be supersymmetric despite
the fact that they are not HyperK\"ahler since the corresponding geometry has
torsion unlike the BPS monopole case. Finally, we describe the possibility of
extreme black hole fission for states with an energy gap. The energy released,
as a proportion of the initial rest mass, during the decay of an
electro-magnetic black hole is 300 times greater than that released by the
fission of an ${}^{235} U$ nucleus.
