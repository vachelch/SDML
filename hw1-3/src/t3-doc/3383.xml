Non-Abelian Strong-Weak Coupling Duality in (String-Derived) N=4
  Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study strong-weak coupling duality (S-duality) in N=4 supersymmetric
non-Abelian Yang-Mills theories. These theories arise naturally as the
low-energy limit of four-dimensional toroidal compactifications of the
heterotic string. Firstly, we define the free energy in the presence of
electric and magnetic fluxes using 't Hooft's prescription, i.e. through
functional integrals at finite volume in the presence of twisted boundary
conditions. Then, we compute those free energies in two limiting cases: small
and large coupling constant. Finally, we extend the free-energies to all values
of the coupling constant (and the theta angle) by presenting a fully S-duality
invariant ansatz. This ansatz obeys all relevant consistency conditions; in
particular, it obeys 't Hooft duality equations and Witten's magnetic-electric
transmutation. The existence of an S-duality invariant, consistent definition
of free energies supports the claim made in the literature that S-duality is a
duality symmetry of N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills. Our ansatz also suggests that N=4,
irrespective of whether partially broken or not, is in a self-dual phase: no
phase transitions occur between the strong and weak coupling regimes.
