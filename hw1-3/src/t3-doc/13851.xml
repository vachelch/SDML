<title>
Thermodynamic Curvature of the BTZ Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  Some thermodynamic properties of the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black
hole are studied to get the effective dimension of its corresponding
statistical model. For this purpose, we make use of the geometrical approach to
the thermodynamics: Considering the black hole as a thermodynamic system with
two thermodynamic variables (the mass $M$ and the angular momemtum $J$), we
obtain two-dimensional Riemannian thermodynamic geometry described by positive
definite Ruppeiner metric. From the thermodynamic curvature we find that the
extremal limit is the critical point. The effective spatial dimension of the
statistical system corresponding to the near-extremal BTZ black holes is one.
Far from the extremal point, the effective dimension becomes less than one,
which leads to one possible speculation on the underlying structure for the
corresponding statistical model.
