<title>
Non-perturbative scaling in the scalar theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A new approach to study the scaling behavior of the scalar theory near the
Gaussian fixed point in $d$-dimensions is presented. For a class of initial
data an explicit use of the Green's function of the evolution equation is made.
It is thus discussed under which conditions non-polynomial relevant
interactions can be generated by the renormalization group flow.
