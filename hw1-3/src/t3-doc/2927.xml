<title>
Breathing mode compactifications and supersymmetry of the brane-world
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently been shown that the Randall-Sundrum brane-world may be
obtained from an appropriate doubled D3-brane configuration in type IIB theory.
This corresponds, in five dimensions, to a sphere compactification of the
original IIB theory with a non-trivial breathing mode supporting the brane. In
this paper, we shall study the supersymmetry of this reduction to massive
five-dimensional supergravity, and derive the effective supersymmetry
transformations for the fermionic superpartners to the breathing mode. We also
consider the sphere compactifications of eleven-dimensional supergravity to
both four and seven dimensions. For the compactifications on S^5 and S^7, we
include a squashing mode scalar and discuss the truncation from N=8 to N=2
supersymmetry.
