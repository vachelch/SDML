Matter Coupled AdS_3 Supergravities and Their Black Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We couple n copies of N=(2,0) scalar multiplets to a gauged N=(2,0)
supergravity in 2+1 dimensions which admits AdS_3 as a vacuum. The scalar
fields are charged under the gauged R-symmetry group U(1) and parametrize
certain Kahler manifolds with compact or non-compact isometries. The radii of
these manifolds are quantized in the compact case, but arbitrary otherwise. In
the compact case, we find half-supersymmetry preserving and asymptotically
Minkowskian black string solutions. For a particular value of the scalar
manifold radius, the solution coincides with that of Horne and Horowitz found
in the context of a string theory in 2+1 dimensions. In the non-compact case,
we find half-supersymmetry preserving and asymptotically AdS_3 string solutions
which have naked singularities. We also obtain two distinct AdS_3
supergravities coupled to n copies of N=(1,0) scalar multiplets either by the
truncation of the (2,0) model or by a direct construction.
