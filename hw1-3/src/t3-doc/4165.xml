B.R.S. renormalisation of some on-shell closed algebras of symmetry
  transformations : the example of supersymmetric non-linear sigma models : the
  N=1 case
</title>

<abstract>
  In order to study in a regularisation free manner the renormalisability of
d=2 supersymmetric non-linear $\si$ models, one has to use the algebraic BRS
methods ; moreover, in the absence of an off-shell formulation, one has often
to deal with open algebras. We then recall in a pedagogical and non technical
manner the standard methods used to handle these questions and illustrate them
on N=1 supersymmetric non-linear $\si$ model in component fields, giving the
first rigorous proof of their renormalisability. In the special case of compact
homogeneous manifolds (non-linear $\si$ model on a coset space G/H), we obtain
the supersymmetric extension of the analysis done some years ago in the bosonic
case. A further publication will be devoted to extended supersymmetry.
