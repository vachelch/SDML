Supersymmetry of M-Branes at Angles
</title>

<abstract>
  We determine the possible fractions of supersymmetry preserved by two
intersecting M-5-branes. These include the fractions 3/32 and 5/32 which have
not occurred previously in intersecting brane configurations. Both occur in
non-orthogonal pointlike intersections of M-5-branes but 5/32 supersymmetry is
possible only for specific fixed angles.
