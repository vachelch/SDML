<title>
T-Duality Transformation and Universal Structure of Non-Critical String
  Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a T-duality transformation for the c=1/2 matrix model for the
purpose of studying duality transformations in a possible toy example of
nonperturbative frameworks of string theory. Our approach is to first
investigate the scaling limit of the Schwinger-Dyson equations and the
stochastic Hamiltonian in terms of the dual variables and then compare the
results with those using the original spin variables. It is shown that the
c=1/2 model in the scaling limit is T-duality symmetric in the sphere
approximation. The duality symmetry is however violated when the higher-genus
effects are taken into account, owing to the existence of global Z_2 vector
fields corresponding to nontrivial homology cycles. Some universal properties
of the stochastic Hamiltonians which play an important role in discussing the
scaling limit and have been discussed in a previous work by the last two
authors are refined in both the original and dual formulations. We also report
a number of new explicit results for various amplitudes containing macroscopic
loop operators.
