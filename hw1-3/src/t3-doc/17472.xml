<title>
Canonical quantization of spontaneously broken topologically massive
  gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
In this paper we investigate the canonical quantization of a non-Abelian
topologically massive Chern-Simons theory in which the gauge fields are
minimally coupled to a multiplet of scalar fields in such a way that the gauge
symmetry is spontaneously broken. Such a model produces the Chern-Simons-Higgs
mechanism in which the gauge excitations acquire mass both from the
Chern-Simons term and from the Higgs-Kibble effect. The symmetry breaking is
chosen to be only partially broken, in such a way that in the broken vacuum
there remains a residual non-Abelian symmetry. We develop the canonical
operator structure of this theory in the broken vacuum, with particular
emphasis on the particle-content of the fields involved in the
Chern-Simons-Higgs mechanism. We construct the Fock space and express the
dynamical generators in terms of creation and annihilation operator modes. The
canonical apparatus is used to obtain the propagators for this theory, and we
use the Poincar\'e generators to demonstrate the effect of Lorentz boosts on
the particle states.
