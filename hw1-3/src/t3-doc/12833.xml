<title>
A new analytic approach to physical observables in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  An analytic ghost-free model for the QCD running coupling $\alpha(Q^2)$ is
proposed. It is constructed from a more general approach we developed
particularly for investigating physical observables of the type $F(Q^2)$ in
regions that are inaccessible to perturbative methods of quantum field theory.
This approach directly links the infrared (IR) and the ultraviolet(UV) regions
together under the causal analyticity requirement in the complex $Q^2-$plane.
Due to the inclusion of crucial non-perturbative effects, the running coupling
in our model not only excludes unphysical singularities but also freezes to a
finite value at the IR limit $Q^2=0$. This makes it consistent with a popular
phenomenological hypothesis, namely the IR freezing phenomenon. Applying this
model to compute the Gluon condensate, we obtain a result that is in good
agreement with the most recent phenomenological estimate. Having calculated the
$\beta-$function corresponding to our QCD coupling constant, we find that it
behaves qualitatively like its perturbative counterpart, when calculated beyond
the leading order and with a number of quark flavours allowing for the
occurrence of IR fixed points.
