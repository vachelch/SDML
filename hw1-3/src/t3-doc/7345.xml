<title>
Left-Right Symmetric Model from Geometrical Formulation of Gauge Theory
  in $M_4 \times Z_2 \times Z_2$
</title>

<abstract>
  The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) with gauge group $SU(2)_{L} \times
SU(2)_{R} \times U(1)_{B-L}$ is reconstructed from the geometric formulation of
gauge theory in $M_4 \times Z_2 \times Z_2$ where $M_4$ is the four-dimensional
Minkowski space and $Z_2 \times Z_2$ the discrete space with four points. The
geometrical structure of this model becomes clearer compared with other works
based on noncommutative geometry. As a result, the Yukawa coupling terms and
the Higgs potential are derived in more restricted forms than in the standard
LRSM.
