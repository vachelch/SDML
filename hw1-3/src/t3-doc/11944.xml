Target-space anomalies and elliptic indices in heterotic orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a complete string theory analysis of all mixed gauge,
gravitational and target-space anomalies potentially arising in the simplest
heterotic Z_N orbifold models, with N odd and standard embedding. These
anomalies turn out to be encoded in an elliptic index, which can be easily
computed; they are found to cancel through a universal GS mechanism induced by
the dilaton multiplet. The target-space symmetry is then shown to have a nice
geometric interpretation in terms of torsion, and the target-space dependence
of the four-dimensional GS couplings can be alternatively rederived from the
implicit torsion dependence of the standard ten-dimensional GS couplings. The
result is universal and consists essentially of a Bianchi identity for the NSNS
B field depending on all the curvatures, and in particular on the target-space
curvature.
