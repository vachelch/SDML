<title>
Gauge Fields, Scalars, Warped Geometry, and Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We review results on several interesting phenomena in warped
compactifications of M theory, as presented at Strings 2000. The behavior of
gauge fields in dimensional reduction from $d+1$ to $d$ dimensions in various
backgrounds is explained from the point of view of the holographic duals (and a
point raised in the question session at the conference is addressed). We
summarize the role of additional fields (in particular scalar fields) in 5d
warped geometries in making it possible for Poincare-invariant domain wall
solutions to exist to a nontrivial order in a controlled approximation scheme
without fine-tuning of parameters in the $5d$ action (and comment on the status
of the singularities arising in the general relativistic description of these
solutions). Finally, we discuss briefly the emergence of excitations of wrapped
branes in warped geometries whose effective thickness, as measured along the
Poincare slices in the geometry, grows as the energy increases.
