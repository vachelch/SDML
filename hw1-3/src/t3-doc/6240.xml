Feynman Rules in N=2 Projective Superspace I: Massless hypermultiplets
</title>

<abstract>
  Manifestly N=2 supersymmetric Feynman rules are found for different off-shell
realizations of the massless hypermultiplet in projective superspace. When we
reduce the Feynman rules to an N=1 superspace we obtain the correct component
propagators. The Feynman rules are shown to be compatible with a ``duality''
that acts only on the auxiliary fields, as well as with the usual duality
relating the hypermultiplet to the tensor multiplet.
