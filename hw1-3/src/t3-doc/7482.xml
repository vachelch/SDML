<title>
Hidden algebra of the $N$-body Calogero problem
</title>

<abstract>
  A certain generalization of the algebra $gl(N,{\bf R})$ of first-order
differential operators acting on a space of inhomogeneous polynomials in ${\bf
R}^{N-1}$ is constructed. The generators of this (non)Lie algebra depend on
permutation operators. It is shown that the Hamiltonian of the $N$-body
Calogero model can be represented as a second-order polynomial in the
generators of this algebra. Given representation implies that the Calogero
Hamiltonian possesses infinitely-many, finite-dimensional invariant subspaces
with explicit bases, which are closely related to the finite-dimensional
representations of above algebra. This representation is an alternative to the
standard representation of the Bargmann-Fock type in terms of creation and
annihilation operators.
