<title>
Probing integrable perturbations of conformal theories using singular
  vectors
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been known for some time that the (1,3) perturbations of the (2k+1,2)
Virasoro minimal models have conserved currents which are also singular vectors
of the Virasoro algebra. This also turns out to hold for the (1,2) perturbation
of the (3k+-1,3) models. In this paper we investigate the requirement that a
perturbation of an extended conformal field theory has conserved currents which
are also singular vectors. We consider conformal field theories with W3 and
(bosonic) WBC2 = W(2,4) extended symmetries. Our analysis relies heavily on the
general conjecture of de Vos and van Driel relating the multiplicities of
W-algebra irreducible modules to the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of a certain
double coset. Granting this conjecture, the singular-vector argument provides a
direct way of recovering all known integrable perturbations. However, W models
bring a slight complication in that the conserved densities of some (1,2)-type
perturbations are actually subsingular vectors, that is, they become singular
vectors only in a quotient module.
