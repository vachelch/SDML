Mirage Cosmology in M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the idea of mirage cosmology to M-theory. Considering the motion of
a probe brane in the M-theory background generated by a stack of non-threshold
(M2,M5) bound states, we study the cosmological evolution of the brane universe
in this background. We estimate the range of $r$ where the formalism is valid.
Effective energy density on the probe brane is obtained in terms of the scale
factor. Comparing the limiting case of the result with that from type IIB
background, we confirm that the cosmological evolution by mirage matter is a
possible scenario in the M-theory context.
