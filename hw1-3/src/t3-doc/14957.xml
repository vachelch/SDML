<title>
An explicit construction of Wakimoto realizations of current algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  It is known from a work of Feigin and Frenkel that a Wakimoto type,
generalized free field realization of the current algebra $\widehat{\cal G}_k$
can be associated with each parabolic subalgebra ${\cal P}=({\cal G}_0+{\cal
G}_+)$ of the Lie algebra ${\cal G}$, where in the standard case ${\cal G}_0$
is the Cartan and ${\cal P}$ is the Borel subalgebra. In this letter we obtain
an explicit formula for the Wakimoto realization in the general case. Using
Hamiltonian reduction of the WZNW model, we first derive a Poisson bracket
realization of the ${\cal G}$-valued current in terms of symplectic bosons
belonging to ${\cal G}_+$ and a current belonging to ${\cal G}_0$. We then
quantize the formula by determining the correct normal ordering. We also show
that the affine-Sugawara stress-energy tensor takes the expected quadratic form
in the constituents.
