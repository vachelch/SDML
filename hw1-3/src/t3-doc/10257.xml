<title>
On the construction of corrected Light-Front Hamiltonian for QED_2
</title>

<abstract>
  The counterterms, which must be included into Light-Front Hamiltonian of
$QED_2$ to get the equivalence with conventional Lorentz-covariant formulation,
are found. This is done to all orders of perturbation theory in fermion mass,
using the bosonization at intermediate steps and comparing Light-Front and
Lorentz-covariant perturbation theories for bosonized model. The obtained
Light-Front Hamiltonian contains all terms, present in the $QED_2$ theory,
canonically (naively) quantized on the Light-Front (in the Light-Front gauge)
and an unusual counterterm. This counterterm is proportional to linear
combination of fermion zero modes (which are multiplied by some operator
factors neutralizing their charge and fermionic number). The coefficients
before these zero mode operators are UV finite and depend on condensate
parameter in the $\theta$-vacuum. These coefficients are proportional to
fermion mass, when this mass goes to zero.
