<title>
Convection displacement current and alternative form of Maxwell-Lorentz
  equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Some mathematical inconsistencies in the conventional form of Maxwell's
equations extended by Lorentz for a single charge system are discussed. To
surmount these in framework of Maxwellian theory, a novel convection
displacement current is considered as additional and complementary to the
famous Maxwell displacement current. It is shown that this form of the
Maxwell-Lorentz equations is similar to that proposed by Hertz for
electrodynamics of bodies in motion. Original Maxwell's equations can be
considered as a valid approximation for a continuous and closed (or going to
infinity) conduction current. It is also proved that our novel form of the
Maxwell-Lorentz equations is relativistically invariant. In particular, a
relativistically invariant gauge for quasistatic fields has been found to
replace the non-invariant Coulomb gauge. The new gauge condition contains the
famous relationship between electric and magnetic potentials for one uniformly
moving charge that is usually attributed to the Lorentz transformations.
Thus, for the first time, using the convection displacement current, a physical
interpretation is given to the relationship between the components of the
four-vector of quasistatic potentials. A rigorous application of the new gauge
transformation with the Lorentz gauge transforms the basic field equations into
an independent pair of differential equations responsible for longitudinal and
transverse fields, respectively. The longitudinal components can be interpreted
exclusively from the standpoint of the instantaneous "action at a distance"
concept and leads to necessary conceptual revision of the conventional
Faraday-Maxwell field. The concept of electrodynamic dualism is proposed for
self-consistent classical electrodynamics. It implies simultaneous coexistence
