Topological phase transitions in low-dimensional systems
</title>

<abstract>
  A general theory of the Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type phase
transitions in low-dimensional systems is proposed. It is shown that in
d-dimensional case the necessary conditions for it can take place are 1)
conformal invariance of kinetic part of model action and 2) vacuum homotopy
group $\pi_{d-1}$ must be nontrivial and discrete. It means a discrete vacuum
degeneracy for $1d$ systems and continuous vacuum degeneracy for higher $d$
systems. For such systems topological exitations have logariphmically divergent
energy and they can be described by corresponding effective field theories. In
general case the sufficient conditions for existence of the BKT type phase
transition are 1) constraint $d \le 2$ and 2) $\pi_{d-1}$ must have some
crystallographic symmetries. Critical properties of possible low-dimensional
effective theories are determined and it is shown that in two-dimensional case
they are characterized by the Coxeter numbers $h_G$ of lattices from the series
${A,D,E,Z}$ and can be interpreted as those of conformal field theories with
integer central charge $c=r,$ where $r$ is a rank of groups $\pi_1$ and $G.$ In
one-dimensional case analogous critical properties have ferromagnetic Dyson
chains with discrete Cartan-Ising spins. In contrast, critical properties of
one-dimensional models with periodic potentials have a weak dependence on group
$G.$
