<title>
Doubling of Scattering Phase Shifts for Two Dimensional Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the origin of the leg factors appearing in 2D string theory.
Computing in the world sheet framework we use the semiclassical method to study
string amplitudes at high energy. We show that in the case of a simplest
2-point amplitude these factors correspond entirely to the time delay for
reflection off the Liouville wall. Our semiclassical calculation reveals that
the string longitudinal modes, although nonpropagating in 2D spacetime, have
the effect of doubling the phase shift. Particular emphasis is put on
comparison with the point particle (center of mass) case. A general method is
then given for calculating an arbitrary amplitude semiclassically.
