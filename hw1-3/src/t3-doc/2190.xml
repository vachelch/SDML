String Quantization in Curved Spacetimes: Null String Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We study quantum strings in strong gravitational fields. The relevant small
parameter is $g=R_c{\sqrt T_0}$, where $R_c$ is the curvature of the spacetime
and $T_0$ is the string tension. Within our systematic expansion we obtain to
zeroth order the null string (string with zero tension), while the first order
correction incorporates the string dynamics. We apply our formalism to quantum
null strings in de Sitter spacetime. After a reparametrization of the
world-sheet coordinates, the equations of motion are simplified. The quantum
algebra generated by the constraints is considered, ordering the momentum
operators to the right of the coordinate operators. No critical dimension
appears. It is anticipated however that the conformal anomaly will appear when
the first order corrections proportional to $T_0$, are introduced.
