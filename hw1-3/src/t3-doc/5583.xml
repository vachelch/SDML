D-branes and Fat Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The application of D-brane methods to large black holes whose Schwarzschild
radius is larger than the compactification scale is problematic. Callan and
Maldacena have suggested that despite apparent problems of strong interactions
when the number of branes becomes large, the open string degrees of freedom may
remain very dilute due to the growth of the horizon area which they claim grows
more rapidly than the average number of open strings. Such a picture of a
dilute weakly coupled string system conflicts with the picture of a dense
string-soup that saturates the bound of one string per planck area. A more
careful analysis shows that Callan and Maldacena were not fully consistent in
their estimates. In the form that their model was studied it can not be used to
extrapolate to large mass without being in conflict with the Hawking Bekenstein
entropy formula. A somewhat modified model can reproduce the correct entropy
formula. In this ``improved model" the number of string bits on the horizon
scales like the entropy in agreement with earlier speculations of Susskind.
