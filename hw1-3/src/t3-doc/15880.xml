<title>
Gauss-Bonnet Black Holes in AdS Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We study thermodynamic properties and phase structures of topological black
holes in Einstein theory with a Gauss-Bonnet term and a negative cosmological
constant. The event horizon of these topological black holes can be a
hypersurface with positive, zero or negative constant curvature. When the
horizon is a zero curvature hypersurface, the thermodynamic properties of black
holes are completely the same as those of black holes without the Gauss-Bonnet
term, although the two black hole solutions are quite different. When the
horizon is a negative constant curvature hypersurface, the thermodynamic
properties of the Gauss-Bonnet black holes are qualitatively similar to those
of black holes without the Gauss-Bonnet term. When the event horizon is a
hypersurface with positive constant curvature, we find that the thermodynamic
properties and phase structures of black holes drastically depend on the
spacetime dimension $d$ and the coefficient of the Gauss-Bonnet term: when
$d\ge 6$, the properties of black hole are also qualitatively similar to the
case without the Gauss-Bonnet term, but when $d=5$, a new phase of locally
stable small black hole occurs under a critical value of the Gauss-Bonnet
coefficient, and beyond the critical value, the black holes are always
thermodynamically stable. However, the locally stable small black hole is not
globally preferred, instead a thermal anti-de Sitter space is globally
preferred. We find that there is a minimal horizon radius, below which the
Hawking-Page phase transition will not occur since for these black holes the
thermal anti de Sitter space is always globally preferred.
