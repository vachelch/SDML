<title>
Explicit determination of a 727-dimensional root space of the hyperbolic
  Lie algebra $E_{10}$
</title>

<abstract>
  The 727-dimensional root space associated with the level-2 root $\bLambda_1$
of the hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebra $E_{10}$ is determined using a recently
developed string theoretic approach to hyperbolic algebras. The explicit form
of the basis reveals a complicated structure with transversal as well as
longitudinal string states present.
