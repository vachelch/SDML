Calculation of Graviton Scattering Amplitudes using String-Based Methods
</title>

<abstract>
  Techniques based upon the string organisation of amplitudes may be used to
simplify field theory calculations. We apply these techniques to perturbative
gravity and calculate all one-loop amplitudes for four-graviton scattering with
arbitrary internal particle content. Decomposing the amplitudes into
contributions arising from supersymmetric multiplets greatly simplifies these
calculations. We also discuss how unitarity may be used to constrain the
amplitudes.
