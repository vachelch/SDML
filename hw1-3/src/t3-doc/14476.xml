<title>
Fused Potts Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalizing the mapping between the Potts model with nearest neighbor
interaction and six vertex model, we build a family of "fused Potts models"
related to the spin $k/2$ ${\rm U}_{q}{\rm su}(2)$ invariant vertex model and
quantum spin chain. These Potts model have still variables taking values
$1,\ldots,Q$ ($\sqrt{Q}=q+q^{-1}$) but they have a set of complicated multi
spin interactions. The general technique to compute these interactions, the
resulting lattice geometry, symmetries, and the detailed examples of $k=2,3$
are given. For $Q>4$ spontaneous magnetizations are computed on the integrable
first order phase transition line, generalizing Baxter's results for $k=1$. For
$Q\leq 4$, we discuss the full phase diagram of the spin one ($k=2$)
anisotropic and ${\rm U}_{q}{\rm su}(2)$ invariant quantum spin chain (it
reduces in the limit $Q=4$ ($q=1$) to the much studied phase diagram of the
isotropic spin one quantum chain). Several critical lines and massless phases
are exhibited. The appropriate generalization of the Valence Bond State method
of Affleck et al. is worked out.
