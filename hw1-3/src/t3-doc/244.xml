<title>
Open Inflation, the Four Form and the Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  Fundamental theories of quantum gravity such as supergravity include a four
form field strength which contributes to the cosmological constant. The
inclusion of such a field into our theory of open inflation (hep-th/9802030)
allows an anthropic solution to the cosmological constant problem in which the
cosmological constant gives a small but non-negligible contribution to the
density of today's universe. We include a discussion of the role of the
singularity in our solution and a reply to Vilenkin's recent criticism
(hep-th/9803084).
