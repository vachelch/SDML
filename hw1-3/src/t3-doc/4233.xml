Representations of the quantum matrix algebra $M_{q,p}(2)$
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the finite dimensional irreducible representaions of the
quantum matrix algebra $ M_{ q,p}(2) $ ( the coordinate ring of $ GL_{q,p}(2)
$) exist only when both q and p are roots of unity. In this case th e space of
states has either the topology of a torus or a cylinder which may be thought of
as generalizations of cyclic representations.
