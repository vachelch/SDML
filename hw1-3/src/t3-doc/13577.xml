Microcanonical D-branes and Back Reaction
</title>

<abstract>
  We compare the emission rates from excited D-branes in the microcanonical
ensemble with back reaction corrected emission rates from black holes in field
theory. In both cases, the rates in the high energy tail of the spectrum differ
markedly from what a canonical ensemble or free field theory approach would
yield. Instead of being proportional to a Bose-Einstein distribution function,
the rates in the high energy tail are proportional to $\exp (-\Delta S_{BH})$
where $\Delta S_{BH}$ is the difference in black hole entropies before and
after emission. After including the new effects, we find agreement, at leading
order, between the D-brane and field theory rates over the entire range of the
spectrum.
