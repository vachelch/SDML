Strings as Physical Lines in Vacuum: Basic Concepts for the Computation
  of the Planck Length and the Planck Mass
</title>

<abstract>
  Certain linear objects, termed physical lines, are considered, and initial
assumptions concerning their properties are introduced. A closed physical line
in the form of a circle, termed J-string, is singled out for investigation. It
is shown that this curve consists of indivisible line segments of length
$\ell_\Delta$. It is assumed that a J-string has an angular momentum whose
value is $\hbar$.It is then established that a J-string of radius $R$ possesses
a mass $m_J$, equal to $h/2\pi c R$, a corresponding energy, as well as a
charge $q_J$, where $q_J = (hc/2\pi)^{1/2}$. It is also established that
$\ell_\Delta = 2\pi(hG/c^3)^{1/2}$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $G$ is
the gravitational constant. % Based upon investigation of the properties and
characteristics of J-strings, a method is developed for the computation of the
Planck length and mass $(\ell^*_P, m^*_P)$. The values of $\ell^*_P$ and
$m^*_P$ are computed according to the resulting formulae (and given in the
paper); these values differ from the currently accepted ones.
