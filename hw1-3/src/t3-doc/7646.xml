Infinity Cancellation, Type I' Compactification and String S-Matrix
  Functional
</title>

<abstract>
  Nonvanishing tadpoles and possible infinities associated in the multiparticle
amplitudes are discussed with regard to the disk and $RP^{2}$ diagrams of the
Type I' compactification. We find that the infinity cancellation of $SO(32)$
type $I$ theory extends to this case as well despite the presence of tadpoles
localized in the D-brane world-volume and the orientifold surfaces. Formalism
of string S-matrix generating functional is presented to find a consistent
string background as c-number source function: we find this only treats the
cancellation of the tadpoles in the linearized approximation. Our formalism
automatically provides representation of the string amplitudes on this
background to all orders in $\alpha'$.
