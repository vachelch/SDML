Free energy of N=4 super Yang-Mills in Higgs phase and non-extremal
  D3-brane interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the free energy of \N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in the Higgs phase
with a mass scale M corresponding to non-zero v.e.v. of the scalar fields. At
zero temperature this theory describes a system of parallel separated extremal
D3-branes. Non-zero temperature corresponds to non-extremality in supergravity
description. We interpret the supergravity interaction potential between a
non-extremal D3-brane and a D3-brane probe as contribution of massive states to
the free energy of N --> infinity SYM theory at strong 't Hooft coupling (N
g^2_{YM} >> 1). Both low (M >> T) and high (T >> M) temperature regimes are
considered. For low temperature we find that the structure of terms that appear
in the free energy at strong and weak coupling is the same. The analysis of the
high-temperature regime depends on a careful identification of the scalar field
v.e.v. in terms of the distance between branes in the supergravity description
and again predicts strong coupling terms similar to those found in the
weak-coupling \N=4 SYM theory. We consider also the corrections to the strong
coupling results by taking into account the leading \a'^3 R^4 string
contribution to the supergravity effective action. This gives rise to the (N
g^2_{YM})^{-3/2} corrections in the coefficient functions of 't Hooft coupling
which multiply different terms in free energy.
