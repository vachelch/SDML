<title>
Towards the Construction of Wightman Functions of Integrable Quantum
  Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The purpose of the ``bootstrap program'' for integrable quantum field
theories in 1+1 dimensions is to construct a model in terms of its Wightman
functions explicitly. In this article, this program is mainly illustrated in
terms of the sine-Gordon and the sinh-Gordon model and (as an exercise) the
scaling Ising model. We review some previous results on sine-Gordon breather
form factors and quantum operator equations. The problem to sum over
intermediate states is attacked in the short distance limit of the two point
Wightman function for the sinh-Gordon and the scaling Ising model.
