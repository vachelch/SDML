<title>
Completeness of ``Good'' Bethe Ansatz Solutions of a Quantum Group
  Invariant Heisenberg Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The $sl_q(2)$-quantum group invariant spin 1/2 XXZ-Heisenberg model with open
boundary conditions is investigated by means of the Bethe ansatz. As is well
known, quantum groups for $q$ equal to a root of unity possess a finite number
of ``good'' representations with non-zero q-dimension and ``bad'' ones with
vanishing q-dimension.  Correspondingly, the state space of an invariant
Heisenberg chain decomposes into ``good'' and ``bad'' states. A ``good'' state
may be described by a path of only ``good'' representations. It is shown that
the ``good'' states are given by all ``good'' Bethe ansatz solutions with roots
restricted to the first periodicity strip, i.e.  only positive parity strings
(in the language of Takahashi) are allowed. Applying Bethe's string counting
technique completeness of the ``good'' Bethe states is proven, i.e. the same
number of states is found as the number of all restricted path's on the
$sl_q(2)$-Bratteli diagram. It is the first time that a ``completeness" proof
for an anisotropic quantum invariant reduced Heisenberg model is performed.
