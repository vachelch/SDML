<title>
The longitudinal fivebrane and tachyon condensation in matrix theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a configuration in matrix theory carying longitudinal fivebrane
charge, i.e. a D0-D4 bound state. We calculate the one-loop effective potential
between a D0-D4 bound state and a D0-anti-D4 bound state and compare our
results to a supergravity calculation. Next, we identify the tachyonic
fluctuations in the D0-D4 and D0-anti-D4 system. We analyse classically the
action for these tachyons and find solutions to the equations of motion
corresponding to tachyon condensation.
