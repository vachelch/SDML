Holographic Formulation of Quantum Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity with a cosmological constant can be
expressed as constrained topological field theory based on the supergroup
$Osp(1|4)$. The theory is then extended to include timelike boundaries with
finite spatial area. Consistent boundary conditions are found which induce a
boundary theory based on a supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory. The boundary
state space is constructed from states of the boundary supersymmetric
Chern-Simons theory on the punctured two sphere and naturally satisfies the
Bekenstein bound, where area is measured by the area operator of quantum
supergravity.
