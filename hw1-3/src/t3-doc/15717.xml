<title>
Structural aspects of the fermion-boson mapping in two-dimensional gauge
  and anomalous gauge theories with massive fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a synthesis of the functional integral and operator approaches we
discuss the fermion-boson mapping and the role played by the Bose field algebra
in the Hilbert space of two-dimensional gauge and anomalous gauge field
theories with massive fermions. In the $QED_2$ with quartic self-interaction
among massive fermions, the use of an auxiliary vector field introduces a
redundant Bose field algebra that should not be considered as an element of the
intrinsic algebraic structure defining the model. In the anomalous chiral
$QED_2$ with massive fermions the effect of the chiral anomaly leads to the
appearance in the mass operator of a spurious Bose field combination. This
phase factor carries no fermion selection rule and the expected absence of
$\theta$-vacuum in the anomalous model is displayed from the operator solution.
Even in the anomalous model with massive Fermi fields, the introduction of the
Wess-Zumino field replicates the theory, changing neither its algebraic content
nor its physical content.
