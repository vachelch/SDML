<title>
QCD and Strings in 2D
</title>

<abstract>
  In two dimensions large N QCD with quarks, defined on the plane, is
equivalent to a modified string theory with quarks at the ends and taken in the
zero fold sector. The equivalence that was established in 1975 was expressed in
the form of an interacting string action that reproduces the spectrum and the
1/N interactions of 2D QCD. This action may be a starting point for an analytic
continuation to a four dimensional string version of QCD. After reviewing the
old work I discuss relations to recent developments in the pure QCD-string
equivalence on more complicated background %geometries.
