New Type IIB Vacua and their F-Theory Interpretation
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a D3-D7 system in type IIB string theory. The near-horizon
geometry is described by AdS^5 x X^5 where X^5 is a U(1) bundle over a
Kahler-Einstein complex surface S with positive first Chern class c_1>0. The
surface S can either be P^1 x P^1, P^2 or P_{n_1,...,n_k}, a blow up of P^2 at
k points with 3\leq k\leq 8. The P^2 corresponds to the maximally
supersymmetric AdS^5 x S^5 vacuum while the other cases lead to vacua with less
supersymmetries. In the F-theory context they can be viewed as
compactifications on elliptically fibered almost Fano 3-folds.
