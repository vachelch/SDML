Harmonic Gauss Maps and Self-Dual Equations in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The string world sheet, regarded as Riemann surface, in background $R^3$ and
$R^4$ is described by the generalised Gauss map. When the Gauss map is harmonic
or equivalently for surfaces of constant mean scalar curvature, we obtain an
Abelian self-dual system, using $SO(3)$ and $SO(4)$ gauge fields constructed in
our earlier studies. This compliments our earlier result that $h\surd g\ =\ 1$
surfaces exhibit Virasaro symmetry. The self-dual system so obtained is
compared with self-dual Chern-Simons system and a generalized Liouville
equation involving extrinsic geometry is obtained. \vspace{0.2cm} The world
sheet in background $R^n, \ n>4$ is described by the generalized Gauss map. It
is first shown that when the Gauss map is harmonic, the scalar mean curvature
is constant. $SO(n)$ gauge fields are constructed from the geometry of the
surface and expressed in terms of the Gauss map. It is shown that the harmonic
map satisfies a non-Abelian self-dual system of equations for the gauge group
$SO(2)\times SO(n-2)$.
