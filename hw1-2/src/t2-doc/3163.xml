Metafluid dynamics as a gauge field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, the analog of Maxwell electromagnetism for hydrodynamic
turbulence, the metafluid dynamics, is extended in order to reformulate the
metafluid dynamics as a gauge field theory. That analogy opens up the
possibility to investigate this theory as a constrained system. Having this
possibility in mind, we propose a Lagrangian to describe this new theory of
turbulence and, subsequently, analyze it from the symplectic point of view.
  From this analysis, a hidden gauge symmetry is revealed, providing a clear
interpretation and meaning of the physics behind the metafluid theory. Further,
the geometrical interpretation to the gauge symmetries is discussed and the
spectrum for 3D turbulence computed.
