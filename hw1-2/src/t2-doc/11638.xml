A solvable twisted one-plaquette model
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve a hot twisted Eguchi-Kawai model with only timelike plaquettes in
the deconfined phase, by computing the quadratic quantum fluctuations around
the classical vacuum. The solution of the model has some novel features: the
eigenvalues of the time-like link variable are separated in L bunches, if L is
the number of links of the original lattice in the time direction, and each
bunch obeys a Wigner semicircular distribution of eigenvalues. This solution
becomes unstable at a critical value of the coupling constant, where it is
argued that a condensation of classical solutions takes place. This can be
inferred by comparison with the heat-kernel model in the hamiltonian limit, and
the related Douglas-Kazakov phase transition in QCD2. As a byproduct of our
solution, we can reproduce the dependence of the coupling constant from the
parameter describing the asymmetry of the lattice, in agreement with previous
results by Karsch.
