Energy, Central Charge, and the BPS Bound for 1+1 Dimensional
  Supersymmetric Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider one-loop quantum corrections to soliton energies and central
charges in the supersymmetric $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon models in 1+1
dimensions. In both models, we unambiguously calculate the correction to the
energy in a simple renormalization scheme and obtain $\Delta H = - m/(2\pi)$,
in agreement with previous results. Furthermore, we show that there is an
identical correction to the central charge, so that the BPS bound remains
saturated in the one-loop approximation. We extend these results to arbitrary
1+1 dimensional supersymmetric theories.
