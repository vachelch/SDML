Quantum and super-quantum group related to the Alexander-Conway
  polynomial
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the quasitriangular structure (universal $R$-matrix) on the
non-standard quantum group $U_q(H_1,H_2,X^\pm)$ associated to the
Alexander-Conway matrix solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. We show that this
Hopf algebra is connected with the super-Hopf algebra $U_qgl(1|1)$ by a general
process of superization.
