Wormhole and Hawking Radiation
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown in a variant of two dimensional dilaton gravity theories that an
arbitrary, localized massive source put in an initially regular spacetime gives
rise to formation of the wormhole classically, without accompanying the
curvature singularity. The semiclassical quantum correction under this wormhole
spacetime yields Hawking radiation. It is expected, with the quantum back
reaction added to the classical equation, that the information loss paradox may
be resolved in this model.
