Toric Duality as Seiberg Duality and Brane Diamonds
</title>

<abstract>
  We use field theory and brane diamond techniques to demonstrate that Toric
Duality is Seiberg duality for N=1 theories with toric moduli spaces. This
resolves the puzzle concerning the physical meaning of Toric Duality as
proposed in our earlier work. Furthermore, using this strong connection we
arrive at three new phases which can not be thus far obtained by the so-called
``Inverse Algorithm'' applied to partial resolution of C^3/Z_3 x Z_3. The
standing proposals of Seiberg duality as diamond duality in the work by
Aganagic-Karch-L\"ust-Miemiec are strongly supported and new diamond
configurations for these singularities are obtained as a byproduct. We also
make some remarks about the relationships between Seiberg duality and
Picard-Lefschetz monodromy.
