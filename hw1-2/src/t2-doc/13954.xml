Exact Superpotentials from Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Dijkgraaf and Vafa (DV) have conjectured that the exact superpotential for a
large class of N=1 SUSY gauge theories can be extracted from the planar limit
of a certain holomorphic matrix integral. We test their proposal against
existing knowledge for a family of deformations of N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills theory
involving an arbitrary polynomial superpotential for one of the three adjoint
chiral superfields. Specifically, we compare the DV prediction for these models
with earlier results based on the connection between SUSY gauge theories and
integrable systems. We find complete agreement between the two approaches. In
particular we show how the DV proposal allows the extraction of the exact
eigenvalues of the adjoint scalar in the confining vacuum and hence computes
all related condensates of the finite-N gauge theory. We extend these results
to include Leigh-Strassler deformations of the N=4 theory.
