Quantum Field Theory and Representation Theory: A Sketch
</title>

<abstract>
  A sketch is given of a circle of ideas relating quantum field theories with
representation theory. The main mathematical ingredients are spinor geometry
and the gauge group equivariant K-theory of the space of connections.
