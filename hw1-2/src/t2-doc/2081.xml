Calogero-Moser Models IV: Limits to Toda theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Calogero-Moser models and Toda models are well-known integrable
multi-particle dynamical systems based on root systems associated with Lie
algebras. The relation between these two types of integrable models is
investigated at the levels of the Hamiltonians and the Lax pairs. The Lax pairs
of Calogero-Moser models are specified by the representations of the
reflection groups, which are not the same as those of the corresponding Lie
algebras. The latter specify the Lax pairs of Toda models. The Hamiltonians of
the elliptic Calogero-Moser models tend to those of Toda models as one of the
periods of the elliptic function goes to infinity, provided the dynamical
variables are properly shifted and the coupling constants are scaled. On the
other hand most of Calogero-Moser Lax pairs, for example, the root type Lax
pairs, do not a have consistent Toda model limit. The minimal type Lax pairs,
which corresponds to the minimal representations of the Lie algebras, tend to
the Lax pairs of the corresponding Toda models.
