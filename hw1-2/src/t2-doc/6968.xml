The Emergence of Radiation from Gravitational Potential Wells: The
  Absence of $\omega M$ Effects
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a source of gravitational waves of frequency $\omega$, located
near the center of a massive galaxy of mass $M$ and radius $R$, with $\omega\gg
R^{-1}$. In the case of a perfect fluid galaxy, and of odd-parity waves, there
is no direct matter-wave interaction and the propagation of the waves is
affected by the galaxy only through the curvature of the spacetime background
through which the waves propagate. We find that, in addition to the expected
redshift of the radiation emerging from the galaxy, there is a small amount of
backscatter, of order $M/\omega^2R^3$. We show that there is no suppression of
radiative power by the factor $1+\omega^2M^2/4$ as has been recently predicted
by Kundu. The origin of Kundu's suppression lies in the interpretation of a
term in the expansion of the exterior field of the galaxy in inverse powers of
radius. It is shown why that term is not related to the source strength or to
the strength of the emerging radiation.
