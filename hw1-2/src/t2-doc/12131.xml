Thirring Model as a Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We reformulate the Thirring model in $D$ $(2 \le D < 4)$ dimensions as a
gauge theory by introducing $U(1)$ hidden local symmetry (HLS) and study the
dynamical mass generation of the fermion through the Schwinger-Dyson (SD)
equation. By virtue of such a gauge symmetry we can greatly simplify the
analysis of the SD equation by taking the most appropriate gauge (``nonlocal
gauge'') for the HLS.
  In the case of even-number of (2-component) fermions, we find the dynamical
fermion mass generation as the second order phase transition at certain fermion
number, which breaks the chiral symmetry but preserves the parity in (2+1)
dimensions ($D=3$). In the infinite four-fermion coupling (massless gauge
boson) limit in (2+1) dimensions, the result coincides with that of the
(2+1)-dimensional QED, with the critical number of the 4-component fermion
being $N_{\rm cr} = \frac{128}{3\pi^{2}}$. As to the case of odd-number
(2-component) fermion in (2+1) dimensions, the regularization ambiguity on the
induced Chern-Simons term may be resolved by specifying the regularization so
as to preserve the HLS.
  Our method also applies to the (1+1) dimensions, the result being consistent
with the exact solution. The bosonization mechanism in (1+1) dimensional
Thirring model is also reproduced in the context of dual-transformed theory for
the HLS.
