Integrable aspects of the scaling q-state Potts models I: bound states
  and bootstrap closure
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the q-state Potts models for q<=4, in the scaling regimes close to
their critical or tricritical points. Starting from the kink S-matrix elements
proposed by Chim and Zamolodchikov, the bootstrap is closed for the scaling
regions of all critical points, and for the tricritical points when 4>q>=2. We
also note a curious appearance of the extended last line of Freudenthal's magic
square in connection with the Potts models.
