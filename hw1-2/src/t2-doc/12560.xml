Reduction of open membrane moduli
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a general reduction of the open membrane metric in a worldvolume
direction of the M5-brane. Using reduction rules analogous to the bulk, we show
that the open membrane metric leads to the standard open string metric and open
string coupling constant on the D4-brane only for an ``electric'' reduction in
which case the open membrane metric has no off-diagonal components and the
Born-Infeld curvature tensor is a matrix of rank 2. Instead, if we perform a
general reduction, with nonzero off-diagonal components of the open membrane
metric, we obtain a rank 4 Born-Infeld tensor corresponding to a bound state of
an open string with an open D2--brane. Next, we identify and reduce a 3-form
open membrane ``noncommutativity'' tensor on the M5-brane. This open membrane
parameter only reduces to the open string noncommutativity tensor on the
D4-brane provided we constrain ourselves to an ``electric'' or a ``magnetic''
reduction.
