The branch process of the cosmic strings

<abstract>
  In the light of $\phi$-mapping method and the topological tensor current
theory, the topological structure and the topological quantization of
topological defects are obtained under the condition that Jacobian
$J(\phi/v)\neq0$. When $J(\phi/v)=0$, it is shown that there exists the crucial
case of branch process. Based on the implicit function theorem and the Taylor
expansion, the generation, annihilation and bifurcation of the linear defects
are detailed in the neighborhoods of the limit points and bifurcation points of
$\phi$-mapping, respectively.
