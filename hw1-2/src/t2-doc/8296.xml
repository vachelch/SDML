A class of nonlinear wave equations containing the continuous Toda case
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a nonlinear field equation which can be derived from a binomial
lattice as a continuous limit. This equation, containing a perturbative
friction-like term and a free parameter $\gamma$, reproduces the Toda case (in
absence of the friction-like term) and other equations of physical interest, by
choosing particular values of $\gamma$. We apply the symmetry and the
approximate symmetry approach, and the prolongation technique. Our main purpose
is to check the limits of validity of different analytical methods in the study
of nonlinear field equations. We show that the equation under investigation
with the friction-like term is characterized by a finite-dimensional Lie
algebra admitting a realization in terms of boson annhilation and creation
operators. In absence of the friction-like term, the equation is linearized and
connected with equations of the Bessel type. Examples of exact solutions are
displayed, and the algebraic structure of the equation is discussed.
