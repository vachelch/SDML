Conformal Symmetry and A New Gauge in the Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the background gauge in the Matrix model to propose a new gauge
which is useful for discussing the conformal symmetry. In this gauge, the
special conformal transformation (SCT) as the isometry of the near-horizon
geometry of the D-particle solution is directly reproduced with the correct
coefficient as the quantum correction to the SCT in the Matrix model. We also
present a general argument for the relation between the gauge choice and the
field redefinition in the Matrix model.
