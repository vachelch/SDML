N_T=4 equivariant extension of the 3D topological model of Blau and
  Thompson
</title>

<abstract>
  The Blau-Thompson N_T=2, D=3 nonequivariant topological model is extended to
a N_T=4, D=3 topological theory. The latter, formally, may be regarded as a
topological deformation of the N_T=2, D=4 Yamrom-Vafa-Witten theory after
dimensional reduction to D=3. For completeness, also the dimensional reduction
of the half-twisted N_T=2, D=4 Yamron model is explicitly constructed.
