Propagating waves in an extremal black string
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the black string in the context of the string theories. It is
shown that the graviton is the only propagating mode in the (2+1)--dimensional
extremal black string background. Both the dilation and axion turn out to be
non-propagating modes.
