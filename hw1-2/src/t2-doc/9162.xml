Further Evidence for the Conformal Structure of a Schwarzschild Black
  Hole in an Algebraic Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the excitations of a massive Schwarzschild black hole of mass M
resulting from the capture of infalling matter described by a massless scalar
field. The near-horizon dynamics of this system is governed by a Hamiltonian
which is related to the Virasoro algebra and admits a one-parameter family of
self-adjoint extensions described by a parameter z \in R . The density of
states of the black hole can be expressed equivalently in terms of z or M,
leading to a consistent relation between these two parameters. The
corresponding black hole entropy is obtained as S = S(0) - 3/2 log S(0) + C,
where S(0) is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, C is a constant with other
subleading corrections exponentially suppressed. The appearance of this precise
form of the black hole entropy within our formalism, which is expected on
general grounds in any conformal field theoretic description, provides strong
evidence for the near-horizon conformal structure in this system.
