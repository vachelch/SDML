Super Gravitons Interacting with the Super Virasoro Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe actions that correspond to the interaction of the Super Virasoro
algebra with supergravitons. These new field theories introduce a superfield
that corresponds to dual elements of the super Virasoro algebra. We are also
able to extend the definition of these field theories to higher dimensions. We
explicitly exhibit the 2, 3 and 4 dimensional cases. Remarkably, the
fundamental prepotentials describing these dual elements of the super Virasoro
algebra, in each model, agrees with the known prepotentials of the
corresponding supergravity theory. These theories might be important in the
quantization of the super Virasoro group, supergravity and in AdS and super AdS
gravity.
