Homotopic Classification of Yang-Mills Vacua Taking into Account
  Causality
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we study the existence of theta-vacuum states in Yang-Mills
theories defined over asymptotically flat, stationary space-times taking into
account not only the topology but the complicated causal structure of these
space-times, too. By a result of Chrusciel and Wald, apparently causality makes
all vacuum states, seen by a distant observer, homotopically equivalent making
the introduction of theta-terms unnecessary in (causally) effective
Lagrangians.
  But a more careful study shows that certain twisted classical vacuum states
survive even in this case eventually leading to the conclusion that the concept
of ``theta-vacua'' is meaningful in the case of general Yang-Mills theories. We
give a classification of these vacuum states based on Isham's results showing
that the Yang-Mills vacuum has the same complexity as in the flat Minkowskian
case hence the general CP-problem is not more complicated than the well-known
flat one.
