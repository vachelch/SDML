Wess-Zumino-Witten model off criticality
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the renormalization group flow properties of the Wess-Zumino-Witten
model in the region of couplings between $g^2=0$ and $g^2=4\pi/k$, by
evaluating the two-loop Zamolodchikov's $c$-function. We also discuss the
region of negative couplings.
