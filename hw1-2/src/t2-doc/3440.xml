Kac-Moody Algebras and String Theory (THESIS)
</title>

<abstract>
  The focus of this thesis is on (1) the role of Ka\v c-Moody (KM) algebras in
string theory and the development of techniques for systematically building
string theory models based on higher level ($K\geq 2$) KM algebras and (2)
fractional superstrings. In chapter two we review KM algebras and their role in
string theory. In the next chapter, we present two results concerning the
construction of modular invariant partition functions for conformal field
theories built by tensoring together other conformal field theories. First we
show how the possible modular invariants for the tensor product theory are
constrained if the allowed modular invariants of the individual conformal field
theory factors have been classified. We illustrate the use of these constraints
for theories of the type $SU(2)_{K_A}xSU(2)_{K_B}$, finding all consistent
theories for $K_A$ and $K_B$ odd. Second we show how known diagonal modular
invariants can be used to construct inherently asymmetric invariants where the
holomorphic and anti- holomorphic theories do not share the same chiral
algebra. Explicit examples are given. Next, in chapter four we investigate some
issues relating to proposed fractional superstring theories with $D_{\rm
critical}<10$. Using the factorization approach of Gepner and Qiu, we
systematically rederive the partition functions of the $K=4,\, 8,$ and $16$
theories and examine their spacetime supersymmetry. Generalized GSO projection
operators for the $K=4$ model are found. Uniqueness of the twist field,
$\phi^{K/4}_{K/4}$, as source of spacetime fermions, is demonstrated.
