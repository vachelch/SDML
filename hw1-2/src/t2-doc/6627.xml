Quantization of spherically symmetric solution of SU(3) Yang-Mills
  theory

<abstract>
  A recent investigation of the SU(3) Yang-Mills field equations found several
classical solutions which exhibited a type of confinement due to gauge fields
which increased without bound as $r \to \infty$. This increase of the gauge
fields gave these solutions an infinite field energy, raising questions about
their physical significance. In this paper we apply some ideas of Heisenberg
about the quantization of strongly interacting, non-linear fields to this
classical solution and find that at large $r$ this quantization procedure
softens the unphysical behaviour of the classical solution, while the
interesting short distance behaviour is still maintained. This quantization
procedure may provide a general method for approximating the quantum
corrections to certain classical field configurations.
