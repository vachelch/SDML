Clifford algebra as quantum language
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest Clifford algebra as a useful simplifying language for present
quantum dynamics. Clifford algebras arise from representations of the
permutation groups as they arise from representations of the rotation groups.
Aggregates using such representations for their permutations obey Clifford
statistics. The vectors supporting the Clifford algebras of permutations and
rotations are plexors and spinors respectively. Physical spinors may actually
be plexors describing quantum ensembles, not simple individuals. We use
Clifford statistics to define quantum fields on a quantum space-time, and to
formulate a quantum dynamics-field-space-time unity that evades the
compactification problem. The quantum bits of history regarded as a quantum
computation seem to obey a Clifford statistics.
