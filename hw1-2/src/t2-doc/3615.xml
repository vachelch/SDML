An Sl(3,R) multiplet of 8-dimensional type II supergravity theories and
  the gauged supergravity inside

<abstract>
  The so-called ``massive 11-dimensional supergravity'' theory gives, for one
Killing vector, Romans' massive 10-dimensional supergravity in 10 dimensions,
for two Killing vectors an Sl(2,Z) multiplet of massive 9-dimensional
supergravity theories that can be obtained by standard generalized dimensional
reduction type IIB supergravity and has been shown to contain a gauged
supergravity. We consider a straightforward generalization of this theory to
three Killing vectors and a 3\times 3 symmetric mass matrix and show that it
gives an Sl(3,Z) multiplet of 8-dimensional supergravity theories that contain
an SO(3) gauged supergravity which is, in some way, the dual to the one found
by Salam and Sezgin by standard generalized dimensional reduction.
