Current correlators in the Coulomb branch of N=4 SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  We study correlators of R-symmetry currents in the Coulomb branch of N = 4
supersymmetric gauge theory in the large-N limit, using the AdS/CFT
correspondence. In particular, we consider gauge fields in the presence of
gravity and scalar fields parameterizing the coset SL(6,R)/SO(6) in the context
of five-dimensional gauged supergravity. From a ten-dimensional point of view
these backgrounds correspond to continuous D3-brane distributions. We find the
surprising result that all 2-point functions of gauge currents fall into the
same universality class, irrespectively of whether they correspond to broken or
unbroken symmetries. We show that the problem of finding the spectrum can be
mapped into an equivalent Schroedinger problem for supersymmetric quantum
mechanics. The corresponding potential is the supersymmetric partner of the
potential arising in studies of the spectrum for massless scalars and
transverse graviton fluctuations in these backgrounds and the associated
spectra are also identical. We discuss in detail two examples where these
computations can be done explicitly as in the conformal case.
