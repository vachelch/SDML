The Refined Elliptic Genus and Coulomb Gas Formulations of $N=2$
  Superconformal Coset Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe, in some detail, a number of different Coulomb gas formulations
of $N=2$ superconformal coset models. We also give the mappings between these
formulations. The ultimate purpose of this is to show how the Landau-Ginzburg
structure of these models can be used to extract the $W$-generators, and to
show how the computation of the elliptic genus can be refined so as to extract
very detailed information about the characters of component parts of the model.
