Domain Wall Lattices
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct lattices with alternating kinks and anti-kinks. The lattice is
shown to be stable in certain models. We consider the forces between kinks and
antikinks and find that the lattice dynamics is that of a Toda lattice. Such
lattices are exotic metastable states in which the system can get trapped
during a phase transition.
