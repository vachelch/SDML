A Note on the Geometry of CHL Heterotic Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a few remarks on disconnected components of the moduli space of
heterotic string compactifications on $T_2$. We show in particular how the
eight dimensional CHL heterotic string can be understood in terms of
topologically non-trivial $E_8\times E_8$ and $\Spin(32)/Z_2$ vector bundles
over the torus, and that the respective moduli spaces coincide.
