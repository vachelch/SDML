Remarks on Noncommutative Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  In the first part of this work we consider an unstable non-BPS
Dp-\bar{Dp}-brane pair in Type II superstring theory. Turning on a background
NS-NS B-field (constant and nonzero along two spatial directions), we show that
the tachyon responsible for the unstability has a complex GMS solitonic
solution, which is interpreted as the low energy remnant of the resulting
D(p-2)-brane. In the second part, we apply these results to construct the
noncommutative soliton analogous of Witten's superconducting string. This is
done by considering the complex GMS soliton arising from the D3-\bar{D3}-brane
annihilation in Type IIB superstring theory. In the presence of left-handed
fermions, we apply the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal correspondence and the bosonization
technique to show that this object behaves like a superconducting wire.
