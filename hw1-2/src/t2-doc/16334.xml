Gauging of Nonlinearly Realized Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  A representation of a subgroup H of a finite-dimensional group G can be used
to induce a nonlinear realization of G. If the nonlinearly realized symmetry is
gauged, then the BRST charge can be related by a similarity transformation to
the BRST charge for the gauged linear realization of H (plus a cohomologically
trivial piece). It is shown that the relation between the two BRST charges is a
reflection of the fact that they can be interpreted geometrically as
expressions for the exterior derivative on G relative to two different bases,
and an explicit expression for the generator of the similarity transformation
is obtained. This result is applied in an infinite-dimensional setting, where
it yields the similarity transformation used by Ishikawa and Kato to prove the
equivalence of the Berkovits-Vafa superstring with the underlying bosonic
string theory.
