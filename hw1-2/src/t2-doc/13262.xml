O(3) Non-linear $\sigma$ model with Hopf term and Higher spin theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Following our earlier work we argue in detail for the equivalence of the
nonlinear $\sigma$ model with Hopf term at~$\theta=\pi/2s$ ~and an interacting
spin-s theory. We give an ansatz for spin-s operators in the $\sigma$ model and
show the equivalence of the correlation functions.We also show the relation
between topological and Noether currents. We obtain the Lorentz and discrete
transformation properties of the spin-s operator from the fields of the
$\sigma$ model. We also explore the connection of this model with Quantum Hall
Fluids.
