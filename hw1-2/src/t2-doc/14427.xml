Topological Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce the notion of a topological symmetry as a quantum mechanical
symmetry involving a certain topological invariant. We obtain the underlying
algebraic structure of the Z_2-graded uniform topological symmetries of type
(1,1) and (2,1). This leads to a novel derivation of the algebras of
supersymmetry and $p=2$ parasupersummetry.
