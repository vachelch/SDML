On the Geometry of Moduli Space of Vacua in N=2 Supersymmetric
  Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider generic properties of the moduli space of vacua in $N=2$
supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory recently studied by Seiberg and Witten. We
find, on general grounds, Picard--Fuchs type of differential equations
expressing the existence of a flat holomorphic connection, which for one
parameter (i.e. for gauge group $G=SU(2)$), are second order equations. In the
case of coupling to gravity (as in string theory), where also ``gravitational''
electric and magnetic monopoles are present, the electric--magnetic S duality,
due to quantum corrections, does not seem any longer to be related to
$Sl(2,\IZ)$ as for $N=4$ supersymmetric theory.
