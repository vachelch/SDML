Confinement and Strings in MQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We study aspects of confinement in the M theory fivebrane version of QCD
(MQCD). We show heavy quarks are confined in hadrons (which take the form of
membrane-fivebrane bound states) for N=1 and softly broken N=2 SU(Nc) MQCD. We
explore and clarify the transition from the exotic physics of the latter to the
standard physics of the former. In particular, the many strings and
quark-antiquark mesons found in N=2 field theory by Douglas and Shenker are
reproduced. It is seen that in the N=1 limit all but one such meson disappears
while all of the strings survive. The strings of softly broken N=2, N=1, and
even non-supersymmetric SU(Nc) MQCD have a common ratio for their tensions as a
function of the amount of flux they carry. We also comment on the almost BPS
properties of the Douglas-Shenker strings and discuss the brane picture for
monopole confinement on N=2 QCD Higgs branches.
