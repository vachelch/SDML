Gauge Theoretical Construction of Non-compact Calabi-Yau Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds interpreted as the complex
line bundles over the Hermitian symmetric spaces. These manifolds are the
various generalizations of the complex line bundle over CP^{N-1}. Imposing an
F-term constraint on the line bundle over CP^{N-1}, we obtain the line bundle
over the complex quadric surface Q^{N-2}. On the other hand, when we promote
the U(1) gauge symmetry in CP^{N-1} to the non-abelian gauge group U(M), the
line bundle over the Grassmann manifold is obtained. We construct the
non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds with isometries of exceptional groups, which
we have not discussed in the previous papers. Each of these manifolds contains
the resolution parameter which controls the size of the base manifold, and the
conical singularity appears when the parameter vanishes.
