Commuting charges and symmetric spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Every classical sigma-model with target space a compact symmetric space $G/H$
(with $G$ classical) is shown to possess infinitely many local, commuting,
conserved charges which can be written in closed form. The spins of these
charges run over a characteristic set of values, playing the role of exponents
of $G/H$, and repeating modulo an integer $h$ which plays the role of a Coxeter
number.
