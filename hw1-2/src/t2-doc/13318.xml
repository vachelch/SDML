Number of Generations in Free Fermionic String Models,
</title>

<abstract>
In string theory there seems to be an intimate connection between spacetime and
world-sheet physics. Following this line of thought we investigate the family
problem in a particular class of string solutions, namely the free fermionic
string models. We find that the number of generations $N_g$ is related to the
index of the supersymmetry generator of the underlying $N=2$ internal
superconformal field theory which is always present in any $N=1$ spacetime
supersymmetric string vacuum. We also derive a formula for the index and thus
for the number of generations which is sensitive to the boundary condition
assignments of the internal fermions and to certain coefficients which
determine the weight with which each spin-structure of the model contributes to
the one-loop partition function. Finally we apply our formula to several
realistic string models in order to derive $N_g$ and we verify our results by
constructing explicitly the massless spectrum of these string models.
