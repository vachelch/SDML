An Alternate Approach to Transition Potentials
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze transition potentials $(V(r) \stackrel{r\sim 0}{\rightarrow}
{\alpha r^{-2}})$ in non-relativistic quantum mechanics using the techniques
of supersymmetry. For the range $-1/4 < \alpha < 3/4$, the eigenvalue
problem becomes ill-defined (since it is not possible to choose a unique
eigenfunction based on square integrability and boundary conditions). It is
shown that supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM) provides a natural
prescription for a unique determination of the spectrum. Interestingly, our
SUSYQM based approach picks out the same "less singular" wave functions as the
conventional approach, and thus provides a simple justification for the usual
practice in the literature. Two examples (the P\"oschl-Teller II potential and
a two anyon system on the plane) have been worked out for illustrative
purposes.
