Quantization of gauge theory for gauge dependent operators
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on a canonically derived path integral formalism, we demonstrate that
the perturbative calculation of the matrix element for gauge dependent
operators has crucial difference from that for gauge invariant ones. For a
gauge dependent operator ${\cal O}(\phi)$ what appears in the Feynman diagrams
is not ${\cal O} (\phi)$ itself, but the gauge-transformed one ${\cal
O}(^\omega \phi)$, where $\omega$ characterizes the specific gauge
transformation which brings any field variable into the particular gauge which
we have adopted to quantize the gauge theory using the canonical method. The
study of the matrix element of gauge dependent operators also reveals that the
formal path integral formalism for gauge theory is not always reliable.
