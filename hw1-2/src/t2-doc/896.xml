Defining Relations for Lie Superalgebras with Cartan matrix
</title>

<abstract>
  We completely describe presentations of Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix
if they are simple Z-graded of polynomial growth. Such matrices can be neither
integer nor symmetrizable. There are non-Serre relations encountered. In
certain cases there are infinitely many relations. Our results are applicable
to the Lie algebras with the same Cartan matrices as the Lie superalgebras
considered.
