Crystal Manyfold Universes in AdS Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive crystal braneworld solutions, comprising of intersecting families
of parallel $n+2$-branes in a $4+n$-dimensional $AdS$ space. Each family
consists of alternating positive and negative tension branes. In the simplest
case of exactly orthogonal families, there arise different crystals with
unbroken 4D Poincare invariance on the intersections, where our world can
reside. A crystal can be finite along some direction, either because that
direction is compact, or because it ends on a segment of $AdS$ bulk, or
infinite, where the branes continue forever. If the crystal is interlaced by
connected 3-branes directed both along the intersections and orthogonal to
them, it can be viewed as an example of a Manyfold universe proposed recently
by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, Dvali and the author. There are new ways for
generating hierarchies, since the bulk volume of the crystal and the lattice
spacing affect the 4D Planck mass. The low energy physics is sensitive to the
boundary conditions in the bulk, and has to satisfy the same constraints
discussed in the Manyfold universe. Phenomenological considerations favor
either finite crystals, or crystals which are infinite but have broken
translational invariance in the bulk. The most distinctive signature of the
bulk structure is that the bulk gravitons are Bloch waves, with a band
spectrum, which we explicitly construct in the case of a 5-dimensional theory.
