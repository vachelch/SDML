Non-divergence of gravitational self-interactions for Goto-Nambu strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical linearised gravitational self interaction of a Goto-Nambu
string is examined in four spacetime dimensions. Using a conveniently gauge
independent tensorial treatment, the divergent part of the self-force is shown
to be exactly zero. This is due to cancelation by a contribution that was
neglected in the previous treatments. This result has implications for many
applications.
