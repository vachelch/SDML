A Schwinger term in q-deformed su(2) algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  An extra term generally appears in the q-deformed $su(2)$ algebra for the
deformation parameter $q = \exp{ 2 \pi i\theta}$, if one combines the
Biedenharn-Macfarlane construction of q-deformed $su(2)$, which is a
generalization of Schwinger's construction of conventional $su(2)$, with the
representation of the q-deformed oscillator algebra which is manifestly free of
negative norm. This extra term introduced by the requirement of positive norm
is analogous to the Schwinger term in current algebra. Implications of this
extra term on the Bloch electron problem analyzed by Wiegmann and Zabrodin are
briefly discussed.
