On subdivision invariant actions for random surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a subdivision invariant action for dynamically triangulated
random surfaces that was recently proposed (R.V. Ambartzumian et. al., Phys.
Lett. B 275 (1992) 99) and show that it is unphysical: The grand canonical
partition function is infinite for all values of the coupling constants. We
conjecture that adding the area action to the action of Ambartzumian et. al.
leads to a well-behaved theory.
