Magnetic Wormholes and Vertex Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider wormhole solutions in $2+1$ Euclidean dimensions. A duality
transformation is introduced to derive a new action from magnetic wormhole
action of Gupta, Hughes, Preskill and Wise. The classical solution is
presented. The vertex operators corresponding to the wormhole are derived.
Conformally coupled scalars and spinors are considered in the wormhole
background and the vertex operators are computed. ( To be published in Phys.
