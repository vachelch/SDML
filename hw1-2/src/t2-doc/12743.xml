Entropy of N=2 black holes and their M-brane description
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we discuss the M-brane description for a N=2 black hole. This
solution is a result of the compactification of M-5-brane configurations over a
Calabi-Yau threefold with arbitrary intersection numbers $C_{ABC}$. In analogy
to the D-brane description where one counts open string states we count here
open 2-branes which end on the M-5-brane.
