On the correspondence between Light-Front Hamiltonian approach and
  Lorentz-covariant formulation for Quantum Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of the restoring of the equivalence between Light-Front (LF)
Hamiltonian and conventional Lorentz-covariant formulations of gauge theory is
solved for QED(1+1) and (perturbatively to all orders) for QCD(3+1). For
QED(1+1) the LF Hamiltonian is constructed which reproduces the results of
Lorentz-covariant theory. This is achieved by bosonization of the model and by
analysing the resulting bosonic theory to all orders in the fermion mass. For
QCD(3+1) we describe nonstandard regularization that allows to restore
mentioned equivalence with finite number of counterterms in LF Hamiltonian.
