White Holes, Black Holes and Cpt in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that a unitarity-violating but weakly CPT invariant
superscattering matrix exists for leading-order large-$N$ dilaton gravity, if
and only if one includes in the Hilbert space planckian ``thunderpop"
excitations which create white holes. CPT apparently cannot be realized in a
low-energy effective theory in which such states have been integrated out.
Rules for computing the leading-large-$N$ superscattering are described in
terms of quantum field theory on a single multiply-connected spacetime obtained
by sewing the future (past) horizons of the original spacetime with the past
(future) horizons of its CPT conjugate. Some difficulties which may arise in
going beyond leading order in $1/N$ are briefly discussed.
