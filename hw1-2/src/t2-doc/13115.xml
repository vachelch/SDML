Duality and the Legendre Transform
</title>

<abstract>
  We define a weak-strong coupling transformation based on the Legendre
transformation of the effective action. In the case of $N\es 2$ supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory, this coincides with the duality transform on the low energy
effective action considered by Seiberg and Witten. This Legendre transform
interpretation of duality generalizes directly to the full effective action,
and in principle to other theories.
