D-branes, Matrix Theory and K-homology
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we study a new matrix theory based on non-BPS D-instantons in
type IIA string theory and D-instanton - anti D-instanton system in type IIB
string theory, which we call K-matrix theory. The theory correctly incorporates
the creation and annihilation processes of D-branes. The configurations of the
theory are identified with spectral triples, which are the noncommutative
generalization of Riemannian geometry a la Connes, and they represent the
geometry on the world-volume of higher dimensional D-branes. Remarkably, the
configurations of D-branes in the K-matrix theory are naturally classified by a
K-theoretical version of homology group, called K-homology. Furthermore, we
argue that the K-homology correctly classifies the D-brane configurations from
a geometrical point of view. We also construct the boundary states
corresponding to the configurations of the K-matrix theory, and explicitly show
that they represent the higher dimensional D-branes.
