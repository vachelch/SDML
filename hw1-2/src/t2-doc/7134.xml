Continuum Limits of ``Induced QCD": Lessons of the Gaussian Model at d=1
  and Beyond
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the scalar field sector of the Kazakov--Migdal model of induced
QCD. We present a detailed description of the simplest one dimensional
{($d$$=$$1$)} model which supports the hypothesis of wide applicability of the
mean--field approximation for the scalar fields and the existence of critical
behaviour in the model when the scalar action is Gaussian. Despite the
ocurrence of various non--trivial types of critical behaviour in the $d=1$
model as $N\rightarrow\infty$, only the conventional large-$N$ limit is
relevant for its {\it continuum} limit. We also give a mean--field analysis of
the $N=2$ model in {\it any} $d$ and show that a saddle point always exists in
the region $m^2>m_{\rm crit}^2(=d)$. In $d=1$ it exhibits critical behaviour as
$m^2\rightarrow m_{\rm crit}^2$. However when $d$$>$$1$ there is no critical
behaviour unless non--Gaussian terms are added to the scalar field action. We
argue that similar behaviour should occur for any finite $N$ thus providing a
simple explanation of a recent result of D. Gross. We show that critical
behaviour at $d$$>$$1$ and $m^2>m^2_{\rm crit}$ can be obtained by adding a
$logarithmic$ term to the scalar potential. This is equivalent to a local
modification of the integration measure in the original Kazakov--Migdal model.
Experience from previous studies of the Generalized Kontsevich Model implies
that, unlike the inclusion of higher powers in the potential, this minor
modification should not substantially alter the behaviour of the Gaussian
model.
