On Higher Derivative Terms in Tachyon Effective Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconstruct the tachyon effective action for unstable D-branes in
superstring theory by examining its behaviour near exactly marginal
deformations, where the ambigous higher derivative terms can be eliminated. We
then compare this action with that obtained in boundary string field theory and
find remarkable agreement. In particular, the tension for lower dimensional
branes and the BI-action for the centre of mass motion are reprodued exactly.
We also comment on the action for tachyons on the kink in a
D-brane/anti-D-brane system and on bosonic string theory.
