Vortex Motion In Charged Fluids
</title>

<abstract>
  A non-relativistic scalar field coupled minimally to electromagnetism
supports in the presence of a homogeneous background electric charge density
the existence of smooth, finite-energy topologically stable flux vortices. The
static properties of such vortices are studied numerically in the context of a
two parameter model describing this system as a special case. It is shown that
the electrostatic and the mexican hat potential terms of the energy are each
enough to ensure the existence of vortex solutions. The interaction potential
of two minimal vortices is obtained for various values of the parameters. It is
proven analytically that a free isolated vortex with topological charge $N\ne
0$ is spontaneously pinned, while in the presence of an external force it moves
at a calculable speed and in a direction $(N/|N|) 90^0$ relative to it. In a
homogeneous external current $\tilde {\bf J}$ the vortex velocity is $\bf
V=-\tilde J$. Other theories with the same vortex behaviour are briefly
discussed.
