Branes, central charges and U-duality invariant BPS conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  In extended supergravity theories there are $p$-brane solutions preserving
different numbers of supersymmetries, depending on the charges, the spacetime
dimension and the number of original supersymmetries (8, 16 or 32). We find
U-duality invariant conditions on the quantized charges which specify the
number of supersymmetries preserved with a particular charge configuration.
These conditions relate U-duality invariants to the picture of intersecting
branes. The analysis is carried out for all extended supergravities with 16 or
32 supersymmetries in various dimensions.
