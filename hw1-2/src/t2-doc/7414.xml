Dirac Quantisation Conditions and Kaluza-Klein Reduction
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the form of the Dirac quantisation condition for the p-form
charges carried by p-brane solutions of supergravity theories. This condition
agrees precisely with the conditions obtained in lower dimensions, as is
necessary for consistency with Kaluza-klein dimensional reduction. These
considerations also determine the charge lattice of BPS soliton states, which
proves to be a universal modulus-independent lattice when the charges are
defined to be the canonical charges corresponding to the quantum supergravity
symmetry groups.
