Instability of charged black holes in anti-de Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  We exhibit a tachyonic mode in a linearized analysis of perturbations of
large anti-de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in four dimensions. In the
large black hole limit, and up to a 0.7% discrepancy which is probably
round-off error in the numerical analysis, the tachyon appears precisely when
the black hole becomes thermodynamically unstable.
