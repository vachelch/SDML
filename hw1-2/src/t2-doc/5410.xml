Wound D-branes in Gepner Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new prescription of how to represent D-branes in Gepner models
in more general homology classes than those in the previous constructions. The
central role is played by a certain projection acting on the
Recknagel-Schomerus boundary states. Consequently, the boundary states are in
most cases no longer a sum of products of N=2 Ishibashi states, but
nevertheless preserve spacetime supersymmetry and satisfy the Cardy condition.
We demonstrate these in the (k=1)^3 Gepner model in detail, and construct
boundary states for D-branes wound around arbitrary rigid 1-cycles on the
corresponding 2-torus. We also emphasize the necessity of some angle-dependent
transformations in identifying a proper free-field realization for each brane
tilted at an angle. In particular, this is essential for the Witten index to
give the correct intersection numbers between the different D-branes.
