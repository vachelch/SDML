A Variational Principle for Radial Flows in Holographic theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop furthur the correspondence between a d+1 dimensional theory and a
d dimensional one with the "radial" (d+1)th corodinate \rho playing the role of
an evolution parameter. We discuss the evolution of an effective action defined
on a d dimensional surface charactarized by \rho by means of a new variational
principle. The conditions under which the flow equations are valid are
discussed in detail as is the choice of boundary conditions. It is explained
how domain walls may be incorporated in the framework and some generalized
junction conditions are obtained. The general principles are illustrated on the
example of a supergravity theory on AdS_{d+1}.
