CP, Charge Fractionalizations and Low Energy Effective Actions in the
  SU(2) Seiberg-Witten Theories with Quarks
</title>

<abstract>
  Several dynamical aspects of the SU(2) Seiberg-Witten models with N_f quark
hypermultiplets are explored. We first clarify the meaning of the number of the
singularities of the space of vacua. CP invariance of the theories are then
studied and periodicities of theories in \theta with and without bare quark
masses are obtained ((4-N_f)\pi and \pi, respectively). CP noninvariance at a
generic point of QMS manifests itself as the electric and quark-number charge
fractionalizations for the dyons; we show that the exact Seiberg-Witten
solution contains such effects correctly, in agreement with the semiclassical
analysis recently made by F.Ferrari. Upon N=1 perturbation the low energy
effective theories at the singularities display confinement, and in most cases
chiral symmetry breaking as a consequence. In one of the vacua for N_f=3
confinement is not accompanied by chiral symmetry breaking: we interpret it as
an example of oblique confinement of 't Hooft. We discuss further the
consistency of the physical picture found here by studying the effects of soft
supersymmetry breaking as well as the behavior of the theory in the N=1 limit.
