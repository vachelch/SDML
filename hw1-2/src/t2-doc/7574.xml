Gauge Independence of the Effective Potential Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the formalism of extended BRS symmetry to the investigation of the
gauge dependence of the effective potential in a spontaneously symmetry broken
gauge theory. This formalism, which includes a set of Grassmann parameters
defined as the BRS variations of the gauge-fixing parameters, allows us to
derive in a quick and unambiguous way the related Nielsen identities, which
express the physical gauge independence, in a class of generalized 't Hooft
gauges, of the effective potential. We show in particular that the validity of
the Nielsen identities does not require any constraint on the gauge-fixing
parameters, to the contrary of some claims found in the literature. We use the
method of algebraic renormalization, which leads to results independent of the
particular renormalization scheme used.
