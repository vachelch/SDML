The Master Field for QCD and $q$-Deformed Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The master fields for the large $N$ limit of matrix models and gauge theory
are constructed. The master fields satisfy to standard equations of
relativistic field theory but fields are quantized according to a new rule. To
define the master field we use the Yang-Feldman equation with a free field
quantized in the Boltzmannian Fock space. The master field for gauge theory
does not take values in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra however there is a
non-Abelian gauge symmetry. For the construction of the master field it is
essential to work in Minkowski space-time and to use the Wightman correlation
functions. The BRST quantization of the master field for gauge theory and a
loop equation are considered.
