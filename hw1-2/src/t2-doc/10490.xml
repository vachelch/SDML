  theory

<abstract>
  We apply a derivative expansion to the Legendre effective action flow
equations of O(N) symmetric scalar field theory, making no other approximation.
We calculate the critical exponents eta, nu, and omega at the both the leading
and second order of the expansion, associated to the three dimensional
Wilson-Fisher fixed points, at various values of N. In addition, we show how
the derivative expansion reproduces exactly known results, at special values
N=infinity,-2,-4, ... .
