Superstring action in AdS_5 x S^5: kappa symmetry light cone gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  As part of program to quantize superstrings in AdS_5 x S^5 background in
light cone approach we find the explicit form of the corresponding
Green-Schwarz action in fermionic light-cone kappa-symmetry gauge. The
resulting action is quadratic and quartic in fermions. In the flat space limit
it reduces to the standard light-cone Green-Schwarz action, and also has the
correct superparticle limit. We discuss fixing the bosonic light-cone gauge and
a reformulation of the action in terms of 2-d Dirac spinors.
