Vacuum Structure of Softly Broken N=1 Supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We study softly broken N=1 supersymmetric QCD with the gauge group $SU(N_c)$
and $N_f$ flavors of quark pairs. We investigate vacuum structure of the theory
with generic soft supersymmetry breaking terms. Trilinear soft breaking terms
play an essential role in determining vacua. For $N_f=N_c+1$, chiral symmetry
is broken for a sufficiently large magnitude of trilinear couplings, while it
is unbroken in the case with only soft masses. In the case where appearance of
trilinear coupling terms is allowed, i.e. for $N_f \geq N_c+1$, we have two
possible vacua, the trivial and non-trivial ones. Otherwise, we only have the
non-trivial vacuum, which corresponds to the non-trivial vacuum in the $N_f
\geq N_c+1$ theory.
