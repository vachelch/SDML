Once More about Spectral-Dependent Quantum $R$-Matrix for $U_q(A_2)$
</title>

<abstract>
  The recently obtained results in \cite{ZG2} are used to compute the
explicitly spectral-dependent $R$-matrix (or the intertwiners) on
$V_{(6)}(x)\otimes V_{(6)}(y)$ and $V_{(3)}(x)\otimes V_{(6)}(y)$, where
$V_{(6)}$ and $V_{(3)}$ are the 6-dimensional and fundamental representations
of $U_q(A_2)$, respectively. It appears that the $R$-matrix on
$V_{(3)}(x)\otimes V_{(6)}(y)$ depends on $q$ in the different way from what
one might usually think: $q$ occurs in the $R$-matrix in fractional powers. It
seems to be the first example in literatures of $R$-matrix with the new
feature.
