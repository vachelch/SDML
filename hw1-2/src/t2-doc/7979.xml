Nonlinear Electromagnetic Self-Duality and Legendre Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss continuous duality transformations and the properties of classical
theories with invariant interactions between electromagnetic fields and matter.
The case of scalar fields is treated in some detail. Special discrete elements
of the continuous group are shown to be related to the Legendre transformation
with respect to the field strengths.
