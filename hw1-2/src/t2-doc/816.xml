Type I Strings with F- and B-Flux
</title>

<abstract>
  We present non-supersymmetric toroidal compactifications of type I string
theory with both constant background NSNS two-form flux and non-trivial
magnetic flux on the various D9-branes. The non-vanishing B-flux admits
four-dimensional models with three generations of chiral fermions in standard
model like gauge groups. Additionally, we consider the orbifold T^4/Z_2, again
with both kinds of background flux present, leading to non-supersymmetric as
well as supersymmetric models in six dimensions. All models have T-dual
descriptions as intersecting brane worlds.
