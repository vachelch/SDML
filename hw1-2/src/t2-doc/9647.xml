Generalised scalar particle quantisation in 1+1 dimensions and
  $D(2,1;\alpha)$

  The exceptional superalgebra $\D21a$ has been classified as a candidate
conformal supersymmetry algera in two dimensions. We propose an alternative
interpretation of it as an extended BFV-BRST quantisation superalgebra in 2D
($D(2,1;1) \simeq osp(2,2|2)$). A superfield realization is presented wherein
the standard extended phase space coordinates can be identified. The physical
states are studied via the cohomology of the BRST operator. Finally we reverse
engineer a classical action corresponding to the algebraic model we have
constructed, and identify the Lagrangian equations of motion.
