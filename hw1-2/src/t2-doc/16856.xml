Quantum-double for a nonstandard deformation of a Borel subalgebra
  $sl(2,C)$
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a construction of Drienfeld's quantum double for a nonstandard
deformation of Borel subalgebra of $sl(2)$. We construct explicitly some simple
representations of this quantum algebra and from the universal R-matrix we
obtain the explicit solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation in those cases.
