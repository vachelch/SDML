Calogero model and sL(2,R) algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The Calogero model with external harmonic oscillator potential is discussed
from sL(2,R) algebra point of view. Explicit formulae for functions with
exponential time behaviour are given; in particular, the integrals of motion
are constructed and their involutiveness demonstrated. The superintegrability
of the model appears to be a simple consequence of the formalism.
