A Generating Function for Fatgraphs
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a generating function for the sum over fatgraphs with specified
valences of vertices and faces, inversely weighted by the order of their
symmetry group. A compact expression is found for general (i.e. non necessarily
connected) fatgraphs. This expression admits a matrix integral representation
which enables to perform semi--classical computations, leading in particular to
a closed formula corresponding to (genus zero, connected) trees.
