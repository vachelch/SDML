Zamalodchikov's C-Theorem and The Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider perturbation of a conformal field theory by a pair of relevant
logarithmic operators and calculate the beta function up to two loops. We
observe that the beta function can not be derived from a potential. Thus the
renormalization group trajectories are not always along decreasing values of
the central charge. However there exists a domain of structure constants in
which the c-theorem still holds.
