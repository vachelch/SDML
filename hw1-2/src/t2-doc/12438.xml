Living with Ghosts
</title>

<abstract>
  Perturbation theory for gravity in dimensions greater than two requires
higher derivatives in the free action. Higher derivatives seem to lead to
ghosts, states with negative norm. We consider a fourth order scalar field
theory and show that the problem with ghosts arises because in the canonical
treatment, $\phi$ and $\Box \phi $ are regarded as two independent variables.
Instead, we base quantum theory on a path integral, evaluated in Euclidean
space and then Wick rotated to Lorentzian space. The path integral requires
that quantum states be specified by the values of $\phi$ and $\phi_{,\tau}$. To
calculate probabilities for observations, one has to trace out over
$\phi_{,\tau}$ on the final surface. Hence one loses unitarity, but one can
never produce a negative norm state or get a negative probability. It is shown
that transition probabilities tend toward those of the second order theory, as
the coefficient of the fourth order term in the action tends to zero. Hence
unitarity is restored at the low energies that now occur in the universe.
