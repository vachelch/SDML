On the gauge dependence of the topological sigma model beta functions
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the dependence on the classical action "gauge" parameters of the
beta functions of the standard topological sigma model in flat space. We thus
show that their value is a "gauge" artifact indeed. We also show that
previously computed values of these beta functions can be continuously
connected to one another by smoothly varying those gauge parameters.
