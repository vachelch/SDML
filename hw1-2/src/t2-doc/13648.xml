Integrable Lattice Realizations of Conformal Twisted Boundary Conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct integrable realizations of conformal twisted boundary conditions
for ^sl(2) unitary minimal models on a torus. These conformal field theories
are realized as the continuum scaling limit of critical A-D-E lattice models
with positive spectral parameter. The integrable seam boundary conditions are
labelled by (r,s,\zeta) in (A_{g-2},A_{g-1},\Gamma) where \Gamma is the group
of automorphisms of G and g is the Coxeter number of G. Taking symmetries into
account, these are identified with conformal twisted boundary conditions of
Petkova and Zuber labelled by (a,b,\gamma) in (A_{g-2}xG, A_{g-2}xG,Z_2) and
associated with nodes of the minimal analog of the Ocneanu quantum graph. Our
results are illustrated using the Ising (A_2,A_3) and 3-state Potts (A_4,D_4)
models.
