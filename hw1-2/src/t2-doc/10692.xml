Similarity Renormalization, Hamiltonian Flow Equations, and Dyson's
  Intermediate Representation
</title>

<abstract>
  A general framework is presented for the renormalization of Hamiltonians via
a similarity transformation. Divergences in the similarity flow equations may
be handled with dimensional regularization in this approach, and the resulting
effective Hamiltonian is finite since states well-separated in energy are
uncoupled. Specific schemes developed several years ago by Glazek and Wilson
and contemporaneously by Wegner correspond to particular choices within this
framework, and the relative merits of such choices are discussed from this
vantage point. It is shown that a scheme for the transformation of Hamiltonians
introduced by Dyson in the early 1950's also corresponds to a particular choice
within the similarity renormalization framework, and it is argued that Dyson's
scheme is preferable to the others for ease of computation. As an example, it
is shown how a logarithmically confining potential arises simply at second
order in light-front QCD within Dyson's scheme, a result found previously for
other similarity renormalization schemes. Steps toward higher order and
nonperturbative calculations are outlined. In particular, a set of equations
analogous to Dyson-Schwinger equations is developed.
