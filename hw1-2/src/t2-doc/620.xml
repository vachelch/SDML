String Field Theory and the Fuzzy Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  We use boundary string field theory to study open string tachyon condensation
on a three-sphere closed string background. We consider the closed string
background described by $SU(2)_k$ WZW model in the limit of large $k$. We
compute the exact tachyon potential and analyse the decay modes.
