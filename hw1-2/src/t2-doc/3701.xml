Mass vs. Charge: Quantum Radiation from Zero Temperature Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the mass-charge relation for the semiclassical extremal black hole
of the $S$-wave sector Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to $N$ conformal
scalars. The classical ratio $M/{|Q|}=1$ is shown to be modified to $M/{|Q|}
\simeq 1-k/6$ for small $ k \equiv N\hbar/(12\pi Q^{2})$. Furthermore,
numerical study for $k<2$ shows that $M/|Q|$ is a monotonically decreasing
function of $k$. We speculate on the consequence of such a modification in the
4-dimensional context.
