Near Hagedorn Dynamics of NS Fivebranes, or A New Universality Class of
  Coiled Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the thermodynamics of NS 5-branes as the temperature approaches
the NS 5-branes' Hagedorn temperature, and conclude that the dynamics of
``Little String Theory'' is a new universality class of interacting strings.
First we point out how to vary the temperature of the near extremal solution by
taking into account $g_s$ corrections. The Hagedorn temperature is shown to be
a limiting temperature for the theory. We then compare the thermodynamics to
that of a toy model made of free strings and find basic discrepancies. This
suggests a need for a new class of string interactions. We suggest that this
new universality class is characterized by a strong attractive
self-intersection interaction, which causes strings to be coiled. This model
might also explain why ``Little String Theories'' exist in at most 5+1
dimensions.
