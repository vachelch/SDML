A Spin - 3/2 Ising Model on a Square Lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  The spin - 3/2 Ising model on a square lattice is investigated. It is shown
that this model is reducible to an eight - vertex model on a surface in the
parameter space spanned by coupling constants J, K, L and M. It is shown that
this model is equivalent to an exactly solvable free fermion model along two
lines in the parameter space.
