Eigenvalue Distributions in Yang-Mills Integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate one-matrix correlation functions for finite SU(N) Yang-Mills
integrals with and without supersymmetry. We propose novel convergence
conditions for these correlators which we determine from the one-loop
perturbative effective action. These conditions are found to agree with
non-perturbative Monte Carlo calculations for various gauge groups and
dimensions. Our results yield important insights into the eigenvalue
distributions rho(lambda) of these random matrix models. For the bosonic
models, we find that the spectral densities rho(lambda) possess moments of all
orders as N -> Infinity. In the supersymmetric case, rho(lambda) is a wide
distribution with an N-independent asymptotic behavior rho(lambda) ~
lambda^(-3), lambda^(-7), lambda^(-15) for dimensions D=4,6,10, respectively.
