Remarks on the Collective Quantization of the SU(2) Skyrme Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out the question of ordering momentum operator in the canonical
\break quantization of the SU(2) Skyrme Model. Thus, we suggest a new
definition for the momentum operator that may solve the infrared problem that
appears when we try to minimize the Quantum Hamiltonian.
