Cosmological Evolution in a Type-0 String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the cosmological evolution of a type-0 string theory by employing
non-criticality, which may be induced by fluctuations of the D3 brane worlds.
We check the consistency of the approach to O(alpha ') in the corresponding
sigma-model. The ten-dimensional theory is reduced to an effective
four-dimensional model, with only time dependent fields. We show that the
four-dimensional universe has an inflationary phase and graceful exit from it,
while the other extra dimensions are stabilized to a constant value, with the
fifth dimension much larger than the others. We pay particular attention to
demonstrating the role of tachyonic matter in inducing these features. The
Universe asymptotes, for large times, to a non-accelerating linearly-expanding
Universe with a time-dependent dilaton and a relaxing to zero vacuum energy a
la quintessence.
