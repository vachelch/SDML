Thermofield Dynamics of the Closed Bosonic String - Physical Aspects of
  the Thermal Duality -
</title>

<abstract>
  The thermofield dynamics of the D=26 closed bosonic thermal string theory is
described in proper reference to the thermal duality symmetry as well as the
thermal stability of modular invariance in association with the global phase
structure of the bosonic thermal string ensemble.
