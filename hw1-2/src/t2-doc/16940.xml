Some Comments on the Spin of the Chern - Simons Vortices
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the spin of both the topological and nontopological solitons of
the Chern - Simons - Higgs model by using our approach based on constrained
analysis. We also propose an extension of our method to the non - relativistic
Chern - Simons models. The spin formula for both the relativistic and
nonrelativistic theories turn out to be structurally identical. This form
invariance manifests the topological origin of the Chern - Simons term
responsible for inducing fractional spin. Also, some comparisons with the
existing results are done.
