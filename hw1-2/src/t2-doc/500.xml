Reconstruction of SU(5) Grand Unified Model In Noncommutative Geometry
  Approach

<abstract>
  Based on the generalized gauge theory on $M^4\times Z_2\times Z_3$, we
reconstructed the realistic SU(5) Grand Unified model by a suitable
assignment of fermion fields. The action of group elements $Z_2$ on fermion
fields is the charge conjugation while the action of $Z_3$ elements represent
generation translation. We find that to fit the spontaneous symmetry breaking
and gauge hierarchy of SU(5) model a linear term of curvature has to be
introduced. A new mass relation is obtained in our reconstructed model.
