Local Scaling of Time in Hamiltonian Path Integration
</title>

<abstract>
Inspired by the usefulness of local scaling of time in the path integral
formalism, we introduce a new kind of hamiltonian path integral in this paper.
A special case of this new type of path integral has been earlier found useful
in formulating a scheme of hamiltonian path integral quantization in arbitrary
coordinates. This scheme has the unique feature that quantization in arbitrary
co-ordinates requires hamiltonian path integral to be set up in terms of the
classical hamiltonian only, without addition of any adhoc $ O(\hbar ^2) $terms.
In this paper we further study the properties of hamiltonian path integrals in
arbitrary co-ordinates with and without local scaling of time and obtain the
Schrodinger equation implied by the hamiltonian path integrals. As a simple
illustrative example of quantization in arbitrary coordinates and of exact path
integration we apply the results obtained to the case of Coulomb problem in two
dimensions.
