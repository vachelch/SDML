(Quasi)Localized Gauge Field on a Brane: Dissipating Cosmic Radiation to
  Extra Dimensions?
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a mechanism ensuring (quasi)localization of massless gauge fields
on a brane. The mechanism does not rely on BPS properties of the brane and can
be realized in any theory where charged particles are confined to the
world-volume. The localized matter fluctuations induce a gauge kinetic term on
the brane. At short distances the resulting propagator for the gauge field is
{\it identical} to the four-dimensional propagator. The gauge theory on the
brane is effectively four-dimensional at short distances; it becomes
higher-dimensional on very large (cosmic) scales. The brane-bulk system
exhibits the phenomenon of ``infrared transparency''. As a result, only very
low frequency modes can escape into extra dimensions. In this framework the
large wavelength cosmic radiation can dissipate in extra space at a rate that
may be observable, in principle. We briefly discuss some astrophysical
consequences of this scenario.
  The same mechanism of localization of gauge fields may work in Kaplan's
framework for domain wall chiral fermions on lattices.
