Integrable models and degenerate horizons in two-dimensional gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse an integrable model of two-dimensional gravity which can be
reduced to a pair of Liouville fields in conformal gauge. Its general solution
represents a pair of ``mirror'' black holes with the same temperature. The
ground state is a degenerate constant dilaton configuration similar to the
Nariai solution of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter case. The existence of
$\phi=const.$ solutions and their relation with the solution given by the 2D
Birkhoff's theorem is then investigated in a more general context. We also
point out some interesting features of the semiclassical theory of our model
and the similarity with the behaviour of AdS$_2$ black holes.
