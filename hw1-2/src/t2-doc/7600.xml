Quantized bulk scalar fields in the Randall-Sundrum brane-model
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the lowest order quantum corrections to the effective action
arising from a quantized real scalar field in the Randall-Sundrum background
spacetime. The leading term is the familiar vacuum, or Casimir, energy density.
The next term represents an induced gravity term that can renormalize the
4-dimensional Newtonian gravitational constant. The calculations are performed
for an arbitrary spacetime dimension. Two inequivalent boundary conditions,
corresponding to twisted and untwisted field configurations, are considered. A
careful discussion of the regularization and renormalization of the effective
action is given, with the relevant counterterms found. It is shown that the
requirement of self-consistency of the Randall-Sundrum solution is not simply a
matter of minimizing the Casimir energy density. The massless, conformally
coupled scalar field results are obtained as a special limiting case of our
results. We clarify a number of differences with previous work.
