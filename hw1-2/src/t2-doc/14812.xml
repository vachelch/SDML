(Anti-)Instantons and the Atiyah-Hitchin Manifold
</title>

<abstract>
  The Atiyah-Hitchin manifold arises in many different contexts, ranging from
its original occurrence as the moduli space of two SU(2) 't Hooft-Polyakov
monopoles in 3+1 dimensions, to supersymmetric backgrounds of string theory. In
all these settings, (super)symmetries require the metric to be hyperk\"ahler
and have an SO(3) transitive isometry, which in the four-dimensional case
essentially selects out the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold as the only such smooth
manifold with the correct topology at infinity. In this paper, we analyze the
exponentially small corrections to the asymptotic limit, and interpret them as
infinite series of instanton corrections in these various settings.
Unexpectedly, the relevant configurations turn out to be bound states of $n$
instantons and $\bar n$ anti-instantons, with $|n-\bar n|=0,1$ as required by
charge conservation. We propose that the semi-classical configurations relevant
for the higher monopole moduli space are Euclidean open branes stretched
between the monopoles.
