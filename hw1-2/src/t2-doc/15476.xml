Supersymmetric Gauge Theories from Branes and Orientifold Six-planes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study brane configurations in the presence of orientifold six-planes.
After deriving the curves for N=2 supersymmetric SU(Nc) gauge theories with one
flavor in the symmetric or antisymmetric representation and Nf fundamental
flavors, we rotate the brane configuration, reducing the supersymmetry to N=1.
For the case of an antisymmetric flavor and less than two fundamental flavors,
nonperturbative effects lead to a brane configuration that is topologically a
torus. Using the description of the orientifold six-planes as Dn singularities
we discuss the Higgs branches for N=2 brane configurations with Sp/SO gauge
groups and the related N=1 theories with tensor representations.
