Functional Integral Approach to the N-Flavor Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study massless QED_2 with N flavors using path integrals. We identify the
sector that is generated by the N^2 classically conserved vector currents. One
of them (the U(1) current) creates a massive particle, while the others create
massless ones. We show that the mass spectrum obeys a Witten-Veneziano type
formula. Two theorems on n-point functions clarify the structure of the Hilbert
space. Evaluation of the Fredenhagen-Marcu order parameter indicates that a
confining force exists only between charges that are integer multiples of +/-
Ne, whereas charges that are nonzero mod(N) screen their confining forces and
lead to non-vacuum sectors. Finally we identify operators that violate
clustering, and decompose the theory into clustering theta vacua.
