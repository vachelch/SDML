Super-p-brane actions from interpolating dualisations
</title>

<abstract>
  We review a recently proposed method for constructing super-p-brane
world-volume actions. In this approach, starting from a democratic choice of
world-volume gauge-fields guided by p-brane intersection rules, the
requirements of kappa-symmetry and gauge invariance can be used to determine
the corresponding action. We discuss the application of the method to some
cases of interest, notably the (p,q)-5-branes of type-IIB string theory in a
manifestly S-duality covariant formulation.
