Three-Family Supersymmetric Standard-like Models from Intersecting Brane
  Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the first three family N=1 supersymmetric string model with
Standard Model gauge group SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y from an orientifold of
type IIA theory on T^6/(Z_2 x Z_2) and D6-branes intersecting at angles. In
addition to the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model particles, the model
contains right-handed neutrinos, a chiral (but anomaly-free) set of exotic
multiplets, and extra vector-like multiplets. We discuss some phenomenological
features of this model.
