Operator product expansion in SL(2) conformal field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the conformal field theories having affine SL(2) symmetry, we study the
operator product expansion (OPE) involving primary fields in highest weight
representations. For this purpose, we analyze properties of primary fields with
definite SL(2) weights, and calculate their two- and three-point functions.
Using these correlators, we show that the correct OPE is obtained when one of
the primary fields belongs to the degenerate highest weight representation. We
briefly comment on the OPE in the SL(2,R) WZNW model.
