Integrable Structures in Supersymmetric Gauge and String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action of N=2 Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matter is shown to
be governed by an integrable spin model with spectral parameter on an elliptic
curve. We sketch a route to deriving this effective dynamics from the
underlying Yang-Mills theory. Natural generalizations of this structure to all
N=2 models, and to string theory, are suggested.
