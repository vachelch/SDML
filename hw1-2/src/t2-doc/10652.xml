Supersymmetric sigma-models, twistors, and the Atiyah-Hitchin metric
</title>

<abstract>
  The Legendre transform and its generalizations, originally found in
supersymmetric sigma-models, are techniques that can be used to give
constructions of hyperkahler metrics. We give a twistor space interpretation to
the generalizations of the Legendre transform construction. The Atiyah-Hitchin
metric on the moduli space of two monopoles is used as a detailed example.
