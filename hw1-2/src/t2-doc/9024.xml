A note on the dual of N=1 super Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We refine the dictionary of the gauge/gravity correspondence realizing N=1
super Yang-Mills by means of D5-branes wrapped on a resolved Calabi-Yau space.
This is done by fixing an ambiguity on the correct interpretation of the
holographic dual of the running gauge coupling and amounts to identify a
specific 2-cycle in the dual ten-dimensional supergravity background. In doing
so, we also discuss the role played in this context by gauge transformations in
the relevant seven-dimensional gauged supergravity. While all nice properties
of the duality are maintained, this modification of the dictionary has some
interesting physical consequences and solves a puzzle recently raised in the
literature. In this refined framework, it is also straightforward to see how
the correspondence naturally realizes a geometric transition.
