The Complete Black Brane Solutions in D-dimensional Coupled Gravity
  System
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we use only the equation of motion for an interacting system
of gravity, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor to study the black brane
solutions. By making use of the property of Schwarzian derivative, we obtain
the complete solution of this system of equations. For some special values we
obtain the well-known BPS brane and black brane solutions.
