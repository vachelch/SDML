D-particle polarizations with multipole moments of higher-dimensional
  branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the polarization states of the D0-brane in type IIA string theory.
In addition to states with angular momentum and magnetic dipole moments, there
are polarization states of a single D0-brane with nonzero D2-brane dipole and
magnetic H-dipole moments, as well as quadrupole and higher moments of various
charges. These fundamental moments of the D0-brane polarization states can be
determined directly from the linearized couplings of background fields to the
D0-brane world-volume fermions. These couplings determine the long range
supergravity fields produced by a general polarization state, which typically
have non-zero values for all the bosonic fields of type IIA supergravity. We
demonstrate the precise cancellation between spin-spin and magnetic
dipole-dipole interactions and an analogous cancellation between 3-form and
H-field dipole-dipole interactions for a pair of D0-branes. The first of these
cancellations follows from the fact that spinning D0-brane states have
gyromagnetic ratio g = 1, and the second follows from the fact that the ratio
between the 3-form and H-field dipole moments is also 1 in natural units. Both
of these relationships can be seen immediately from the couplings in the
D0-brane world-volume action.
