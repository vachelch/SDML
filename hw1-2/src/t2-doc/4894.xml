Supersymmetry and Euler Multiplets
</title>

<abstract>
  Some massless supermultiplets appear as the trivial solution of Kostant's
equation, a Dirac-like equation over special cosets. We study two examples; one
over the coset SU(3)/SU(2) times U(1) contains the N=2 hypermultiplet in (3+1)
dimensions with U(1) as helicity; the other over the coset F_4/SO(9) describes
the N=1 supermultiplet in eleven dimensions, where SO(9) is the light-cone
little group. We present the general solutions to Kostant's equation for both
cases; they describe massless physical states of arbitrary spins which display
the same relations as the fields in the supermultiplets. They come in sets of
three representations called Euler triplets, but do not display supersymmetry
although the number of bosons and fermions is the same when spin-statistics is
satisfied. We build the free light-cone Lagrangian for both cases.
