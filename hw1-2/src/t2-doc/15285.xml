Anomalous Jacobian Factor in the Polyakov Measure for Abelian Gauge
  Field in Curved Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  The Polyakov measure for the Abelian gauge field is considered in the
Robertson-Walker spacetimes. The measure is concretely represented by adopting
two kind of decompositions of the gauge field degrees of freedom which are most
familiarly used in the covariant and canonical path integrals respectively. It
is shown that the two representations are different by an anomalous Jacobian
factor from each other and also that the factor has a direct relationship to an
uncancellation factor of the contributions from the Faddeev-Popov ghost and the
unphysical part of the gauge field to the covariant one-loop partition
function.
