Derivative and higher order extensions of Davey-Stewartson equation from
  matrix KP hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the matrix KP hierarchy can yield new integrable equations
in $(2+1)$-dimensions along with the corresponding Lax pair. For particular
gauge choice this may result derivative and also a higher order nonlinear
extension of the Devay-Stewartson equation (DSE),the higher order DSE being a
higher dimensional generalisation of the Kundu- Eckhaus equation. Such gauge
transformation is shown also to produce significant extensions to the
constrained matrix KP system.
