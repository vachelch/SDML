Quantum Fluctuations and Dynamical Chaos: An Effective Potential
  Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the intimate connection between the chaotic dynamics of a
classical field theory and the instability of the one-loop effective action of
the associated quantum field theory. Using the example of massless scalar
electrodynamics, we show how the radiatively induced spontaneous symmetry
breaking stabilizes the vacuum state against chaos, and we speculate that
monopole condensation can have the same effect in non-Abelian gauge theories.
