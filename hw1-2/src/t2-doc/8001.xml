Mass Spectrum of Strings in Anti de Sitter Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform string quantization in anti de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The string
motion is stable, oscillatory in time with real frequencies $\omega_n=
\sqrt{n^2+m^2\alpha'^2H^2}$ and the string size and energy are bounded. The
string fluctuations around the center of mass are well behaved. We find the
mass formula which is also well behaved in all regimes. There is an {\it
infinite} number of states with arbitrarily high mass in AdS (in de Sitter (dS)
there is a {\it finite} number of states only). The critical dimension at which
the graviton appears is $D=25,$ as in de Sitter space. A cosmological constant
$\Lambda\neq 0$ (whatever its sign) introduces a {\it fine structure} effect
(splitting of levels) in the mass spectrum at all states beyond the graviton.
The high mass spectrum changes drastically with respect to flat Minkowski
spacetime. For $\Lambda<0,$ we find $<m^2>\sim \mid\Lambda\mid N^2,$ {\it
independent} of $\alpha',$ and the level spacing {\it grows} with the
eigenvalue of the number operator, $N.$ The density of states $\rho(m)$ grows
like $\mbox{Exp}[(m/\sqrt{\mid\Lambda\mid}\;)^{1/2}]$ (instead of
$\rho(m)\sim\mbox{Exp}[m\sqrt{\alpha'}]$ as in Minkowski space), thus {\it
discarding} the existence of a critical string temperature.
  For the sake of completeness, we also study the quantum strings in the black
string background, where strings behave, in many respects, as in the ordinary
black hole backgrounds. The mass spectrum is equal to the mass spectrum in flat
Minkowski space.
