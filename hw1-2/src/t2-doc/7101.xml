D-brane form factors at high energy
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the high energy, fixed angle, asymptotics of D-brane form factors to
all orders in string perturbation theory, using the Gross-Mende saddle point
techniques. The effective interaction size of all D-branes grows linearly with
the energy as (alpha') E/n, where n is the order of perturbation theory, except
for the D-instanton, whose form factor is dominated by end-point contributions,
and remains point-like at high orders. The qualitative features are independent
of the R-R or NS-NS character of the states used to probe the D-brane.
