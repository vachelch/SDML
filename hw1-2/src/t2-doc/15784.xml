Ground state and low excitations of an integrable chain with alternating
  spins
</title>

<abstract>
  An anisotropic integrable spin chain, consisting of spins $s=1$ and
$s=\frac{1}{2}$, is investigated \cite{devega}. It is characterized by two real
parameters $\bar{c}$ and $\tilde{c}$, the coupling constants of the spin
interactions. For the case $\bar{c}<0$ and $\tilde{c}<0$ the ground state
configuration is obtained by means of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Furthermore
the low excitations are calculated. It turns out, that apart from free magnon
states being the holes in the ground state rapidity distribution, there exist
bound states given by special string solutions of Bethe ansatz equations (BAE)
in analogy to \cite{babelon}. The dispersion law of these excitations is
calculated numerically.
