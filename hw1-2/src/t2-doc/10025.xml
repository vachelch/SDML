Freezing of Moduli with Fluxes in Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study warped compactifications to three dimensions, realized as an
orientifold of type IIA string theory on T^7. By turning on 3- and 4-form
fluxes on the torus in a supersymmetric way, we generate a potential for the
moduli fields. We present various flux configurations with N=1,2,3,4,5,6
supersymmetries and count the number of moduli in each case. In particular, we
show that there are N=1 configurations where all but one of the moduli are
frozen.
