Killing gauge for the 0-brane on $AdS_2 \times S^2$ coset superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  How to gauge fix $\k$-symmetry for the super 0-brane action on $AdS_2 \times
S^2$ in Killing gauge properly is discussed in order to find the superconformal
mechanics which describes super 0-brane probes moving on $AdS_2 \times S^2$.
The dependence on the coordinate frame for the proper Killing gauge is
considered and the subtleties of gauge-fixing $\k$-symmetry in Killing gauge
are analysed explicitly. It is found that the Killing gauge works indeed
without the imcompatibility if the magnetic charge of the super 0-brane is
nonzero.
