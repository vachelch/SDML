Low-Energy Effective Action of N=2 Gauge Multiplet Induced by
  Hypermultiplet Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We study one-loop effective action of hypermultiplet theory coupled to
external N=2 vector multiplet. We formulate this theory in N=1 superspace and
develop a general approach to constructing derivative expansion of the
effective action based on an operator symbol technique adopted to N=1
supersymmetric field models. The approach under consideration allows to
investigate on a unique ground a general structure of effective action and
obtain both N=2 superconformal invariant (non-holomorphic) corrections and
anomaly (holomorphic) corrections. The leading low-energy contributions to
effective action are found in explicit form.
