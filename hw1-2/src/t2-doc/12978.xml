Matrix models on the fuzzy sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  Field theory on a fuzzy noncommutative sphere can be considered as a
particular matrix approximation of field theory on the standard commutative
sphere. We investigate from this point of view the scalar $\phi^4$ theory. We
demonstrate that the UV/IR mixing problems of this theory are localized to the
tadpole diagrams and can be removed by an appropiate (fuzzy) normal ordering of
the $\phi^4$ vertex. The perturbative expansion of this theory reduces in the
commutative limit to that on the commutative sphere.
