Riemannian Gauge Theory and Charge Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  Particle theorists build gauge theories around an action with a symmetry
group. The gauge field of the action is similar to the connection coefficient
in the Riemannian covariant derivative. The field strength tensor is similar to
the curvature tensor. Inspired by these parallels with Riemannian geometry, we
propose a different construction. Instead of defining a gauge theory by a
group, we define a gauge theory by a vector bundle with fiber F = R^n or F =
C^n. Matter fields are Lorentz-invariant n-vectors on the vector-space fiber.
We set up orthonormal gauge basis vectors that span the vector bundle. By
expressing gauge-covariant fields in terms of orthonormal gauge basis vectors,
we obtain an SO(n) or U(n) gauge-covariant derivative. All matter fields on a
particular fiber couple with the same coupling constant. Even the matter fields
on a C^1 fiber, which have a U(1) symmetry group, couple with the same charge.
In this geometrical gauge theory, the multiple standard-model U(1) hypercharges
require unnatural constraints among the curvatures of independent vector
bundles. These constraints are naturally supplied by theories with grand
unification. Because our action is independent of the choice of basis, its
natural invariance group is GL(n,R) or GL(n,C).
