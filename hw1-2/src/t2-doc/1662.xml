Background Independent Open String Field Theory with Constant B field On
  the Annulus
</title>

<abstract>
  We study Witten's background independent open-string field theory in the
presence of a constant B-field at one loop level. The Green's function and the
partition function with a constant B-field are evaluated for an annulus.
