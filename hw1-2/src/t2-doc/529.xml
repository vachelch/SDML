Brane World Sum Rules
</title>

<abstract>
  A set of consistency conditions is derived from Einstein equations for brane
world scenarios with a spatially periodic internal space. In particular, the
sum of the total tension of the flat branes and the non-negative integral of
the gradient energy of the bulk scalars must vanish. This constraint allows us
to make a simple consistency check of several models. We show that the
two-brane Randall-Sundrum model satisfies this constraint, but it does not
allow a generalization with smooth branes (domain walls), independently of the
issue of supersymmetry. The Goldberger-Wise model of brane stabilization has to
include the backreaction on the metric and the fine tuning of the cosmological
constant to satisfy the constraints. We check that this is achieved in the
DeWolfe-Freedman-Gubser-Karch scenario. Our constraints are automatically
satisfied in supersymmetric brane world models.
