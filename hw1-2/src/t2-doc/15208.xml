Algebra of one-particle operators for the Calogero model
</title>

<abstract>
  An algebra ${\cal G}$ of symmetric {\em one-particle} operators is
constructed for the Calogero model. This is an infinite-dimensional
Lie-algebra, which is independent of the interaction parameter $\lambda$ of the
model. It is constructed in terms of symmetric polynomials of raising and
lowering operators which satisfy the commutation relations of the $S_N$-{\em
extended} Heisenberg algebra. We interpret ${\cal G}$ as the algebra of
observables for a system of identical particles on a line. The parameter
$\lambda$, which characterizes (a class of) irreducible representations of the
algebra, is interpreted as a statistics parameter for the identical particles.
