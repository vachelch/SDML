Minimal Unitary Models and The Closed SU(2)-q Invariant Spin Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Hamiltonian of the closed $SU(2)_{q}$ invariant chain. We
project a particular class of statistical models belonging to the unitary
minimal series. A particular model corresponds to a particular value of the
coupling constant. The operator content is derived. This class of models has
charge-dependent boundary conditions. In simple cases (Ising, 3-state Potts)
corresponding Hamiltonians are constructed. These are non-local as the original
spin chain.
