Weyl Anomaly in Higher Dimensions and Feynman Rules in Coordinate Space
</title>

<abstract>
  An algorithm to obtain the Weyl anomaly in higher dimensions is presented. It
is based on the heat-kernel method. Feynman rules, such as the vertex rule and
the propagator rule, are given in (regularized) coordinate space. Graphical
calculation is introduced. The 6 dimensional scalar-gravity theory is taken as
an example, and its explicit result is obtained.
