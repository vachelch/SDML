Instanton effects in string cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the gauge dyonic string solution of the K3 compactified heterotic
string theory in a four dimensional cosmological context. Since for this
solution Green-Schwarz as well as Chern-Simons corrections have been taken into
account it contains both world sheet and string loop corrections. The
cosmological picture is obtained by rotating the world volume of the gauge
dyonic string into two space like dimensions and compactifying those dimensions
on a two torus. We compare the result with gauge neutral extreme and
non-extreme cosmologies and find that the non-trivial Yang Mills background
leads to a solution without any singularities whereas for trivial Yang-Mills
backgrounds some of the fields become always singular at the big bang.
