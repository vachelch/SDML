The Chern-Simons Action in Non-Commutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  A general definition of Chern-Simons actions in non-commutative geometry is
proposed and illustrated in several examples. These are based on
``space-times'' which are products of even-dimensional, Riemannian spin
manifolds by a discrete (two-point) set. If the *algebras of operators
describing the non-commutative spaces are generated by functions over such
``space-times'' with values in certain Clifford algebras the Chern-Simons
actions turn out to be the actions of topological gravity on the
even-dimensional spin manifolds. By contrasting the space of field
configurations in these examples in an appropriate manner one is able to
extract dynamical actions from Chern-Simons actions.
