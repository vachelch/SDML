A short representation of the six-dimensional (2, 0) algebra

<abstract>
  We construct a BPS-saturated representation of the six-dimensional (2, 0)
algebra with a certain non-zero value of the `central' charge. This
representation is naturally carried by strings with internal degrees of freedom
rather than by point particles. Upon compactification on a circle, it reduces
to a massive vector multiplet in five dimensions. We also construct quantum
fields out of the creation and annihilation operators of the states of this
representation, and show how they give rise to a conserved two-form current
that can be coupled to a tensor multiplet. We hope that these results may be
relevant for understanding the degrees of freedom associated with strings in
interacting (2, 0) theories.
