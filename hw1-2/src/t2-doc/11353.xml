Point Group Invariants in the $U_{qp}(u(2))$ Quantum Algebra Picture
</title>

<abstract>
  Some consequences of a $qp$-quantization of a point group invariant developed
in the enveloping algebra of $SU(2)$ are examined in the present note. A set of
open problems concerning such invariants in the $U_{qp}(u(2))$ quantum algebra
picture is briefly discussed.
