D-Brane Stability and Monodromy
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the idea of Pi-stability for B-type D-branes on a Calabi-Yau
manifold. It is shown that the octahedral axiom from the theory of derived
categories is an essential ingredient in the study of stability. Various
examples in the context of the quintic Calabi-Yau threefold are studied and we
plot the lines of marginal stability in several cases. We derive the conjecture
of Kontsevich, Horja and Morrison for the derived category version of monodromy
around a "conifold" point. Finally, we propose an application of these ideas to
the study of supersymmetry breaking.
