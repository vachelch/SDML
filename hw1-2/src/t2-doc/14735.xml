Single Particle Excitations in the Lattice E_8 Ising Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present analytic expressions for the single particle excitation energies
of the 8 quasi-particles in the lattice $E_8$ Ising model and demonstrate that
all excitations have an extended Brillouin zone which, depending on the
excitation, ranges from 0<P < 4\pi to 0< P< 12 \pi. These are compared with
exact diagonalizations for systems through size 10 and with the E_8 fermionic
representations of the characters of the critical system in order to study the
counting statistics.
