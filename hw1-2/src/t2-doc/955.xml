Noncommutative QED and Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment
</title>

<abstract>
  The muon anomalous $g$ value, $a_\mu=(g-2)/2$, is calculated up to one-loop
level in noncommutative QED. We argue that relativistic muon in E821 experiment
nearly always stays at the lowest Landau level. So that spatial coordinates of
muon do not commute each other. Using parameters of E821 experiment, $B=14.5$KG
and muon energy 3.09GeV/c, we obtain the noncommutativity correction to $a_\mu$
is about $1.57\times 10^{-9}$, which significantly makes standard model
prediction close to experiment.
