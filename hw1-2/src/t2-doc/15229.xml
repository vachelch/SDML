A Technique for generating Feynman Diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
We present a simple technique that allows to generate Feynman diagrams for
vector models with interactions of order $2n$ and similar models (Gross-Neveu,
Thirring model), using a bootstrap equation that uses only the free field value
of the energy as an input. The method allows to find the diagrams to, in
principle, arbitrarily high order and applies to both energy and correlation
functions. It automatically generates the correct symmetry factor (as a
function of the number of components of the field) and the correct sign for any
diagram in the case of fermion loops. We briefly discuss the possibility of
treating QED as a Thirring model with non-local interaction.
