D-brane - Anti-D-brane Forces in Plane Wave Backgrounds: A Fall From
  Grace
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the nature of the force between a D-brane and an anti-D-brane in the
maximally supersymmetric plane wave background of type IIB superstring theory,
which is equipped with a mass parameter mu. An early such study in flat
spacetime(mu=0) served to sharpen intuition about D-brane interactions, showing
in particular the key role of the "stringy halo" that surrounds a D-brane. The
halo marks the edge of the region within which tachyon condensation occurs,
opening a gateway to new non-trivial vacua of the theory. It seems pertinent to
study the fate of the halo for non-zero mu. Focusing on the simplest cases of
p=+1,-1, we find here that for branes located at the origin, the radius of the
halo shrinks for increasing mu. For branes away from the origin, this shrinking
persists, and is accompanied by a shift of the centre of the halo away from the
D-brane. In fact, we observe that for large enough mu, or beyond a critical
distance from the origin, D-branes can lose their halo entirely! We suspect
that the consequences of this physics for key notions about the dynamics,
stability and classification of D-branes (such as tachyon condensation,
K-theory, etc.,) may well be quite significant.
