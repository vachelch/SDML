One-Loop Self-Dual and N=4 Super Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  We conjecture a simple relationship between the one-loop maximally helicity
violating gluon amplitudes of ordinary QCD (all helicities identical) and those
of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (all but two helicities identical). Because
the amplitudes in self-dual Yang Mills have been shown to be the same as the
maximally helicity violating ones in QCD, this conjecture implies that they are
also related to the maximally helicity violating ones of N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills. We have an explicit proof of the relation up to the six-point
amplitude; for amplitudes with more external legs, it remains a conjecture. A
similar conjecture relates amplitudes in self-dual gravity to maximally
helicity violating N=8 supergravity amplitudes.
