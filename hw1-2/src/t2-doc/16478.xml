On the M5 and the AdS7/CFT6 Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  The chiral primary operators of the D=6 superconformal (2,0) theory
corresponding to 14 scalars of N=4 D=7 supergravity are obtained by expanding
the world volume action for the M5-brane around an AdS_7 x S^4 background. In
the leading order, the operators take their values in the symmetric traceless
representation of the SO(5) R-symmetry group in consistency with the early
conjecture on their structure based on the superconformal symmetry and
Matrix-like model arguments.
