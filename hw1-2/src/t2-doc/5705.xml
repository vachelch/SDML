Vortex Dynamics in Self-Dual Chern-Simons Higgs Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider vortex dynamics in self-dual Chern-Simons Higgs systems. We show
that the naive Aharanov-Bohm phase is the inverse of the statistical phase
expected from the vortex spin, and that the self-dual configurations of
vortices are degenerate in energy but not in angular momentum. We also use the
path integral formalism to derive the dual formulation of Chern-Simons Higgs
systems in which vortices appear as charged particles. We argue that besides
the electromagnetic interaction, there is an additional interaction between
vortices, the so-called Magnus force, and that these forces can be put together
into a single `dual electromagnetic' interaction. This dual electromagnetic
interaction leads to the right Aharanov-Bohm phase. We also derive and study
the effective action for slowly moving vortices, which contains terms both
linear and quadratic in the vortex velocity.
