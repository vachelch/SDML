Tachyon Condensation in Noncommutative Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the decay of the D2-\bar{D2} system with large worldvolume
magnetic fields can be described in noncommutative gauge theory. Tachyon
condensation in this system describes the annihilation of D2-\bar{D2} into
$D0$-branes. From the 2+1 dimensional point of view, this is the decay of a
nonabelian magnetic flux into vortices. The semiclassical approximation is
valid over a long period of the decay. Our analysis allows us to clarify
earlier results in the literature related to tachyon condensation and
noncommutative gauge theory.
