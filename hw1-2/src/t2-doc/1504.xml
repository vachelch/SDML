Direct Calculation of the Critical Effective Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  The critical effective potential is the nonperturbative part of the effective
action at a phase transition. It equals the scale invariant effective average
potential and can be calculated from the renormalization group flow of the
effective average action. In some cases this requires only the solution of an
ordinary differential equation without actually simulating the renormalization
group flow. Here the Ising model is examined beyond leading order and with full
field dependent effective potential.
