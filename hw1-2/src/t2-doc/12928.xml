Two Ising Models Coupled to 2-Dimensional Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  To investigate the properties of $c=1$ matter coupled to $2$d{--}gravity we
have performed large-scale simulations of two copies of the Ising Model on a
dynamical lattice. We measure spin susceptibility and percolation critical
exponents using finite-size scaling. We show explicitly how logarithmic
corrections are needed for a proper comparison with theoretical exponents. We
also exhibit correlations, mediated by gravity, between the energy and magnetic
properties of the two Ising species. The prospects for extending this work
beyond $c=1$ are addressed.
