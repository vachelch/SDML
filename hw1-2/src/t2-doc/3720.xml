Aspects of T-duality in Open Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We study T-duality for open strings in various $D$-manifolds in the approach
of canonical transformations. We show that this approach is particularly useful
to study the mapping of the boundary conditions since it provides an explicit
relation between initial and dual variables. We consider non-abelian duality
transformations and show that under some restrictions the dual is a curved
$(d-{\rm dim}G-1)$ D-brane, where $d$ is the dimension of the space-time and
$G$ the non-abelian symmetry group. The generalization to $N=1$ supersymmetric
sigma models with abelian and non-abelian isometries is also considered.
