Scalar fluctuations in dilatonic brane-worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive and solve the full set of scalar perturbation equations for a class
of five-dimensional brane--world solutions, with a dilaton scalar field coupled
to the bulk cosmological constant and to a 3-brane. The spectrum contains one
localized massless scalar mode, to be interpreted as an effective dilaton on
the brane, inducing long--range scalar interactions. Two massive scalar modes
yield corrections to Newton's law at short distances, which persist even in the
limit of vanishing dilaton (namely, in the standard Randall--Sundrum
configuration).
