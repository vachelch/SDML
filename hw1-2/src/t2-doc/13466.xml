The dynamics of vortices on S^2 near the Bradlow limit
</title>

<abstract>
  The explicit solutions of the Bogomolny equations for N vortices on a sphere
of radius R^2 > N are not known. In particular, this has prevented the use of
the geodesic approximation to describe the low energy vortex dynamics. In this
paper we introduce an approximate general solution of the equations, valid for
R^2 close to N, which has many properties of the true solutions, including the
same moduli space CP^N. Within the framework of the geodesic approximation, the
metric on the moduli space is then computed to be proportional to the Fubini-
Study metric, which leads to a complete description of the particle dynamics.
