Undulating Strings and Gauge Theory Waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We study some dynamical aspects of the correspondence between strings in AdS
space and external heavy quarks in N=4 SYM. Specifically, by examining waves
propagating on such strings, we make some plausible (and some surprising)
inferences about the time-dependent fields produced by oscillating quarks in
the strongly-coupled gauge theory. We point out a puzzle regarding energy
conservation in the SYM theory. In addition, we perform a similar analysis of
the gauge fields produced by a baryon (represented as a D5-brane with
string-like extension in AdS space) and compare and contrast with the gauge
fields produced by a quark-antiquark pair (represented as a string looping
through AdS space).
