Curvature actions on Spin(n) bundles
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the number of linearly independent ways in which a tensor of Weyl
type may act upon a given irreducible tensor-spinor bundle V over a Riemannian
manifold. Together with the analogous but easier problem involving actions of
tensors of Einstein type, this enumerates the possible curvature actions on V.
