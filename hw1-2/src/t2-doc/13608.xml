Unconstrained Variables of Non-Commutative Open Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The boundary conditions of the bosonic string theory in non-zero $B$-field
background are equivalent to the second class constraints of a discretized
version of the theory. By projecting the original canonical coordinates onto
the constraint surface we derive a set of coordinates of string that are
unconstrained.These coordinates represent a natural framework for the
quantization of the theory.
