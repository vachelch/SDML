The Coulomb Branch of (4,4) Supersymmetric Field Theories in Two
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study (4,4) supersymmetric field theories in two dimensions with a one
dimensional Coulomb branch. These theories have applications in string theory.
Our analysis explains the known relation between $A-D-E$ groups and modular
invariants of affine SU(2).
