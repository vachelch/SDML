Higher Loop Anomalies and their Consistency Conditions in Nonlocal
  Regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  An algebraic program of computation and characterization of higher loop BRST
anomalies is presented. We propose a procedure for disentangling a genuine{\it
local} higher loop anomaly from the quantum dressings of lower loop anomalies.
For such higher loop anomalies we derive a local consistency condition, which
is the generalisation of the Wess-Zumino condition for the one-loop anomaly.
The development is presented in the framework of the field-antifield formalism,
making use of a nonlocal regularization method. The theoretical construction is
exemplified by explicitly computing the two-loop anomaly of chiral $W_3$
gravity. We also give, for the first time, an explicit check of the local
two--loop consistency condition that is associated with this anomaly.
