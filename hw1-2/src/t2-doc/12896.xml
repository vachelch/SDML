Dimensional regularization of the path integral in curved space on an
  infinite time interval
</title>

<abstract>
  We use dimensional regularization to evaluate quantum mechanical path
integrals in arbitrary curved spaces on an infinite time interval. We perform
3-loop calculations in Riemann normal coordinates, and 2-loop calculations in
general coordinates. It is shown that one only needs a covariant two-loop
counterterm (V_{DR} = R/8) to obtain the same results as obtained earlier in
other regularization schemes. It is also shown that the mass term needed in
order to avoid infrared divergences explicitly breaks general covariance in the
final result.
