Instantons and scattering in N=4 SYM in 4D
</title>

<abstract>
  We study classical solutions (ic-instantons) in N=4 SYM in 4D which, in the
strong coupling limit, correspond to complex two-dimensional manifolds.
Asymptotically in time the latter have boundaries represented by compact real
three-manifolds. Therefore they lend themselves to an interpretation in terms
of 3-brane scattering. We suggest that these solutions may represent scattering
of D3-branes of type IIB theory in 10D. In particular we show that the
world-volume theory on complex two-dimensional manifolds is the correct one for
D3-branes.
