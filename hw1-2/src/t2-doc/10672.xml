Constrained Quantization of Charged Strings in Background B Field and
  g-Factors
</title>

<abstract>
  The Dirac quantization is performed for the constrained system of the open
string with different charges located at both ends in the constant background B
field. Noncommutativity reveals to commutators [X, X], [P, P] and also [X,P] at
both ends of the string. We consider a dependence on the change of the
"cyclotron frequency" of the charged string. The g-factor of the charged string
is also calculated in the framework of our formulation.
