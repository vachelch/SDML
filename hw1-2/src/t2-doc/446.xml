Gauge theory of second class constraints without extra variables
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that any theory with second class constraints may be cast into a
gauge theory if one makes use of solutions of the constraints expressed in
terms of the coordinates of the original phase space. We perform a Lagrangian
path integral quantization of the resulting gauge theory and show that the
natural measure follows from a superfield formulation.
