Classical Solutions of SU(3) Pure Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Regular classical solutions of pure SU(3) gauge theories, in Minkowsky
spacetime, are computed in the Landau gauge. The classical fields have an
intrinsic energy scale and produce quark confinement if interpreted in the
sense of a nonrelativistic potential. Moreover, the quark propagator in the
background of these fields vanishes at large positive and negative time and
space separations.
