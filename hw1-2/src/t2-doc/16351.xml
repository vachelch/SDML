Hamiltonian Reduction of SU(2) Yang-Mills Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The unconstrained system equivalent to SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory is
obtained in the framework of the generalized Hamiltonian formalism using the
method of Hamiltonian reduction. The reduced system is expressed in terms of
fields which transform as spin zero and spin two under spatial rotations.
