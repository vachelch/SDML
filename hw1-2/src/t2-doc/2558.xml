Non-commutative "*-charge radius" and "*-dipole moment" of the neutrino
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we propose to obtain a lower bound for the mass scale of
space-time non-commutativity, considering the photon--neutrino interaction. We
evaluate a non-commutative "*-dipole moment" and "*-charge radius". From the
"*-dipole moment" we obtain the bound $\Lambda_{\rm NC} \geq M^*=2\pi(\sqrt 2
G_F)^{-1/2} \simeq 1.5$ TeV by comparing it with the standard model
contribution assuming it to be correct. This is a generic estimate, whereas
details depend on the neutrino mass matrix. Next we find that the "*-charge
radius" depends on the non-commutativity between space and time as
$<r^2_{\nu}>^2_{\rm NC}=3\sum_{i=1}^3 ({\theta}^{0i})^2$, and is $\leq 0.3
\times 10^{-33} {\rm cm}^2$ at a scale of non-commutativity of $\Lambda_{\rm
NC} \geq 1.5 \rm TeV$. This number is smaller than the bounds obtained from
astrophysics.
