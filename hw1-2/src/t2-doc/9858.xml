On the Classicality of Broda's SU(2) Invariant of 4-manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent work of Roberts has shown that the first surgical 4-manifold invariant
of Broda and (up to an unspecified normalization factor) the state-sum
invariant arising from the TQFT of Crane-Yetter are equivalent to the signature
of the 4-manifold. Subsequently Broda defined another surgical invariant in
which the 1- and 2-handles are treated differently. We use a refinement of
Roberts' techniques developped by the authors in hep-th/9309063 to show that
the "improved" surgical invariant of Broda also depends only on the signature
and Euler character
