Quarks, monopoles and dyons at large N
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a system of external particles of various charges in N =4 super
Yang-Mills in the large N limit at finite temperature. We demonstrate that at
high enough temperature partial or complete screening of the particles can
occur. At zero temperature the total electric or magnetic charge cannot be
screened, while higher multipole moments of these charges can be screened. The
specific case of a quark, a monopole and a dyon is worked out and the above
properties are verified. We also discuss the free energy of isolated particles
and show that their entropy is independent of the temperature.
