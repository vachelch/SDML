Infinite Families of Gauge-Equivalent $R$-Matrices and Gradations of
  Quantized Affine Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Associated with the fundamental representation of a quantum algebra such as
$U_q(A_1)$ or $U_q(A_2)$, there exist infinitely many gauge-equivalent
$R$-matrices with different spectral-parameter dependences. It is shown how
these can be obtained by examining the infinitely many possible gradations of
the corresponding quantum affine algebras, such as $U_q(A_1^{(1)})$ and
$U_q(A_2^{(1)})$, and explicit formulae are obtained for those two cases.
Spectral-dependent similarity (gauge) transformations relate the $R$-matrices
in different gradations. Nevertheless, the choice of gradation can be
physically significant, as is illustrated in the case of quantum affine Toda
field theories.
