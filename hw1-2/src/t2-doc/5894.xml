More on the exact solution of the O(n) model on a random lattice and an
  investigation of the case |n|>2

<abstract>
  For $n\in [-2,2]$ the $O(n)$ model on a random lattice has critical points to
which a scaling behaviour characteristic of 2D gravity interacting with
conformal matter fields with $c\in [-\infty,1]$ can be associated. Previously
we have written down an exact solution of this model valid at any point in the
coupling constant space and for any $n$. The solution was parametrized in terms
of an auxiliary function. Here we determine the auxiliary function explicitly
as a combination of $\theta$-functions, thereby completing the solution of the
model. Using our solution we investigate, for the simplest version of the
model, hitherto unexplored regions of the parameter space. For example we
determine in a closed form the eigenvalue density without any assumption of
being close to or at a critical point. This gives a generalization of the
Wigner semi-circle law to $n\neq 0$. We also study the model for $|n|>2$. Both
for $n<-2$ and $n>2$ we find that the model is well defined in a certain region
of the coupling constant space. For $n<-2$ we find no new critical points while
for $n>2$ we find new critical points at which the string susceptibility
exponent $\gamma_{str}$ takes the value $+\frac{1}{2}$.
