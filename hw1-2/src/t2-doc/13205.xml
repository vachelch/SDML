Complex geometry of conifolds and 5-brane wrapped on 2-sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate solutions of type II supergravity which have the product R^4 x
M^6 structure with non-compact M^6 factor and which preserve at least four
supersymmetries. In particular, we consider various conifolds and the N=1
supersymmetric NS5-brane wrapped on 2-sphere solution recently discussed in
hep-th/0008001. In all of these cases, we explicitly construct the complex
structures, and the Kaehler and parallel (3,0) forms of the corresponding M^6.
In addition, we verify that the above solutions preserve, respectively, eight
and four supersymmetries of type II theory. We also demonstrate that the
ordinary and fractional D3-brane solutions on singular, resolved and deformed
conifolds, and the (S-dual of) NS5-brane wrapped on 2-sphere can be obtained as
special cases from a universal ansatz for the supergravity fields and a single
1-d action governing their radial evolution. We show that like the 3-branes on
conifolds, the NS5-brane on 2-sphere background can be found as a solution of
first order system following from a superpotential.
