Consistent reduction of N=2 -> N=1 four dimensional supergravity coupled
  to matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the constraints which follow both on the geometry and on the gauge
sector for a consistent supergravity reduction of a general matter-coupled N=2
supergravity theory in four dimensions. These constraints can be derived in an
elegant way by looking at the fermionic sector of the theory.
