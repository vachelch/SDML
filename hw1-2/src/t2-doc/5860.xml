Excitations of D-strings, Entropy and Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the BPS and low energy non-BPS excitations of the D-string, in
terms of open strings that travel on the D-string. We use this to study the
energy thresholds for exciting a long D-string, for arbitrary winding number.
We also compute the leading correction to the entropy from non-BPS states for a
long D-string, and observe the relation of all these quantities with the
corresponding quantities for the elementary string.
