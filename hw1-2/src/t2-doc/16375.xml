Locating Overlap Information in Quantum Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  When discussing the black hole information problem the term ``information
flow'' is frequently used in a rather loose fashion. In this article I attempt
to make this notion more concrete. I consider a Hilbert space which is
constructed as a tensor product of two subspaces (representing for example
inside and outside the black hole). I discuss how the system has the capacity
to contain information which is in NEITHER of the subspaces. I attempt to
quantify the amount of information located in each of the two subspaces, and
elsewhere, and analyze the extent to which unitary evolution can correspond to
``information flow''. I define the notion of ``overlap information'' which
appears to be well suited to the problem.
