Counting Curves with Modular Forms
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the type IIA string compactified on the Calabi-Yau space given by
a degree 12 hypersurface in the weighted projective space ${\bf P}^4_{(1, 1,
2,2, 6)}$. We express the prepotential of the low-energy effective supergravity
theory in terms of a set of functions that transform covariantly under $PSL(2,
\IZ)$ modular transformations. These functions are then determined by monodromy
properties, by singularities at the massless monopole point of the moduli
space, and by $S \leftrightarrow T$ exchange symmetry.
