Clockwork SUSY: Supersymmetric Ward and Slavnov-Taylor Identities At
  Work in Green's Functions and Scattering Amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the cancellations among Feynman diagrams that implement the Ward and
Slavnov-Taylor identities corresponding to the conserved supersymmetry current
in supersymmetric quantum field theories. In particular, we show that the
Faddeev-Popov ghosts of gauge- and supersymmetries never decouple from the
physical fields, even for abelian gauge groups. The supersymmetric
Slavnov-Taylor identities provide efficient consistency checks for automatized
calculations and can verify the supersymmetry of Feynman rules and the
numerical stability of phenomenological predictions simultaneously.
