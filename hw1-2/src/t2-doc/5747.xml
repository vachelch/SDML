Effective Average Actions and Nonperturbative Evolution Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective average actions for gauge theories and the associated
nonperturbative evolution equations which govern their renormalization group
flow are reviewed and various applications are described. As an example of a
topological field theory, Chern-Simons theory is discussed in detail.
