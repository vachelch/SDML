Monads, Strings, and M Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The recent developments in string theory suggest that the space-time
coordinates should be generalized to non-commuting matrices. Postulating this
suggestion as the fundamental geometrical principle, we formulate a candidate
for covariant second quantized RNS superstrings as a topological field theory
in two dimensions. Our construction is a natural non-Abelian extension of the
RNS string. It also naturally leads to a model with manifest 11-dimensional
covariance, which we conjecture to be a formulation of M theory. The
non-commuting space-time coordinates of the strings are further generalized to
non-commuting anti-symmetric tensors. The usual space-time picture and the free
superstrings appear only in certain special phases of the model. We derive a
simple set of algebraic equations, which determine the moduli space of our
model. We test some aspects of our conjectual M theory for the case of
compactification on $T^2$.
