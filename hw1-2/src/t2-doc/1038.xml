From Screening to Confinement in a Gauge-Invariant Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  Features of screening and confinement are reviewed in two-dimensional quantum
electrodynamics (QED2). Our discussion is carried out using the gauge-invariant
but path-dependent variables formalism. This alternative and useful approach
exploits the rich structure of the electromagnetic cloud or dressing around
static fermions in a straightforward and simple way.
