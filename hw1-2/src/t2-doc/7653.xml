Dyonic Integrable Models
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of non abelian affine Toda models arising from the axial gauged
two-loop WZW model is presented. Their zero curvature representation is
constructed in terms of a graded Kac-Moody algebra. It is shown that the
discrete multivacua structure of the potential together with non abelian nature
of the zero grade subalgebra allows soliton solutions with non trivial electric
and topological charges.
 The dressing transformation is employed to explicitly construct one and two
soliton solutions and their bound states in terms of the tau functions. A
discussion of the classical spectra of such solutions and the time delays are
given in detail.
