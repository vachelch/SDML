Quantum Dirac constraints, Ward identities and path integral in
  relativistic gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum Dirac constraints in generic constrained system are solved by
directly calculating in the one-loop approximation the path integral with
relativistic gauge fixing procedure. The calculations are based on the
reduction algorithms for functional determinants extended to gauge theories.
Explicit mechanism of transition from relativistic gauge conditions to unitary
gauges, participating in the construction of this solution, is revealed by the
method of Ward identities.
