Loop Variables and Gauge Invariance in (Open) Bosonic String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a simplified and more complete description of the loop variable
approach for writing down gauge invariant equations of motion for the fields of
the open string. A simple proof of gauge invariance to all orders is given. In
terms of loop variables, the interacting equations look exactly like the free
equations, but with a loop variable depending on an extra parameter, thus
making it a band of finite width. The arguments for gauge invariance work
exactly as in the free case. We show that these equations are Wilsonian RG
equations with a finite world-sheet cutoff and that in the infrared limit,
equivalence with the Callan-Symanzik $\beta$-functions should ensure that they
reproduce the on-shell scattering amplitudes in string theory. It is applied to
the tachyon-photon system and the general arguments for gauge invariance can be
easily checked to the order calculated. One can see that when there is a finite
world sheet cutoff in place, even the U(1) invariance of the equations for the
photon, involves massive mode contributions. A field redefinition involving the
tachyon is required to get the gauge transformations of the photon into
standard form.
