Soliton Solutions of M-theory on an Orbifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly construct soliton solutions in the low energy description of
M-theory on S^1/Z_2. It is shown that the 11-dimensional membrane is a BPS
solution of this theory if stretched between the Z_2 hyperplanes. A similar
statement holds for the 11-dimensional 5--brane oriented parallel to the
hyperplanes. The parallel membrane and the orthogonal 5-brane, though
solutions, break all supersymmetries. Furthermore, we construct the analog of
the gauge 5-brane with gauge instantons on the hyperplanes. This solution
varies nontrivially along the orbifold direction due to the gauge anomalies
located on the orbifold hyperplanes. Its zero mode part is identical to the
weakly coupled 10-dimensional gauge 5-brane.
