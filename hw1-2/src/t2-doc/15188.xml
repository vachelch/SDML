Norcor vs the Abominable Gauge Completion
</title>

<abstract>
  We use normal coordinate methods to obtain the expansion with respect to
fermionic coordinates of the 11-dimensional supermembrane action in a
supergravity background. Likewise, expansions for various branes in other
dimensions can be obtained. These methods allow a systematic and unambiguous
expansion of the vielbein to any order in the fermionic coordinates and avoid
the complications encountered in the gauge completion approach.
