Bosonization of vertex operators for the $A^{(1)_{n-1}$ face model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a free boson realization of the vertex operators and their duals
for the solvable SOS lattice model of $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$ type. We discuss a
possible connection to the calculation of the correlation functions.
