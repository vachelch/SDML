Schrodinger Equation for Particle with Friction
</title>

<abstract>
  A new quantum mechanical wave equation describing a particle with frictional
forces is derived. It depends on a parameter $\alpha$ whose range is determined
by the coefficient of friction $\gamma$, that is, $0 \leq \alpha \leq \gamma$.
For one extreme value of this parameter, $\alpha = 0$, we recover Kostin's
equation. For the other extreme value, $\alpha = \gamma$, we obtain an equation
in which friction manifests in "magnetic" type terms. It further exhibits
breakdown of translational invariance, manifesting through a symmetry breaking
parameter $\beta$, as well as localized stationary states in the absence of
external potentials. Other physical properties of this new class of equations
are also discussed.
