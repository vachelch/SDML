Integrable Many-Body Systems via Inozemtsev Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  The Inozemtsev limit (IL) or the scaling limit is known to be a procedure
applied to the elliptic Calogero Model. It is a combination of the
trigonometric limit, infinite shifts of particles coordinates and rescalings of
the coupling constants. As a result, one obtains an exponential type of
interaction. In the recent paper it is shown that the IL applied to the
$sl(N,\bf C)$ elliptic Euler-Calogero Model and the elliptic Gaudin Model
produces new Toda-like systems of $N$ interacting particles endowed with
additional degrees of freedom corresponding to a coadjoint orbit in $sl(n,\bf
C)$. The limits corresponding to the complete degeneration of the orbital
degrees provide only ordinary periodic and non periodic Toda systems. We
introduce a classification of the systems appearing in the $sl(3,\bf C)$ case
via IL. The classification is represented on two-dimensional space of
parameters describing the infinite shifts of the coordinates. This space is
subdivided into symmetric domains. The mixture of the Toda and the
trigonometric Calogero-Sutherland potentials emerges on the low dimensional
domain walls of this picture. Due to obvious symmetries this classification can
be generalized to the arbitrary number of particles. We also apply IL to
$sl(2,\bf C)$ elliptic Gaudin Model with two marked points on the elliptic
curve and discuss main features of its possible limits. The limits of Lax
matrices are also considered.
