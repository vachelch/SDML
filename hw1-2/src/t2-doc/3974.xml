Maverick Examples Of Coset Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We present coset conformal field theories whose spectrum is not determined by
the identification current method. In these ``maverick'' cosets there is a
larger symmetry identifying primary fields than under the identification
current. We find an A-D-E classification of these mavericks. }
