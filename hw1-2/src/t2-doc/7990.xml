A Moduli Fixing Mechanism in M theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study M theory compactifications on manifolds of $G_2$-holonomy with gauge
and matter fields supported at singularities. We show that, under certain
topological conditions, the combination of background $G$-flux and background
fields at the singularities induces a potential for the moduli with an isolated
minimum. The theory in the minimum is supersymmetric and has a negative
cosmological constant in the simplest case. In a more realistic scenario, we
find that the fundamental scale is around 10 Tev and the heirarchy between the
four dimensional Planck and electroweak scales may be explained by the value of
a topological invariant. Hyperbolic three-manifolds enter the discussion in an
interesting way.
