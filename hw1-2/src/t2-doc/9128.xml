Supergravity on the Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that smooth domain wall spacetimes supported by a scalar field
separating two anti-de-Sitter like regions admit a single graviton bound state.
Our analysis yields a fully non-linear supergravity treatment of the
Randall-Sundrum model. Our solutions describe a pp-wave propagating in the
domain wall background spacetime. If the latter is BPS, our solutions retain
some supersymmetry. Nevertheless, the Kaluza-Klein modes generate ``pp
curvature'' singularities in the bulk located where the horizon of AdS would
ordinarily be.
