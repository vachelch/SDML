Fractional Statistics in Three Dimensions: Compact Maxwell-Higgs System
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a (3+1)-dimensional system composed of an open magnetic vortex
and an electrical point charge exhibits the phenomenon of Fermi-Bose
transmutation. In order to provide the physical realization of this system we
focus on the lattice compact scalar electrodynamics $SQED_c$ whose topological
excitations are open Nielsen-Olesen strings with magnetic monopoles attached at
their ends.
