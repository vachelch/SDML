Remarks on the structure constants of the Verlinde algebra associated to
  $sl_3$
</title>

<abstract>
The structure constants $N_{\lambda, \mu}^{\mu+\nu}$ of the $sl_2$ Verlinde
algebra as functions of $\mu$ either vanish or can be expressed after a change
of variable as the weight function of an irreducible representation of $sl_2$.
We give a similar formula in the $sl_3$ case.
