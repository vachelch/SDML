Wilson loop and dS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate Wilson loop (quark anti-quark potential) in dS/CFT
correspondence. The brane-world model is considered where bulk is two 5d
Euclidean de Sitter spaces and boundary (brane) is 4d de Sitter one. Starting
from the Nambu-Goto action, the calculation of the effective tension (average
energy) is presented. Unlike to the case of supergravity calculation of Wilson
loop in AdS/CFT set-up, there is no need to regularize the Nambu-Goto action
(the volume of de Sitter space is finite). It turns out that at sufficiently
small curvature of 5d background the energy (potential) is positive and linear
on the distance between quark and anti-quark what indicates to the possibility
of confinement.
