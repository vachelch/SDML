High Energy Scattering on Distant Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the elastic scattering of two open strings living on two D-branes
separated by a distance $r$. We compute the high-energy behavior of the
amplitude, to leading order in string coupling, as a function of the scattering
angle $\phi$ and of the dimensionless parameter $v=
r/(\pi\alpha^\prime\sqrt{s})$ with $\sqrt{s}$ the center-of-mass energy. The
result exhibits an interesting phase diagram in the $(v,\phi)$ plane, with a
transition at the production threshold for stretched strings at $v=1$. We also
discuss some more general features of the open-string semiclassical
world-sheets, and use T-duality to give a quantum tunneling interpretation of
the exponential suppression at high-energy.
