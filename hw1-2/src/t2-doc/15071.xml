  This paper discusses a procedure for the consistent coupling of gauge- and
matter superfields to supersymmetric sigma-models on symmetric coset spaces of
Kaehler type. We exhibit the finite isometry transformations and the
corresponding Kaehler transformations. These lead to the construction of a
generalized type of Killing potentials. In certain cases a charge quantization
condition needs to be imposed to guarantee the global existence of a line
bundle on a coset space. The results are applied to the explicit construction
of sigma-models on cosets SO(2N)/U(N). Only a finite number of these models can
consistently incorporate matter in representations descending from the
spinorial representations of SO(2N). We investigate in detail some aspects of
the vacuum structure of the gauged SO(10)/U(5) theory, with surprising results:
the fully gauged minimal anomaly-free model is shown be singular, as the
kinetic terms of the quasi-Goldstone fermions vanish in the vacuum. Gauging
only the linear isometry group SU(5)xU(1), or one of its subgroups, can give a
physically well-behaved theory. With gauged U(1) this requires the
Fayet-Iliopoulos term to take values in a specific limited range.
