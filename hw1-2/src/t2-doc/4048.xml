CP violation including universal one-loop corrections and heterotic
  M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  CP violation by soft supersymmetry-breaking terms in orbifold
compactifications is investigated. We include the universal part of the
moduli-dependent threshold corrections in the construction of the
non-perturbative effective potential due to gaugino-condensation. This allows
interpolation of the magnitude of CP violating phases between the weakly and
strongly coupled regimes. We find that the universal threshold corrections have
a large effect on the CP violating phases in the weakly coupled regime.
