Superfield formulation of the Lagrangian BRST quantization method
</title>

<abstract>
  Lagragian quantization rules for general gauge theories are proposed on a
basis of a superfield formulation of the standard BRST symmetry. Independence
of the $S$-matrix on a choice of the gauge is proved. The Ward identities in
terms of superfields are derived.
