$q$-Virasoro Algebra and the Point-Splitting
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a particular $q$-deformation of the Virasoro algebra can be
interpreted in terms of the $q$-local field $\Phi (x)$ and the Schwinger-like
point-splitted Virasoro currents, quadratic in $\Phi (x)$. The $q$-deformed
Virasoro algebra possesses an additional index $\alpha$, which is directly
related to point-splitting of the currents. The generators in the $q$-deformed
case are found to exactly reproduce the results obtained by probing the fields
$X(z)$ (string coordinate) and $\Phi (z)$ (string momentum) with the
non-splitted Virasoro generators and lead to a particular representation of the
$SU_q (1,1)$ algebra characterized by the standard conformal dimension $J$ of
the field. Some remarks concerning the $q$-vertex operator for the interacting
$q$-string theory are made.
