On the Bound States of p- and (p+2)-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study bound states of D-p-branes and D-(p+2)-branes. By switching on a
large magnetic field F on the (p+2) brane, the problem is shown to admit a
perturbative analysis in an expansion in inverse powers of F. It is found that,
to the leading order in 1/F, the quartic potential of the tachyonic state from
the open string stretched between the p- and (p+2)-brane gives a vacuum energy
which agrees with the prediction of the BPS mass formula for the bound state.
We generalize the discussion to the case of m p-branes plus 1 (p+2)-brane with
magnetic field. The T dual picture of this, namely several (p+2)-branes
carrying some p-brane charges through magnetic flux is also discussed, where
the perturbative treatment is available in the small F limit. We show that once
again, in the same approximation, the tachyon condensates give rise to the
correct BPS mass formula. The role of 't Hooft's toron configurations in the
extension of the above results beyond the quartic approximation as well as the
issue of the unbroken gauge symmetries are discussed. We comment on the
connection between the present bound state problem and Kondo-like problems in
the context of relevant boundary perturbations of boundary conformal field
theories.
