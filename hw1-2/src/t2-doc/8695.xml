On the scattering amplitude in the Aharonov-Bohm gauge field
</title>

<abstract>
  A general expression for the scattering amplitude of nonrelativistic spinless
particles in the Aharonov-Bohm gauge potential is obtained within the time
independent formalism. The result is valid also in the backward and forward
directions as well as for any choice of the boundary conditions on the wave
function at the flux tube position.
