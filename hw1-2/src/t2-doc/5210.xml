Forced Topological Nontrivial Field Configurations
</title>

<abstract>
  The motion of a one-dimensional kink and its energy losses are considered as
a model of interaction of nontrivial topological field configurations with
external fields. The approach is based on the calculation of the zero modes
excitation probability in the external field. We study in the same way the
interaction of the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole with weak external fields. The
basic idea is to treat the excitation of a monopole zero mode as the monopole
displacement. The excitation is found perturbatively. As an example we consider
the interaction of the t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole with an external uniform
magnetic field.
