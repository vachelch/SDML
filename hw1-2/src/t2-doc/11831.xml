Mixed Correlation Functions of the Two-Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the correlation functions mixing the powers of two non-commuting
random matrices within the same trace. The angular part of the integration was
partially known in the literature: we pursue the calculation and carry out the
eigenvalue integration reducing the problem to the construction of the
associated biorthogonal polynomials. The generating function of these
correlations becomes then a determinant involving the recursion coefficients of
the biorthogonal polynomials.
