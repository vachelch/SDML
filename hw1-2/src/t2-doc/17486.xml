Using the Hopf Algebra Structure of QFT in Calculations
</title>

<abstract>
  We employ the recently discovered Hopf algebra structure underlying
perturbative Quantum Field Theory to derive iterated integral representations
for Feynman diagrams. We give two applications: to massless Yukawa theory and
quantum electrodynamics in four dimensions.
