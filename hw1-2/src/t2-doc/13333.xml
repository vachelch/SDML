Fadeev-Popov Ghosts and 1+1 Dimensional Black Hole Evaporation
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently Callan, Giddings, Harvey and the author derived a set of one-loop
semiclassical equations describing black hole formation/evaporation in
two-dimensional dilaton gravity conformally coupled to $N$ scalar fields. These
equations were subsequently used to show that an incoming matter wave develops
a black hole type singularity at a critical value $\phi_{cr}$ of the dilaton
field. In this paper a modification to these equations arising from the
Fadeev-Popov determinant is considered and shown to have dramatic effects for
$N<24$, in which case $\phi_{cr}$ becomes complex. The $N<24$ equations are
solved along the leading edge of an incoming matter shock wave and found to be
non-singular. The shock wave arrives at future null infinity in a zero energy
state, gravitationally cloaked by negative energy Hawking radiation. Static
black hole solutions supported by a radiation bath are also studied. The
interior of the event horizon is found to be non-singular and asymptotic to
deSitter space for $N<24$, at least for sufficiently small mass. It is noted
that the one-loop approximation is {\it not} justified by a small parameter for
small $N$. However an alternate theory (with different matter content) is found
for which the same equations arise to leading order in an adjustable small
parameter.
