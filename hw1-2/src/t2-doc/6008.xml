The String Tension in Two Dimensional Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We review and elaborate on properties of the string tension in
two-dimensional gauge theories. The first model we consider is massive QED in
the $m\ll e$ limit. We evaluate the leading string tension both in the
fermionic and bosonized descriptions. We discuss the next to leading
corrections in $m/e$. The next-to-leading terms in the long distance behavior
of the quark-antiquark potential, are evaluated in a certain region of external
versus dynamical charges. The finite temperature behavior is also determined.
In $QCD_2$ we review the results for the string tension of quarks in cases with
dynamical quarks in the fundamental, adjoint, symmetric and antisymmetric
representations. The screening nature of $SYM_2$ is re-derived.
