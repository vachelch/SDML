Generalized Kontsevich Model Versus Toda Hierarchy and Discrete Matrix
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We represent the partition function of the Generalized Kontsevich Model (GKM)
in the form of a Toda lattice $\tau$-function and discuss various implications
of non-vanishing "negative"- and "zero"-time variables: the appear to modify
the original GKM action by negative-power and logarithmic contributions
respectively. It is shown that so deformed $\tau$-function satisfies the same
string equation as the original one. In the case of quadratic potential GKM
turns out to describe {\it forced} Toda chain hierarchy and, thus, corresponds
to a {\it discrete} matrix model, with the role of the matrix size played by
the zero-time (at integer positive points). This relation allows one to discuss
the double-scaling continuum limit entirely in terms of GKM, $i.e.$ essentially
in terms of {\it finite}-fold integrals.
