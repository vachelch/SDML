Quantum algebras and Lie groups
</title>

<abstract>
   Lie groups and quantum algebras are connected through their common universal
enveloping algebra. The adjoint action of Lie group on its algebra is naturally
extended to related q-algebra and q-coalgebra. In such a way, quantum structure
can be dealt more or less as the Lie one and we do not need to introduce the
not easy to handle topological groups.
   Composed system also is described by the suitably symmetrized q-coalgebra.
   A physical application to the phonon, irreducible unitary representation of
E_q(1,1), shows both the transformation under the group action of one phonon
state and the fusion of two phonons, by means of the coproduct, in only one
phonon lying on a branch of the appropriate dispersion relation.
