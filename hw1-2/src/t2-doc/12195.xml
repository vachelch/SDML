Comments on the renormalizability of the Broken Phase in Noncommutative
  Scalar Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the noncommutative $\phi^4$ theory with spontaneously broken global
O(2) symmetry in 4 dimensions. We demonstrate the renormalizability at one
loop. This does not require any choice of ordering of the fields in the
interaction terms. It involves regulating the ultraviolet and infrared
divergences in a manner consistent with the Ward identities.
