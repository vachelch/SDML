Mesonic Spectra of Bosonized QCD_2 Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss bosonized two-dimensional QCD with massless fermions in the
adjoint and multi-flavor fundamental representations. We evaluate the massive
mesonic spectra of several models by using the light-front quantization and
diagonalizing the mass operator $M^2=2P^+P^- $. We recover previous results in
the case of one flavor adjoint fermions and we find the exact massive spectrum
of multi flavor QCD in the limit of large number of flavors.
