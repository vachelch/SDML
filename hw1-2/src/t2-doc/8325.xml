Expectation values of local fields for a two-parameter family of
  integrable models and related perturbed conformal field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the vacuum expectation values of local fields for the
two-parameter family of integrable field theories introduced and studied by
Fateev. Using this result we propose an explicit expression for the vacuum
expectation values of local operators in parafermionic sine-Gordon models and
in integrable perturbed SU(2) coset conformal field theories.
