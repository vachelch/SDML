Dynamical Mass Generation for Non-Abelian Gauge Fields without the Higgs
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an alternative to the Higgs mechanism to generate masses for
non-abelian gauge fields in (3+1)-dimensions. The initial Lagrangian is
composed of a fermion with current-current and dipole-dipole type
self-interactions minimally coupled to non-abelian gauge fields. The mass
generation occurs upon the fermionic functional integration. We show that by
fine-tuning the coupling constants the effective theory contains massive
non-abelian gauge fields without any residual scalars or other degrees of
freedom.
