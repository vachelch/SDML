  The computation of $\kappa$-anomalies in the Green-Schwarz heterotic
superstring sigma-model and the corresponding Wess-Zumino consistency condition
constitute a powerful alternative approach for the derivation of manifestly
supersymmetric string effective actions. With respect to the beta-function
approach this technique presents the advantage that a result which is obtained
with the computation of beta-functions at $n$ loops can be obtained through the
calculation of $\kappa$-anomalies at \hbox{$n-1$} loops. In this paper we
derive by a direct one-loop perturbative computation the $\kappa$-anomaly
associated to the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons threeform and, for the first time,
the one associated to the Lorentz Chern-Simons threeform. Contrary to what is
often stated in the literature we show that the Lorentz $\kappa$-anomaly gets
contributions from the integration over both the fermionic {\it and\/} bosonic
degrees of freedom of the string. A careful analysis of the absolute
coefficients of all these anomalies reveals that they can be absorbed by
setting $dH={\alpha'\over4}(\trace F^2-\trace R^2)$, where $\alpha'$ is the
string tension, the expected result. We show that this relation ensures also
the absence of gauge and Lorentz anomalies in the sigma-model effective action.
We evidenciate the presence of infrared divergences.
