Gauge Symmetry and Localized Gravity in M Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the possibility of having gravity ``localized'' in dimension d in
a system where gauge bosons propagate in dimension d+1. In such a circumstance
- depending on the rate of falloff of the field strengths in d dimensions - one
might expect the gauge symmetry in d+1 dimensions to behave like a global
symmetry in d dimensions, despite the presence of gravity. Naive extrapolation
of warped long-wavelength solutions of general relativity coupled to scalars
and gauge fields suggests that such an effect might be possible. However, in
some basic realizations of such solutions in M theory, we find that this effect
does not persist microscopically. It turns over either to screening or the
Higgs mechanism at long distances in the d-dimensional description of the
system. We briefly discuss the physics of charged objects in this type of
system.
