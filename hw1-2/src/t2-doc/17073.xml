Hidden Quantum Group Symmetry in the Chiral Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the SL(2,C) lattice Kac-Moody algebra of Alekseev, Faddeev and
Semenov-Tian-Shansky to obtain a new lattice description of the SU(2) chiral
model in two dimensions. The system has a global quantum group symmetry and it
can be regarded as a deformation of two different theories. One is the
nonabelian Toda lattice which is obtained in the limit of infinite central
charge, while the other is a nonstandard Hamiltonian description of the chiral
model obtained in the continuum limit.
