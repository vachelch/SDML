Abelian and center gauge fixing in continuum Yang-Mills-Theory for
  general gauge groups
</title>

<abstract>
  A prescription for center gauge fixing for pure Yang-Mills theory in the
continuum with general gauge groups is presented. The emergence of various
types of singularities (magnetic monopoles and center vortices) appearing in
the course of the gauge fixing procedure are discussed.
