Trees, forests and jungles: a botanical garden for cluster expansions
</title>

<abstract>
  Combinatoric formulas for cluster expansions have been improved many times
over the years. Here we develop some new combinatoric proofs and extensions of
the tree formulas of Brydges and Kennedy, and test them on a series of
pedagogical examples.
