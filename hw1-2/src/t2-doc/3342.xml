Dark Energy May Probe String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of dark energy arises due to its self-gravitating properties.
Therefore explaining vacuum energy may become a question for the realm of
quantum gravity, that can be addressed within string theory context. In this
talk I concentrate on a recent, string-inspired model, that relies on nonlinear
physics of short-distance perturbation modes, for explaining dark energy
without any fine-tuning. Dark energy can be observationally probed by its
equation of state, w. Different models predict different types of equations of
state and string-inspired ones have a time dependent w(z) as their unique
signature. Exploring the link between dark energy and string theory may provide
indirect evidence for the latter, by means of precision cosmology data.
