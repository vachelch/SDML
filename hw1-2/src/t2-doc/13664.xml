Superfield BRST Charge and the Master Action
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a superfield formulation of extended phase space, we propose a new form
of the Hamiltonian action functional. A remarkable feature of this construction
is that it directly leads to the BV master action on phase space. Conversely,
superspace can be used to construct nilpotent BRST charges directly from
solutions to the classical Lagrangian Master Equation. We comment on the
relation between these constructions and the specific master action proposal of
Alexandrov, Kontsevich, Schwarz and Zaboronsky.
