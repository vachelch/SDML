Elliptic Calogero-Moser system from two dimensional current algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that elliptic Calogero-Moser system and its Lax operator found by
Krichever can be obtained by Hamiltonian reduction from the integrable
Hamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle to the central extension of the
algebra of SL(N,C) currents.Elliptic deformation of Yang-Mills theory is
presented.
