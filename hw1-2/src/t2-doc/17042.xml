Applications of the Ashtekar gravity to four dimensional hyperk\"ahler
  geometry and Yang-Mills Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  The Ashtekar-Mason-Newman equations are used to construct the hyperk\"ahler
metrics on four dimensional manifolds. These equations are closely related to
anti self-dual Yang-Mills equations of the infinite dimensional gauge Lie
algebras of all volume preserving vector fields. Several examples of
hyperk\"ahler metrics are presented through the reductions of anti self-dual
connections. For any gauge group anti self-dual connections on hyperk\"ahler
manifolds are constructed using the solutions of both Nahm and Laplace
equations.
