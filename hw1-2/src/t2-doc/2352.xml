Superconformal Symmetry, Supergravity and Cosmology

<abstract>
  We introduce the general N=1 gauge theory superconformally coupled to
supergravity. The theory has local SU(2,2|1) symmetry and no dimensional
parameters. The superconformal origin of the Fayet-Iliopoulos terms is
clarified. The phase of this theory with spontaneously broken conformal
symmetry gives various formulations of N=1 supergravity interacting with
matter, depending on the choice of the R-symmetry fixing.
  We have found that the locally superconformal theory is useful for describing
the physics of the early universe with a conformally flat FRW metric. Few
applications of superconformal theory to cosmology include the study of i)
particle production after inflation, particularly the non-conformal helicity
1/2 states of gravitino, ii) the super-Higgs effect in cosmology and the
derivation of the equations for the gravitino interacting with any number of
chiral and vector multiplets in the gravitational background with varying
scalar fields, iii) the weak coupling limit of supergravity and
gravitino-goldstino equivalence. This explains why gravitino production in the
early universe is not suppressed in the limit of weak gravitational coupling.
  We discuss the possible existence of an unbroken phase of the superconformal
theories, interpreted as a strong coupling limit of supergravity.
