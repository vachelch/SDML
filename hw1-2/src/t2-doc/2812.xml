Singularities in Graviton-Dilaton System: Their Implications on the PPN
  Parameters and the Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  Alternatives to Einstein's theory of general relativity can be distinguished
by measuring the parametrised post Newtonian parameters. Two such parameters
$\beta$ and $\gamma$, equal to one in Einstein theory, can be obtained from
static spherically symmetric solutions. For the graviton-dilaton system, as in
Brans-Dicke or low energy string theory, we find that if $\gamma \ne 1$ for a
charge neutral point star, then there exist naked singularities. Thus, if
$\gamma$ is measured to be different from one, then it cannot be explained by
these theories, without implying naked singularities. We also couple a
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to the graviton-dilaton system, a la string
theory. We find that static spherically symmetric solutions in low energy
string theory, which describe the gravitational field of a point star in the
real universe atleast upto a distance $r_* \simeq {\cal O} ({\rm pc})$, always
lead to curvature singularities. These singularities are stable and much worse
than the naked ones. Requiring their absence upto a distance $r_*$ implies a
bound $| \Lambda | < 10^{- 102} (\frac{r_*}{{\rm pc}})^{- 2}$ in natural units.
If $r_* \simeq 1 {\rm Mpc}$ then $| \Lambda | < 10^{- 114}$, and if $r_*$
extends all the way upto the edge of the universe ($10^{28} {\rm cm}$) then $|
\Lambda | < 10^{- 122}$ in natural units.
