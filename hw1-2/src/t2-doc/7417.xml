Shadows of the Planck Scale: The Changing Face of Compactification
  Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  By studying the effects of the shape moduli associated with toroidal
compactifications, we demonstrate that Planck-sized extra dimensions can cast
significant ``shadows'' over low-energy physics. These shadows can greatly
distort our perceptions of the compactification geometry associated with large
extra dimensions, and place a fundamental limit on our ability to probe the
geometry of compactification simply by measuring Kaluza-Klein states. We also
discuss the interpretation of compactification radii and hierarchies in the
context of geometries with non-trivial shape moduli. One of the main results of
this paper is that compactification geometry is effectively renormalized as a
function of energy scale, with ``renormalization group equations'' describing
the ``flow'' of geometric parameters such as compactification radii and shape
angles as functions of energy.
