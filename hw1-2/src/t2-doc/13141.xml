Integrable aspects of the scaling q-state Potts models II: finite-size
  effects
</title>

<abstract>
  We continue our discussion of the q-state Potts models for q <= 4, in the
scaling regimes close to their critical and tricritical points. In a previous
paper, the spectrum and full S-matrix of the models on an infinite line were
elucidated; here, we consider finite-size behaviour. TBA equations are proposed
for all cases related to phi(21) and phi(12) perturbations of unitary minimal
models. These are subjected to a variety of checks in the ultraviolet and
infrared limits, and compared with results from a recently-proposed nonlinear
integral equation. A nonlinear integral equation is also used to study the
flows from tricritical to critical models, over the full range of q. Our
results should also be of relevance to the study of the off-critical dilute A
models in regimes 1 and 2.
