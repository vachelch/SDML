Macroscopic open strings and gravitational confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider classical solutions for strings ending on magnetically charged
black holes in four-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory. We examine the classical
superstring and the global vortex, which can be viewed as a nonsingular model
for the superstring. We show how both of these can end on a Kaluza-Klein
monopole in the absence of self-gravity. Including gravitational back-reaction
gives rise to a confinement mechanism of the magnetic flux of the black hole
along the direction of the string. We discuss the relation of this work to
localized solutions in ten dimensional supergravity.
