Any compact group is a gauge group

<abstract>
  The assignment of local observables in the vacuum sector, fulfilling the
standard axioms of local quantum theory, is known to determine uniquely a
compact group G of gauge transformations of the first kind together with a
central involutive element k of G, and a complete normal algebra of fields
carrying the localizable charges, on which k defines the Bose/Fermi grading.
 We show here that any such pair {G,k}, where G is compact metrizable, does
actually appear. The corresponding model can be chosen to fulfill also the
split property.
 This is not a dynamical phenomenon: a given {G,k} arises as the gauge group of
a model where the local algebras of observables are a suitable subnet of local
algebras of a possibly infinite product of free field theories.
