Conformally coupled supermultiplets in four and five dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain by superfield methods the exceptional representations of the
OSp(2N/4,R) and SU(2,2/1) superalgebras which extend to supersingletons of
SU(2,2/2N) and F(4), respectively. These representations describe
superconformally coupled multiplets and appear in three- and four-dimensional
superconformal field theories which are holographic descriptions of certain
anti-de Sitter supergravities.
