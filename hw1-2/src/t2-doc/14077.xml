The antiferromagnetic phi4 Model, II. The one-loop renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the four dimensional antiferromagnetic lattice phi4 model
has the usual non-asymptotically free scaling law in the UV regime around the
chiral symmetrical critical point. The theory describes a scalar and a
pseudoscalar particle. A continuum effective theory is derived for low
energies. A possibility of constructing a model with a single chiral boson is
mentioned.
