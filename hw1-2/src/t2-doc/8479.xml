<title>
Classical Geometry and Target Space Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  This is the written version of lectures presented at Cargese 95. A new
formulation for a ``restricted'' type of target space duality in classical two
dimensional nonlinear sigma models is presented. The main idea is summarized by
the analogy: euclidean geometry is to riemannian geometry as toroidal target
space duality is to ``restricted'' target space duality. The target space is
not required to possess symmetry. These lectures only discuss the local theory.
The restricted target space duality problem is identified with an interesting
problem in classical differential geometry.
