Supersymmetric Dyonic Black Holes in Kaluza-Klein Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study supersymmetric, four-dimensional (4-d), Abelian charged black holes
(BH's) arising in (4+n)-d (1 \le n \le 7) Kaluza-Klein (KK) theories. Such
solutions, which satisfy supersymmetric Killing spinor equations (formally
satisfied for any n) and saturate the corresponding Bogomol'nyi bounds, can be
obtained if and only if the isometry group of the internal space is broken down
to the U(1)_E \times U(1)_M gauge group; they correspond to dyonic BH's with
electric Q and magnetic P charges associated with {\it different} U(1) factors.
The internal metric of such configurations is diagonal with (n-2) internal
radii constant, while the remaining two radii (associated with the respective
electric and magnetic U(1) gauge fields) and the 4-d part of the metric turn
out to be independent of n, i.e., solutions are effectively those of
supersymmetric 4-d BH's of 6-d KK theory. For Q \ne 0 and P \ne 0, 4-d
space-time has a null singularity, finite temperature (T_H \propto 1 /
\sqrt{|QP|}) and zero entropy. Special cases with either Q=0 or P=0 correspond
to the supersymmetric 4-d BH's of 5-d KK theory, first derived by Gibbons and
Perry, which have a naked singularity and infinite temperature.
