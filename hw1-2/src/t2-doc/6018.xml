Macroscopic limit of a solvable dynamical model
</title>

<abstract>
  The interaction between an ultrarelativistic particle and a linear array made
up of $N$ two-level systems (^^ ^^ AgBr" molecules) is studied by making use of
a modified version of the Coleman-Hepp Hamiltonian. Energy-exchange processes
between the particle and the molecules are properly taken into account, and the
evolution of the total system is calculated exactly both when the array is
initially in the ground state and in a thermal state. In the macroscopic limit
($N \rightarrow \infty$), the system remains solvable and leads to interesting
connections with the Jaynes-Cummings model, that describes the interaction of a
particle with a maser. The visibility of the interference pattern produced by
the two branch waves of the particle is computed, and the conditions under
which the spin array in the $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit behaves as a ^^ ^^
detector" are investigated. The behavior of the visibility yields good insights
into the issue of quantum measurements: It is found that, in the
thermodynamical limit, a superselection-rule space appears in the description
of the (macroscopic) apparatus. In general, an initial thermal state of the ^^
^^ detector" provokes a more substantial loss of quantum coherence than an
initial ground state. It is argued that a system decoheres more as the
temperature of the detector increases. The problem of ^^ ^^ imperfect
measurements" is also shortly discussed.
