Newtonian Gravitons and D-brane Collective Coordinates in Wound String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently it was shown that NCOS theories are part of a ten-dimensional theory
known as Non-relativistic Wound string theory. We clarify the sense in which
gravity is present in this theory. We show that Wound string theory contains
exceptional unwound strings, including a graviton, which mediate the previously
discovered instantaneous long-range interactions, but are negligible as
asymptotic states. Unwound strings also provide the expected collective
coordinates for the transverse D-branes in the theory. These and other results
are shown to follow both from a direct analysis of the effect of the NCOS limit
on the parent string theory, and from the worldsheet formalism developed by
Gomis and Ooguri, about which we make some additional remarks. We also devote
some attention to supergravity duals, and in particular show that the open and
closed strings of the theory are respectively described by short and long
strings on the supergravity side.
