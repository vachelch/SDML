Orbiting Membranes in M-theory on AdS_7 x S^4 Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We study classical solutions describing rotating and boosted membranes on
AdS_7 x S^4 background in M-theory. We find the dependence of the energy on the
spin and R-charge of these solutions. In the flat space limit we get E ~
S^{2/3}, while for AdS at leading order E-S grows as S^{1/3}. The membranes on
AdS_4 x S^7 background have briefly been studied as well.
