BRST Inner Product Spaces and the Gribov Obstruction
</title>

<abstract>
  A global extension of the Batalin-Marnelius proposal for a BRST inner product
to gauge theories with topologically nontrivial gauge orbits is discussed. It
is shown that their (appropriately adapted) method is applicable to a large
class of mechanical models with a semisimple gauge group in the adjoint and
fundamental representation. This includes cases where the Faddeev-Popov method
fails. Simple models are found also, however, which do not allow for a
well-defined global extension of the Batalin-Marnelius inner product due to a
Gribov obstruction. Reasons for the partial success and failure are worked out
and possible ways to circumvent the problem are briefly discussed.
