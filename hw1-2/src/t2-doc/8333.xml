Exact Results in 5D from Instantons and Deconstruction
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider non-perturbative effects in theories with extra dimensions and
the deconstructed versions of these theories. We establish the rules for
instanton calculations in 5D theories on the circle, and use them for an
explicit one-instanton calculation in a supersymmetric gauge theory. The
results are then compared to the known exact Seiberg-Witten type solution for
this theory, confirming the validity both of the exact results and of the rules
for instanton calculus for extra dimensions introduced here. Next we consider
the non-perturbative results from the perspective of deconstructed extra
dimensions. We show that the non-perturbative results of the deconstructed
theory do indeed reproduce the known results for the continuum extra
dimensional theory, thus providing the first non-perturbative evidence in favor
of deconstruction. This way deconstruction also allows us to make exact
predictions in higher dimensional theories which agree with earlier results,
and helps to clarify the interpretation of 5D instantons.
