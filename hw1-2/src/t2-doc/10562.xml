On QCD_2 from supergravity and mass gaps in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  As a test of the conjectured QCD/supergravity duality, we consider mass gaps
in the supergravity construction of QCD_2. We find a mass gap in the dual field
theory both when using non-rotating and rotating black D2-branes as backgrounds
in the supergravity construction of QCD_2. So, since pure QCD_2 does not have a
mass gap, the dual field theory of the supergravity construction of QCD_2
cannot be pure QCD_2. Considering the mass scales in the dual field theory of
the supergravity construction of QCD_2, we find that this is explainable both
in the case of the non-rotating background and of the rotating background. In
particular, the mass gap in the case of the rotating background can be
explained using results of the large angular momentum limit of euclidean
rotating branes, obtained recently by Cvetic and Gubser. We furthermore remark
on the possible implications for the mass gaps in the supergravity
constructions of QCD_3 and QCD_4.
