Lattice Bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  Fermions on the lattice have bosonic excitations generated from the
underlying periodic background. These, the lattice bosons, arise near the empty
band or when the bands are nearly full. They do not depend on the nature of the
interactions and exist for any fermion-fermion coupling. We discuss these
lattice boson solutions for the Dirac Hamiltonian.
