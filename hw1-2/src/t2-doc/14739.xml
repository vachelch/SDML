Magnetic monopoles in U(1)_4 Lattice Gauge Theory with Wilson action
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the Euclidean Green functions for the soliton (magnetic
monopole) field in the U(1)_4 Lattice Gauge Theory with Wilson action. We show
that in the strong coupling regime there is monopole condensation while in the
QED phase the physical Hilbert space splits into orthogonal soliton sectors
labelled by integer magnetic charge.
