A Note on String Field Theory in the Temporal Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note, we review the recent developments in the string field theory in
the temporal gauge. (Based on a talk presented by N.I. in the workshop {\it
Quantum Field Theory, Integrable Models and Beyond}, Yukawa Institute for
Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University, 14-18 February 1994.)
