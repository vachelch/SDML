Confinement potential in dual Monopole Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with
  dual Dirac strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Interquark confinement potential is calculated in the dual Monopole
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with dual Dirac strings as a functional of a dual
Dirac string length. The calculation is carried out by the explicit integration
over quantum fluctuations of a dual-vector field (monopole-antimonopole
collective excitation) around the Abrikosov flux line and string shape
fluctuations. The contribution of the scalar field (monopole-antimonopole
collective excitation) exchange is taken into account in the tree approximation
due to the London limit regime.
