Folding transition of the triangular lattice in a discrete
  three--dimensional space

<abstract>
  A vertex model introduced by M. Bowick, P. Di Francesco, O. Golinelli, and E.
Guitter (cond-mat/9502063) describing the folding of the triangular lattice
onto the face centered cubic lattice has been studied in the hexagon
approximation of the cluster variation method. The model describes the
behaviour of a polymerized membrane in a discrete three--dimensional space. We
have introduced a curvature energy and a symmetry breaking field and studied
the phase diagram of the resulting model. By varying the curvature energy
parameter, a first-order transition has been found between a flat and a folded
phase for any value of the symmetry breaking field.
