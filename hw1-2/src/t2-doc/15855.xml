Sewing string tree vertices using canonical forms
</title>

<abstract>
  We effectively sew two vertices with ghosts in order to obtain a third,
composite vertex in the most general case of cycling transformations. In order
to do this, we separate the vertices into two parts: a bosonic oscillator part
and a ghost oscillator part and write them as canonical forms.
