Bulk Quantization of Gauge Theories: Confined and Higgs Phases
</title>

<abstract>
  We deepen the understanding of the quantization of the Yang-Mills field by
showing that the concept of gauge fixing in 4 dimensions is replaced in the
5-dimensional formulation by a procedure that amounts to an $A$-dependent gauge
transformation. The 5-dimensional formulation implements the restriction of the
physical 4-dimensional gluon field to the Gribov region, while being a local
description that is under control of BRST symmetries both of topological and
gauge type. The ghosts decouple so the Euclidean probability density is
everywhere positive, in contradistinction to the Faddeev-Popov method for
which the determinant changes sign outside the Gribov region. We include in our
discussion the coupling of the gauge theory to a Higgs field, including the
case of spontaneously symmetry breaking. We introduce a minimizing functional
on the gauge orbit that could be of interest for numerical gauge fixing in the
simulations of spontaneously broken lattice gauge theories. Other new results
are displayed, such as the identification of the Schwinger-Dyson equation of
the five dimensional formulation in the (singular) Landau gauge with that of
the ordinary Faddeev-Popov formulation, order by order in perturbation theory.
