  The conventional path integral expression for the Yang-Mills transition
amplitude with flat measure and gauge-fixing built in via the Faddeev-Popov
method has been claimed to fall short of guaranteeing gauge invariance in the
non-perturbative regime. We show, however, that it yields the gauge invariant
partition function where the projection onto gauge invariant wave functions is
explicitly performed by integrating over the compact gauge group. In a variant
of maximal Abelian gauge the Haar measure arises in the conventional Yang-Mills
path integral from the Faddeev-Popov determinant.
