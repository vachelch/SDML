``Induced'' Super-Symmetry Breaking with a Vanishing Vacuum Energy
</title>

<abstract>
  A new mechanism for symmetry breaking is proposed which naturally avoids the
constraints following from the usual theorems of symmetry breaking. In the
context of super-symmetry, for example, the breaking may be consistent with a
vanishing vacuum energy. A 2+1 dimensional super-symmetric gauge field theory
is explicitly shown to break super-symmetry through this mechanism while
maintaining a zero vacuum energy. This mechanism may provide a solution to two
long standing problems, namely, dynamical super-symmetry breaking and the
cosmological constant problem.
