Fivebranes Wrapped On Associative Three-Cycles
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct supergravity solutions corresponding to fivebranes wrapping
associative three-cycles of constant curvature in manifolds of G_2-holonomy.
The solutions preserve 2 supercharges and are first constructed in D=7 gauged
supergravity and then lifted to D=10,11. We show that the low-energy theory of
M-fivebranes wrapped on a compact hyperbolic three-space is dual to a
superconformal field theory in D=3 by exhibiting a flow to an AdS_4 region. For
IIB-fivebranes wrapped on a three-sphere we speculate on a connection with
spontaneous supersymmetry breaking of pure N=1 super Yang-Mills theory in D=3.
