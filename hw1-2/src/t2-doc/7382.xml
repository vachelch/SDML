F-Theories on Double Sextics and Effective String Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct new F-theory vacua in 8-dimensions. They are coming by
projective realizations of F-theory on $K_3$ surfaces admitting double covers
onto $\P^2$, branched along a plane sextic curve, the so called double sextics.
The new vacua are associated with singular $K_3$ surfaces. In this way the
stable picture of the heterotic string is mapped at the triple points of the
sextic. We argue that this formulation naturally incorporates the $Sp(4,Z)$
invariance that the extrapolating four dimensional vector multiplet sector of
all heterotic vacua may possess. In addition, we describe the way that the 4D
g=2 description of (0,2) moduli dependence of N=1 gauge coupling constants may
be connected to Riemann surfaces, with natural Sp(4,Z) duality invarinace. Here
we recover a novel way to break space-time supersymmetry and fix the moduli
parameters in the presence of Wilson lines. In the context of arithmetic of
torsion points on elliptic curves, we describe in detail, the derivation of
elliptic fibrations in Weierstrass form. We also consider the heterotic duals
to compactifications of F-theory in four dimensions belonging to isomorphic
classes of elliptic curves with point-cusps of order two. For the latter
theories, we calculate the $\cal N}=2$ 4D heterotic prepotential $f_{TTT}$
corresponding to ${\Gamma_o(2)}_T \times {\Gamma_o(2)}_U$, classical
perturbative duality group, and their conjugate modular theories.
