Quaternionic Electroweak Theory and CKM Matrix
</title>

<abstract>
  We find in our quaternionic version of the electroweak theory an apparently
hopeless problem: In going from complex to quaternions, the calculation of the
real-valued parameters of the CKM matrix drastically changes. We aim to explain
this quaternionic puzzle.
