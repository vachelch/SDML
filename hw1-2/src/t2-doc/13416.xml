Polynomial Identities, Indices, and Duality for the N=1 Superconformal
  Model SM(2,4\nu)
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove polynomial identities for the N=1 superconformal model SM(2,4\nu)
which generalize and extend the known Fermi/Bose character identities. Our
proof uses the q-trinomial coefficients of Andrews and Baxter on the bosonic
side and a recently introduced very general method of producing recursion
relations for q-series on the fermionic side. We use these polynomials to
demonstrate a dual relation under q \rightarrow q^{-1} between SM(2,4\nu) and
M(2\nu-1,4\nu). We also introduce a generalization of the Witten index which is
expressible in terms of the Rogers false theta functions.
