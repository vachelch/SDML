Matrix Theory Compactification on Noncommutative $T^4/Z_2$
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we construct gauge bundles on a noncommutative toroidal
orbifold $T^4_\theta/Z_2$. First, we explicitly construct a bundle with
constant curvature connections on a noncommutative $T^4_\theta$ following
Rieffel's method. Then, applying the appropriate quotient conditions for its
$Z_2$ orbifold, we find a Connes-Douglas-Schwarz type solution of matrix theory
compactified on $T^4_\theta/Z_2$. When we consider two copies of a bundle on
$T^4_\theta$ invariant under the $Z_2$ action, the resulting Higgs branch
moduli space of equivariant constant curvature connections becomes an ordinary
toroidal orbifold $T^4/Z_2$.
