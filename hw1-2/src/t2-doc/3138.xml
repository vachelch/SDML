Generalized parity transformations in lattice Chern-Simons theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Regularization modifies the (odd) behaviour of the Abelian Chern-Simons
action under parity. This effect happens for any sensible regularization; in
particular, on the lattice. However, as in the chiral symmetry case, there
exist generalized parity transformations such that the regularized theory is
odd, and the corresponding operator verifies a Ginsparg-Wilson like relation.
We present a derivation of such a relation and of the corresponding symmetry
transformations.
