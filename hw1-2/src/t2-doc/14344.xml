Non-Abelian Monopoles Coupled to Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A static configuration of point charges held together by the gravitational
attraction is known to be given by the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution in the
Einstein-Maxwell theory. We consider a generalization of this solution to
non-Abelian monopoles of the Yang-Mills Higgs system coupled to gravity. The
solution is governed by an analog of the Bogomol'nyi equations that had played
a central role in the analysis of non-Abelian monopoles.
