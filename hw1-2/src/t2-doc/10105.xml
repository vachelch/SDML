SU(2) WZW D-branes and quantized worldvolume U(1) flux on S^2
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss possible D-brane configurations on SU(2) group manifolds in the
sigma model approach. When we turn the boundary conditions of the spacetime
fields into the boundary gluing conditions of chiral currents, we find that for
all D-branes except the spherical D2-branes, the gluing matrices R^a_{b} depend
on the fields, so the chiral Kac-Moody symmetry is broken, but conformal
symmetry is maintained. Matching the spherical D2-branes derived from the sigma
model with those from the boundary state approach we obtain a U(1) field
strength that is consistent with flux quantization.
