Spin Singlet Quantum Hall Effect and Nonabelian Landau-Ginzburg Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we present a theory of Singlet Quantum Hall Effect (SQHE). We
show that the Halperin-Haldane SQHE wave function can be written in the form of
a product of a wave function for charged semions in a magnetic field and a wave
function for the Chiral Spin Liquid of neutral spin-$\12$ semions. We introduce
field-theoretic model in which the electron operators are factorized in terms
of charged spinless semions (holons) and neutral spin-$\12$ semions (spinons).
Broken time reversal symmetry and short ranged spin correlations lead to
$SU(2)_{k=1}$ Chern-Simons term in Landau-Ginzburg action for SQHE phase. We
construct appropriate coherent states for SQHE phase and show the existence of
$SU(2)$ valued gauge potential. This potential appears as a result of ``spin
rigidity" of the ground state against any displacements of nodes of wave
function from positions of the particles and reflects the nontrivial monodromy
in the presence of these displacements.
