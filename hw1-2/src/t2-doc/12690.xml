Non-Relativistic Closed String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a Galilean invariant non-gravitational closed string theory
whose excitations satisfy a non-relativistic dispersion relation. This theory
can be obtained by taking a consistent low energy limit of any of the
conventional string theories, including the heterotic string. We give a finite
first order worldsheet Hamiltonian for this theory and show that this string
theory has a sensible perturbative expansion, interesting high energy behavior
of scattering amplitudes and a Hagedorn transition of the thermal ensemble. The
strong coupling duals of the Galilean superstring theories are considered and
are shown to be described by an eleven-dimensional Galilean invariant theory of
light membrane fluctuations. A new class of Galilean invariant
non-gravitational theories of light-brane excitations are obtained. We exhibit
dual formulations of the strong coupling limits of these Galilean invariant
theories and show that they exhibit many of the conventional dualities of M
theory in a non-relativistic setting.
