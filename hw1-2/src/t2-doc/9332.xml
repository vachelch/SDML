TBA and TCSA with boundaries and excited states

<abstract>
  We study the spectrum of the scaling Lee-Yang model on a finite interval from
two points of view: via a generalisation of the truncated conformal space
approach to systems with boundaries, and via the boundary thermodynamic Bethe
ansatz. This allows reflection factors to be matched with specific boundary
conditions, and leads us to propose a new (and non-minimal) family of
reflection factors to describe the one relevant boundary perturbation in the
model. The equations proposed previously for the ground state on an interval
must be revised in certain regimes, and we find the necessary modifications by
analytic continuation. We also propose new equations to describe excited
states, and check all equations against boundary truncated conformal space
data. Access to the finite-size spectrum enables us to observe boundary flows
when the bulk remains massless, and the formation of boundary bound states when
the bulk is massive.
