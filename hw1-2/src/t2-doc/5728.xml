Spacetime-Filling Branes and Strings with Sixteen Supercharges
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss branes whose worldvolume dimension equals the target spacetime
dimension, i.e. ``spacetime-filling branes''. In addition to the D9-branes,
there are 9-branes in the NS-NS sectors of both the IIA and IIB strings. The
worldvolume actions of these branes are constructed, via duality, from the
known actions of branes with codimension larger than zero. Each of these types
of branes is used in the construction of a string theory with sixteen
supercharges by modding out a type II string by an appropriate discrete
symmetry and adding 32 9-branes. These constructions are related by a web of
dualities and each arises as a different limit of the Horava-Witten
construction.
