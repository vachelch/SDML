Light-Front QCD: Role of Longitudinal Boundary Integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  In the canonical light-front QCD, the elimination of unphysical gauge degrees
of freedom leads to a set of boundary integrals which are associated with the
light-front infrared singularity. We find that a consistent treatment of the
boundary integrals leads to the cancellation of the light-front linear infrared
divergences. For physical states, the requirement of finite energy density in
the light-front gauge $(A_a^+=0)$ results in equations which determine the
asymptotic behavior of the transverse (physical) gauge degrees of freedom at
longitudinal infinity. These asymptotic fields are generated by the boundary
integrals and they are responsible for the topological winding number. They
also involve non-local behavior in the transverse direction that leads to
non-local forces.
