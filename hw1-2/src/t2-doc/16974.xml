Supergravity duals of gauge theories from F(4) gauged supergravity in
  six dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct supergravity solutions dual to twisted field theories that are
the worldvolume theories of D4-branes wrapped on 2, 3-cycles, and NS-fivebranes
on 3-cycles. We first obtain the solutions for the Romans' six-dimensional
gauged supergravity theories and then up-lift them to ten dimensions. In
particular, we find solutions for field configurations with either non-Abelian
fields or B-fields being excited. One of these solutions, in the massless case,
is up-lifted to the massless type IIA string theory. This is the first example
of such a kind. The cases studied provide new examples of the AdS/CFT duality
involving twisted field theories.
