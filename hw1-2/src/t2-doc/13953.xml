Physical States in Matter-Coupled Dilaton Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We revisit the quantization of matter-coupled, two-dimensional dilaton
gravity. At the classical level and with a cosmological term, a series of field
transformations leads to a set of free fields of indefinite signature. Without
matter the system is represented by two scalar fields of opposite signature.
With a particular quantization for the scalar with negative kinetic energy, the
system has zero central charge and we find some physical states satisfying {\it
all} the Virasoro conditions. With matter, the constraints cannot be solved
because of the Virasoro anomaly. We discuss two avenues for consistent
quantization: modification of the constraints, and BRST quantization. The first
avenue appears to lead to very few physical states. The second, which roughly
corresponds to satisfying half of the Virasoro conditions, results in a rich
spectrum of physical states. This spectrum, however, differs significantly from
that of free matter fields propagating on flat two-dimensional space-time.
