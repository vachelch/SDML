Gravitationally dresed RG flows and zig-zag invariant strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a world-sheet realization of the zigzag-invariant bosonic and
fermionic strings as a perturbed Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model at large
negative level $k$ on a group manifold $G$ coupled to 2D gravity. In the large
$k$ limit the zigzag symmetry can be obtained as a result of a self-consistent
solution of the gravitationally dressed RG equation. The only solution found
for simple group is $G=SL(2)$. More general target-space geometries can be
obtained via tensoring of various cosets based on SL(2). In the supersymmetric
case the zigzag symmetry fixes the maximal target-space dimension of the
confining fermionic string to be seven.
