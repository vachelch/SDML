Global Aspects of p-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize to dimension $p>1$ the notion of string structure and discuss
the related obstruction. We apply our results to a model of bosonic $p$-branes
propagating on a principal $G$-bundle, coupled to a Yang--Mills field and an
antisymmetric tensor field and in the presence of a Wess-Zumino term in the
Lagrangian. We construct the quantization line bundle and discuss the action of
background gauge transformations on wave functions.
