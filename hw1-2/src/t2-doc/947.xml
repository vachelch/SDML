A remark on the numerical validation of triviality for scalar field
  theories using high-temperature expansions
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a simple modification of the usual procedures of analysis for the
high-temperature (strong-coupling or hopping-parameter) expansions of the
renormalized four-point coupling constant in the fourdimensional phi^4 lattice
scalar field theory. As a result we can more convincingly validate numerically
the triviality of the continuum limit taken from the high temperature phase.
