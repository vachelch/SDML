q-deformed Dirac Monopole With Arbitrary Charge
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the deformed Dirac monopole on the quantum sphere for arbitrary
charge using two different methods and show that it is a quantum principal
bundle in the sense of Brzezinski and Majid. We also give a connection and
calculate the analog of its Chern number by integrating the curvature over
$S^2_q$.
