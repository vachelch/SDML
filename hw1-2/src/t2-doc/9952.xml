Polynomial Algebras and Higher Spins

<abstract>
  Polynomial relations for generators of $su(2)$ Lie algebra in arbitrary
representations are found. They generalize usual relation for Pauli operators
in spin 1/2 case and permit to construct modified Holstein-Primakoff
transformations in finite dimensional Fock spaces. The connection between
$su(2)$ Lie algebra and q-oscillators with a root of unity q-parameter is
considered. The meaning of the polynomial relations from the point of view of
quantum mechanics on a sphere are discussed.
