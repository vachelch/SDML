Four - Point Functions of Chiral Primary Operators in N=4 SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss recent progress in the determination of correlators of chiral
primary operators in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory, based on a combination of
superconformal covariance arguments in N=2 harmonic superspace, and
Intriligator's insertion formula. Applying this technique to the calculation of
the supercurrent four - point function we obtain a compact and explicit result
for its three-loop contribution with comparatively little effort.
