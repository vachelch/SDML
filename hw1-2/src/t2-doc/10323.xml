$q$-Deformed Classical Lie Algebras and their Anyonic Realization
</title>

<abstract>
  All classical Lie algebras can be realized \`a la Schwinger in terms of
fermionic oscillators. We show that the same can be done for their $q$-deformed
counterparts by simply replacing the fermionic oscillators with anyonic ones
defined on a two dimensional lattice. The deformation parameter $q$ is a phase
related to the anyonic statistical parameter. A crucial r\^ole in this
construction is played by a sort of bosonization formula which gives the
generators of the quantum algebras in terms of the underformed ones. The entire
procedure works even on one dimensional chains; in such a case $q$ can also be
real.
