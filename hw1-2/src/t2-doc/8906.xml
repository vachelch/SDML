Nonabelian Topological Mass Generation in 4 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the topological mass generation in the 4 dimensional nonabelian
gauge theory, which is the extension of the Allen $et$ $al.$'s work in the
abelian theory. It is crucial to introduce a one form auxiliary field in
constructing the gauge invariant nonabelian action which contains both the one
form vector gauge field $A$ and the two form antisymmetric tensor field $B$. As
in the abelian case, the topological coupling $m B\wedge F$, where $F$ is the
field strength of $A$, makes the transmutation among $A$ and $B$ possible, and
consequently we see that the gauge field becomes massive. We find the
BRST/anti-BRST transformation rule using the horizontality condition, and
construct a BRST/anti-BRST invariant quantum action.
