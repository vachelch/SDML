Negative dimensional group extrapolation and dualities in N = 1
  supersymmetric gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that the similarities in N = 1 supersymmetric SO, SP gauge
theories can be explained by using the trick of extrapolating the groups to the
negative dimensions. One of the advantages of this trick is that anomaly
matching is automatically satisfied.
