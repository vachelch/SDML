Brane - Antibrane as a Defect of Tachyon Condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  In a tachyon effective field theory of a non-BPS brane, we construct a
classical solution representing a parallel brane-antibrane. The solution is
made of a kink and an antikink placed at antipodal points of S^1. Estimation of
the brane energy suggests an excitation of a string connecting the two branes,
even though the theory is Abelian. We performed fluctuation analysis around the
obtained solution, and find the structure of the supersymmetry breaking by the
co-existence of the brane and the antibrane. We discuss possible processes of
the pair-annihilation of the brane defect.
