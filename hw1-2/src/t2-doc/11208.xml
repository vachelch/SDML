Five-Dimensional Gauged Supergravities with Universal Hypermultiplet and
  Warped Brane Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present five dimensional gauged supergravity with universal hypermultiplet
on M_4 \times S^1 / Z_2 coupled supersymmetrically to three-branes located at
the fixed points. The construction is extended to the smooth picture with
auxiliary singlet and four-form fields. The model admits the Randall-Sundrum
solution as a BPS vacuum with vanishing energy. We give the form of all
KK-tower modes for fields present in the model.
