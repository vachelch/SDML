Moduli and K\"ahler potential in fermionic strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the problem of identifying the moduli fields in fermionic
four-dimensional string models. We deform a free-fermionic model by introducing
exactly marginal operators in the form of Abelian Thirring interactions on the
world-sheet, and show that their couplings correspond to the untwisted moduli
fields. We study the consequences of this method for simple free-fermionic
models which correspond to $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifolds and obtain their moduli
space and K\"ahler potential by symmetry arguments and by direct calculation of
string scattering amplitudes. We then generalize our analysis to more
complicated fermionic structures which arise in constructions of realistic
models corresponding to asymmetric orbifolds, and obtain the moduli space and
K\"ahler potential for this case. Finally we extend our analysis to the
untwisted matter sector and derive expressions for the full K\"ahler potential
to be used in phenomenological applications, and the target space duality
transformations of the corresponding untwisted matter fields.
