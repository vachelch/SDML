Black Diamonds at Brane Junctions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the properties of black holes in brane-world scenarios where our
universe is viewed as a four-dimensional sub-manifold of some
higher-dimensional spacetime. We consider in detail such a model where
four-dimensional spacetime lies at the junction of several domain walls in a
higher dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In this model there may be any
number p of infinitely large extra dimensions transverse to the brane-world. We
present an exact solution describing a black p-brane which will induce on the
brane-world the Schwarzschild solution. This exact solution is unstable to the
Gregory-Laflamme instability, whereby long-wavelength perturbations cause the
extended horizon to fragment. We therefore argue that at late times a
non-rotating uncharged black hole in the brane-world is described by a deformed
event horizon in p+4 dimensions which will induce, to good approximation, the
Schwarzschild solution in the four-dimensional brane world. When p=2, this
deformed horizon resembles a black diamond and more generally for p>2, a
polyhedron.
