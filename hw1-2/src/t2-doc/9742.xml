A perturbative re-analysis of N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory

<abstract>
  The finiteness properties of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are
reanalyzed both in the component formulation and using N=1 superfields, in
order to discuss some subtleties that emerge in the computation of gauge
dependent quantities. The one-loop corrections to various Green functions of
elementary fields are calculated. In the component formulation it is shown that
the choice of the Wess-Zumino gauge, that is standard in supersymmetric gauge
theories, introduces ultraviolet divergences in the propagators at the one-loop
level. Such divergences are exactly cancelled when the contributions of the
fields that are put to zero in the Wess-Zumino gauge are taken into account. In
the description in terms of N=1 superfields infrared divergences are found for
every choice of gauge different from the supersymmetric generalization of the
Fermi-Feynman gauge. Two-, three- and four-point functions of N=1 superfields
are computed and some general features of the infrared problem are discussed.
We also examine the effect of the introduction of mass terms for the (anti)
chiral superfields in the theory, which break supersymmetry from N=4 to N=1. It
is shown that in the mass deformed model no ultraviolet divergences appear in
two-point functions. It argued that this result can be generalized to n-point
functions, supporting the proposal of a possible of use of this modified model
as a supersymmetry-preserving regularization scheme for N=1 theories.
