Ground State of Supermembrane on PP-wave
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the ground state of supermembrane on the maximally supersymmetric
pp-wave background by using the quantum-mechanical procedure of de
Wit-Hoppe-Nicolai. In the pp-wave case the ground state has non-trivial
structure even in the zero-mode Hamiltonian, which is identical with that of
superparticles on the pp-wave and resembles supersymmetric harmonic
oscillators. The supergravity multiplet in the flat case is splitting with a
certain energy difference. We explicitly construct the unique supersymmetric
ground-state wave function of the zero-mode Hamiltonian, which is obviously
normalizable. Moreover, we discuss the nonzero-mode Hamiltonian and construct
an example for the ground-state wave function with a truncation of the
variables. This special solution seems non-normalizable but its L^2-norm can be
represented by an asymptotic series.
