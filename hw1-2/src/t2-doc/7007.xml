Quantum Metamorphosis of Conformal Transformation in D3-Brane Yang-Mills
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the linear special conformal transformation in four-dimensional
N=4 super Yang-Mills theory is metamorphosed into the nonlinear and
field-dependent transformation for the collective coordinates of Dirichlet
3-branes, which agrees with the transformation law for the space-time
coordinates in the anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. Our result provides a new
and strong support for the conjectured relation between AdS supergravity and
super conformal Yang-Mills theory (SYM). Furthermore, our work sheds
elucidating light on the nature of the AdS/SYM correspondence.
