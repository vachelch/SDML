The Zeeman Effect for the Relativistic Bound State
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of a relativistic quantum mechanics with invariant evolution
parameter, solutions for the relativistic bound state problem have been found,
which yield a spectrum for the total mass coinciding with the nonrelativistic
Schr\"odinger energy spectrum. These spectra were obtained by choosing an
arbitrary spacelike unit vector $n_\mu$ and restricting the support of the
eigenfunctions in spacetime to the subspace of the Minkowski measure space, for
which $(x_\perp )^2 = [x-(x \cdot n) n ]^2 \geq 0$. In this paper, we examine
the Zeeman effect for these bound states, which requires $n_\mu$ to be a
dynamical quantity. We recover the usual Zeeman splitting in a manifestly
covariant form.
