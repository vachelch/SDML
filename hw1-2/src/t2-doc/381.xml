Heterotic M-Theory Cosmology in Four and Five Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study rolling radii solutions in the context of the four- and
five-dimensional effective actions of heterotic M-theory. For the standard
four-dimensional solutions with varying dilaton and T-modulus, we find
approximate five-dimensional counterparts. These are new, generically
non-separating solutions corresponding to a pair of five-dimensional domain
walls evolving in time. Loop corrections in the four-dimensional theory are
described by certain excitations of fields in the fifth dimension. We point out
that the two exact separable solutions previously discovered are precisely the
special cases for which the loop corrections are time-independent. Generically,
loop corrections vary with time. Moreover, for a subset of solutions they
increase in time, evolving into complicated, non-separating solutions. In this
paper we compute these solutions to leading, non-trivial order. Using the
equations for the induced brane metric, we present a general argument showing
that the accelerating backgrounds of this type cannot evolve smoothly into
decelerating backgrounds.
