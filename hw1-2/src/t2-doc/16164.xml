The Coulomb Branch of N=2 Supersymmetric Product Group Theories from
  Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We determine the low energy description of N=2 supersymmetric SU(k) product
group theories with bifundamental and fundamental matter based on M-theory
fivebrane configurations. The dependence on moduli and scales of the
coefficients in the non-hyperelliptic Seiberg-Witten curves for these theories
is determined by considering various field theory and brane limits. A
peculiarity in the interpretation of these curves for the vanishing
beta-function case is noted.
