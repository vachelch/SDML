Intersecting M-Fluxbranes
</title>

<abstract>
  New solution to the six-dimensional vacuum Einstein's equations is
constructed as a non-linear superposition of two five-dimensional solutions
representing the Melvin-Gibbons-Maeda Universe and its S-dual. Then using
duality between D=8 vacuum and a certain class of D=11 supergravity
configurations we generate M2 and M5 fluxbranes as well as some of their
intersections also including waves and KK-monopoles.
