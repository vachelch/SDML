New Theories With Quantum Modified Moduli Space
</title>

<abstract>
  Kutasov--type duals of supersymmetric gauge theories had been studied only in
the dual regime and the s-confining case. Here we extend the discussion to the
case of less flavor, analogous to the case of quantum-modified moduli space in
Seiberg duality. Unlike the Seiberg duality, however, we find that parts of the
moduli space become superconformal, generalizing the so far isolated example of
SU(2) theory with two doublets and a triplet. We also point out that the
magnetic superpotential needs to be augmented by an additional
instanton-generated piece when the magnetic group is SU(2).
