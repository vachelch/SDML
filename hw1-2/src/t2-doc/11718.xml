Open Superstring Theory and Superalgebra of the Brane Antibrane System
</title>

<abstract>
  Open superstring theory is formulated in terms of a nondegenerate
supertranslation algebra. A supercharge for a tachyonic superstring can be also
defined classically by taking into account the leakage of the supercurrent
which is compensated by fermionic and bosonic auxiliary fields. The
anticommutator of two supercharges of the tachyonic superstring does not
contain the zero eigenvalue and so this string is not a BPS state.
Brane-antibrane annihilation scenarios are described by these superalgebras
defined on the sum of world-volumes of a D-brane, an anti-D-brane and a
tachyonic superstring.
