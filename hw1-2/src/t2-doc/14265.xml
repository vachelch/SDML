Wave-function renormalization for the Coulomb-gas in Wegner-Houghton's
  RG method
</title>

<abstract>
  The RG flow for the sine-Gordon model is determined by means of the method of
Wegner and Houghton in next-to-leading order of the derivative expansion. For
small values of the fugacity this agrees with the well-known RG flow of the
two-dimensional Coulomb-gas found in the dilute gas approximation and a
systematic way of obtaining higher-order corrections to this approximation is
given.
