Topological Sigma-Models in Four Dimensions and Triholomorphic Maps
</title>

<abstract>
  It is well-known that topological sigma-models in 2 dimensions constitute a
path-integral approach to the study of holomorphic maps from a Riemann surface
S to an almost complex manifold K, the most interesting case being that where K
is a Kahler manifold. We show that, in the same way, topological sigma-models
in 4 dimensions introduce a path integral approach to the study of
triholomorphic maps q:M-->N from a 4dimensional Riemannian manifold M to an
almost quaternionic manifold N. The most interesting cases are those where M, N
are hyperKahler or quaternionic Kahler. BRST-cohomology translates into
intersection theory in the moduli-space of this new class of instantonic maps,
named by us hyperinstantons. The definition of triholomorphicity that we
propose is expressed by the equation q_*-J_u q_* j_u = 0, u=1,2,3, where {j_u}
is an almost quaternionic structure on M and {J_u} is an almost quaternionic
structure on N. This is a generalization of the Cauchy-Fueter equations. For M,
N hyperKahler, this generalization naturally arises by obtaining the
topological sigma-model as a twisted version of the N=2 globally supersymmetric
sigma-model. We discuss various examples of hyperinstantons, in particular on
the torus and the K3 surface. We also analyse the coupling of the topological
sigma-model to topological gravity. The study of
