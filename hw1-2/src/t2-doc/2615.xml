Yang-Mills Instantons in the Large-N Limit and the AdS/CFT
  Correspondence

<abstract>
  We examine a certain 16-fermion correlator in {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric SU(N)
gauge theory in 4 dimensions. Generalizing recent SU(2) results of Bianchi,
Green, Kovacs and Rossi, we calculate the exact N-dependence of the effective
16-fermion vertex at the 1-instanton level, and find precise agreement in the
large-N limit with the prediction of the type IIB superstring on AdS_5 x S^5.
This suggests that the string theory prediction for the 1-instanton amplitude
considered here is not corrected by higher-order terms in the alpha' expansion.
