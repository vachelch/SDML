Gauged NJL model at strong curvature
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the gauged NJL--model in curved spacetime using the RG
formulation and the equivalency with the gauge Higgs--Yukawa model in a
modified 1/N_c -expansion. The strong curvature induced chiral symmetry
breaking is found in the non-perturbative RG approach (presumably equivalent to
the ladder Schwinger--Dyson equations). Dynamically generated fermion mass is
explicitly calculated and inducing of Einstein gravity is briefly discussed.
This approach shows the way to the non-perturbative study of the dynamical
symmetry breaking at external fields.
