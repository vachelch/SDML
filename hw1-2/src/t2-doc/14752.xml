Exploring de Sitter Space and Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore aspects of the physics of de Sitter (dS) space that are relevant
to holography with a positive cosmological constant. First we display a
nonlocal map that commutes with the de Sitter isometries, transforms the
bulk-boundary propagator and solutions of free wave equations in de Sitter onto
the same quantities in Euclidean anti-de Sitter (EAdS), and takes the two
boundaries of dS to the single EAdS boundary via an antipodal identification.
Second we compute the action of scalar fields on dS as a functional of boundary
data. Third, we display a family of solutions to 3d gravity with a positive
cosmological constant in which the equal time sections are arbitrary genus
Riemann surfaces, and compute the action of these spaces as a functional of
boundary data from the Einstein gravity and Chern-Simons gravity points of
view. These studies suggest that if de Sitter space is dual to a Euclidean
conformal field theory (CFT), this theory should involve two disjoint, but
possibly entangled factors. We argue that these CFTs would be of a novel form,
with unusual hermiticity conditions relating left movers and right movers.
After exploring these conditions in a toy model, we combine our observations to
propose that a holographic dual description of de Sitter space would involve a
pure entangled state in a product of two of our unconventional CFTs associated
with the de Sitter boundaries. This state can be constructed to preserve the de
Sitter symmetries and and its decomposition in a basis appropriate to antipodal
inertial observers would lead to the thermal properties of static patch.
