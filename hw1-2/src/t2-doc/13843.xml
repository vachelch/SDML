Hamiltonian Reduction and Supersymmetric Toda Models
</title>

<abstract>
  New formulations of the solutions of N=1 and N=2 super Toda field theory are
introduced, using Hamiltonian Reduction of the N=1 and N=2 super WZNW Models to
the super Toda Models. These parameterisations are then used to present the
Hamiltonian formulations of the super Toda theories on the spaces of solutions.
