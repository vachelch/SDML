Static spherically symmetric monopole solutions in the presence of a
  dilaton field
</title>

<abstract>
  A numerical study of static spherically symmetric monople solutions of a
spontaneously broken SU(2) gauge theory coupled to a dilaton field is
presented. Regular solutions seem to exist only up to a maximal value of the
dilaton coupling. In addition to the generalization of the 't Hooft-Polyakov
monopole a discrete family of regular solutions is found, corresponding to
radial excitations, absent in the theory without dilaton.
