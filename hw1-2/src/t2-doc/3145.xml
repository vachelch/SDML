Quantum Field Theory Without Divergence A

<abstract>
  On the basis a new conjecture, we present a new Lagrangian density and a new
quantization method for QED, construct coupling operators and mass operators,
derive scattering operators S_{f} and S_{w} which are dependent on each other
and supplement new Feynman rules. S_{f} and S_{w} together determine a Fenman
integral. Hence all Feynman integrals are convergent and it is unnecessary to
introduce regularization and counterterms. That the energy of the vacuum state
is equal to zero is naturally obtained. From this we can easily determine the
cosmological constant according to data of astronomical observation, and it is
possible to correct nonperturbational methods which depend on the energy of the
ground state in quantum field theory. On the same basis as the new QED, we
obtain naturally a new SU(2)XU(1) electroweak unified model whose L=L_{F}+L_{W}
, here L is left-right symmetric. Thus the world is left-right symmetric in
principle, but the part observed by us is asymmetric because L_{W} and L_{F}
are all asymmetic. This model do not contain any unknown particle with a
massive mass. A conjecture that there is repulsion or gravitation between the
W-particles and the F-particles is presented. If the new interaction is
gravitation, W-matter is the candidate for dark matter. If the new interaction
is repulsion, W-matter is the origin of universe expansion.
