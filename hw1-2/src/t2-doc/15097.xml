Classification of Two Dimensional N=4 Superconformal Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  Classification of N=4 superconformal symmetries in two dimensions is
re-examined. It is proposed that apart from SU(2) and $SU(2)\times SU(2)\times
U(1)$ their Kac-Moody symmetry can also be $SU(2)\times(U(1))^4$. These
superconformal symmetries and corresponding algebras are named small, large and
middle ones respectively. Operator product expansions for the middle algebra
are derived. Complete free field realizations of large and middle
superconformal symmetries are obtained.
