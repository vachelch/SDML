Intertwiners and \ade Lattice Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Intertwiners between \ade lattice models are presented and the general theory
developed. The intertwiners are discussed at three levels: at the level of the
adjacency matrices, at the level of the cell calculus intertwining the face
algebras and at the level of the row transfer matrices. A convenient graphical
representation of the intertwining cells is introduced. The utility of the
intertwining relations in studying the spectra of the \ade models is
emphasized. In particular, it is shown that the existence of an intertwiner
implies that many eigenvalues of the \ade row transfer matrices are exactly in
common for a finite system and, consequently, that the corresponding central
charges and scaling dimensions can be identified.
