Unitary Supermultiplets of OSp(8^*|4) and the AdS_7/CFT_6 Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the unitary supermultiplets of the N=4 d=7 anti-de Sitter (AdS_7)
superalgebra OSp(8^*|4), with the even subalgebra SO(6,2) X USp(4), which is
the symmetry superalgebra of M-theory on AdS_7 X S^4. We give a complete
classification of the positive energy doubleton and massless supermultiplets of
OSp(8^*|4) . The ultra-short doubleton supermultiplets do not have a
Poincar\'{e} limit in AdS_7 and correspond to superconformal field theories on
the boundary of AdS_7 which can be identified with d=6 Minkowski space. We show
that the six dimensional Poincare mass operator vanishes identically for the
doubleton representations. By going from the compact U(4) basis of
SO^*(8)=SO(6,2) to the noncompact basis SU^*(4)XD (d=6 Lorentz group times
dilatations) one can associate the positive (conformal) energy representations
of SO^*(8) with conformal fields transforming covariantly under the Lorentz
group in d=6. The oscillator method used for the construction of the unitary
supermultiplets of OSp(8^*|4) can be given a dynamical realization in terms of
chiral super-twistor fields.
