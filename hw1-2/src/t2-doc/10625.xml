Schwinger-Dyson Equations in 2D Induced Gravity in Covariant Gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the ladder approximation for 2D
induced quantum gravity with fermions using covariant gauges of harmonic type.
It is shown that these equations can be formulated consistently in a gauge of
Landau type (for negative cosmological constant). A numerical analysis of the
equations hints towards the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking, depending
on the value of the coupling constant.
