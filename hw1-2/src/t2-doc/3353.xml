Gauge Field Theory Coherent States (GCS) : I. General Properties
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we outline a rather general construction of diffeomorphism
covariant coherent states for quantum gauge theories.
  By this we mean states $\psi_{(A,E)}$, labelled by a point (A,E) in the
classical phase space, consisting of canonically conjugate pairs of connections
A and electric fields E respectively, such that (a) they are eigenstates of a
corresponding annihilation operator which is a generalization of A-iE smeared
in a suitable way, (b) normal ordered polynomials of generalized annihilation
and creation operators have the correct expectation value, (c) they saturate
the Heisenberg uncertainty bound for the fluctuations of $\hat{A},\hat{E}$ and
(d) they do not use any background structure for their definition, that is,
they are diffeomorphism covariant.
  This is the first paper in a series of articles entitled ``Gauge Field Theory
Coherent States (GCS)'' which aim at connecting non-perturbative quantum
general relativity with the low energy physics of the standard model. In
particular, coherent states enable us for the first time to take into account
quantum metrics which are excited {\it everywhere} in an asymptotically flat
spacetime manifold. The formalism introduced in this paper is immediately
applicable also to lattice gauge theory in the presence of a (Minkowski)
background structure on a possibly {\it infinite lattice}.
