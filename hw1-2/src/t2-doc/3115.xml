Comments on the Problem of a Covariant Formulation of Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A possible avenue towards the covariant formulation of the bosonic Matrix
Theory is explored. The approach is guided by the known covariant description
of the bosonic membrane. We point out various problems with this particular
covariantization scheme, stemming from the central question of how to enlarge
the original U(N) symmetry of Matrix Theory while preserving all of its
essential features in the infinite momentum frame.
