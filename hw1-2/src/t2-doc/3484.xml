On Perturbative Gravity and Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some applications of tree-level (classical) relations between
gravity and gauge theory that follow from string theory. Together with
$D$-dimensional unitarity, these relations can be used to perturbatively
quantize gravity theories, i.e. they contain the necessary information for
obtaining loop contributions. We also review recent applications of these ideas
showing that N=1 D=11 supergravity diverges, and review arguments that N=8 D=4
supergravity is less divergent than previously thought, though it does appear
to diverge at five loops. Finally, we describe field variables for the
Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian that help clarify the perturbative relationship
between gravity and gauge theory.
