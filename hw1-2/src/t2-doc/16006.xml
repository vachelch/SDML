High energy scattering of non-critical strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We summarize recent work, in which we consider scattering amplitudes of
non-critical strings in the limit where the energy of all external states is
large compared to the string tension. We show that the high energy limit is
dominated by a saddle point that can be mapped onto an electrostatic
equilibrium configuration of an assembly of charges associated with the
external states, together with a density of charges arising from the Liouville
field. The Liouville charges accumulate on line segments, which produce
quadratic branch cuts on the worldsheet. The electrostatics problem is solved
for string tree level in terms of hyperelliptic integrals and is given
explicitly for the 3- and 4-point functions. For generic values of the central
charge, the high energy limit behaves in a string-like fashion, with
exponential energy dependence.
