The holographic RG flow in a field theory on a curved background
</title>

<abstract>
  As shown by Freedman, Gubser, Pilch and Warner, the RG flow in ${\cal N}=4$
super-Yang-Mills theory broken to an ${\cal N}=1$ theory by the addition of a
mass term can be described in terms of a supersymmetric domain wall solution in
five-dimensional ${\cal N}=8$ gauged supergravity. The FGPW flow is an example
of a holographic RG flow in a field theory on a flat background. Here we put
the field theory studied by Freedman, Gubser, Pilch and Warner on a curved
$AdS_4$ background, and we construct the supersymmetric domain wall solution
which describes the RG flow in this field theory. This solution is a curved
(non Ricci flat) domain wall solution. This example demonstrates that
holographic RG flows in supersymmetric field theories on a curved $AdS_4$
background can be described in terms of curved supersymmetric domain wall
solutions.
