Four graviton scattering amplitude from $S^N\large{{\bf R}}^{8}$
  supersymmetric orbifold sigma model

<abstract>
  In the IR limit the Matrix string theory is expected to be described by the
$S^N\R^{8}$ supersymmetric orbifold sigma model. Recently Dijkgraaf, Verlinde
and Verlinde proposed a vertex that may describe the type IIA string
interaction. In this paper using this interaction vertex we derive the four
graviton scattering amplitude from the orbifold model in the large $N$ limit.
