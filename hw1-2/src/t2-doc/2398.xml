Recent Developments in Non-Perturbative Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  New results from the new variables/loop representation program of
nonperturbative quantum gravity are presented, with a focus on results of
Ashtekar, Rovelli and the author which greatly clarify the physical
interpretation of the quantum states in the loop representation. These include:
1) The construction of a class of states which approximate smooth metrics for
length measurements on scales, $L$, to order $l_{Planck}/L$. 2) The discovery
that any such state must have discrete structure at the Planck length. 3) The
construction of operators for the area of arbitrary surfaces and volumes of
arbitrary regions and the discovery that these operators are finite. 4) The
diagonalization of these operators and the demonstration that the spectra are
discrete, so that in quantum gravity areas and volumes are quantized in Planck
units. 5) The construction of finite diffeomorphism invariant operators that
measure geometrical quantities such as the volume of the universe and the areas
of minimal surfaces. These results are made possible by the use of new
techniques for the regularization of operator products that respect
diffeomorphism invariance. Several new results in the classical theory are also
reviewed including the solution of the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism
constraints in closed form of Capovilla, Dell and Jacobson and a new form of
the action that induces Chern-Simon theory on the boundaries of spacetime. A
new classical discretization of the Einstein equations is also presented.
