Kappa-Symmetry, Supersymmetry and Intersecting Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new form of kappa-symmetry transformations for D-branes in which
the dependence on the Born-Infeld field strength is expressed as a relative
rotation on the left- and right-moving fields with opposite parameters. Then,
we apply this result to investigate the supersymmetry preserved by certain
intersecting brane configurations at arbitrary angles and with non-vanishing
constant Born-Infeld fields. We also comment on the covariant quantization of
the D-brane actions.
