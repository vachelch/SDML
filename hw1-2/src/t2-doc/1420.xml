Moduli spaces of discrete gravity I: A few points
</title>

<abstract>
  Spectral triples describe and generalize Riemannian spin geometries by
converting the geometrical information into algebraic data, which consist of an
algebra $A$, a Hilbert space $H$ carrying a representation of $A$ and the Dirac
operator $D$ (a selfadjoint operator acting on $H$). The gravitational action
is described by the trace of a suitable function of $D$. In this paper we
examine the (path-integral-) quantization of such a system given by a finite
dimensional commutative algebra. It is then (in concrete examples) possible to
construct the moduli space of the theory, i.e. to divide the space of all Dirac
operators by the action of the diffeomorphism group, and to construct an
invariant measure on this space. We discuss expectation values of various
observables and demonstrate some interesting effects such as the effect of
coupling the system to Fermions (which renders finite quantities in cases,
where the Bosons alone would give infinite quantities) or the striking effect
of spontaneous breaking of spectral invariance.
