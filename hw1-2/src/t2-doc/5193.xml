Global geometric properties of AdS space and the AdS/CFT correspondence

  The Poisson kernels and relations between them for a massive scalar field in
a unit ball $B^n$ with Hua's metric and conformal flat metric are obtained by
describing the $B^n$ as a submanifold of an $(n+1)$-dimensional embedding
space. Global geometric properties of the AdS space are discussed. We show that
the $(n+1)$-dimensional AdS space AdS$_{n+1}$ is isomorphic to $RP^1\times B^n$
and boundary of the AdS is isomorphic to $RP^1\times S^{n-1}$. Bulk-boundary
propagator and the AdS/CFT like correspondence are demonstrated based on these
global geometric properties of the $RP^1\times B^n$.
