Massive Triadic Chern-Simons Spin-3 Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce the massive gauge invariant, second order pure spin-3 theory in
three dimensions. It consists of the addition of the second order gauge
invariant massless pure spin-3 action with the first order
topological(generalized) Chern-Simons spin-3 term corrected with lower spin
auxiliary actions which avoid lower spin ghosts propagation. This second order
intermediate action completes the catalogue of massive spin-3 actions having
topological structure. We also consider its spontaneous break down through the
addition of the inertial spin-3 nontopological Fierz-Pauli mass term. It is
shown that this non gauge invariant pure spin-3 system is the uniform
generalization of linearized massive vector Chern-Simons gravity and propagates
just two spin $3^{\pm}$ excitations having different masses.
