Naked singularities in dilatonic domain wall space-times
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate gravitational effects of extreme, non-extreme and ultra-
extreme domain walls in the presence of a dilaton field. The dilaton is a
scalar field without self-interaction that couples to the matter po- tential
that is responsible for the formation of the wall. Motivated by superstring and
supergravity theories, we consider both an exponential dilaton coupling
(parametrized with the coupling constant alpha and the case where the coupling
is self-dual, i.e. it has an extremum for a fi- nite value of the dilaton. For
an exponential dilaton coupling, extreme walls (which are static planar
configurations with surface energy density sigma_ext saturating the
corresponding Bogomol'nyi bound) have a naked (planar) singularity outside the
wall for alpha>1, while for alpha smaller or equal to 1 the singularity is
null. On the other hand, non-extreme walls (bubbles with two insides and
sigma_non > sigma_ext and ultra-extreme walls bubbles of false vacuum decay
with sigma_ultra < sigma_ext always have naked singularities. There are
solutions with self-dual couplings, which reduce to singularity-free vacuum
domain wall space--times. However, only non- and ultra-extreme walls of such a
type are dynamically stable.
