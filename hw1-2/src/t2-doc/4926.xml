Classification of Poisson-Lie T-dual models with two-dimensional targets
</title>

<abstract>
  Four-dimensional Manin triples and Drinfeld doubles are classified and
corresponding two-dimensional Poisson-Lie T-dual sigma models on them are
constructed. The simplest example of a Drinfeld double allowing decomposition
into two nontrivially different Manin triples is presented.
