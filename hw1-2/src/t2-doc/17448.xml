Extended supersymmetry for the Bianchi-type cosmological models
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we propose a superfield description for all Bianchi-type
cosmological models. The action is invariant under world-line local $n=4$
supersymmetry with $SU(2)_{local}XSU(2)_{global}$ internal symmetry. Due to the
invariance of the action we obtain the constraints, which form a closed
superalgebra of the $n=4$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This procedure
provides the inclusion of supermatter in a sistematic way.
