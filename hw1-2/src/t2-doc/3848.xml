Heat kernel for non-minimal operators on a Kahler manifold
</title>

<abstract>
  The heat kernel expansion for a general non--minimal operator on the spaces
$C^\infty (\Lambda^k)$ and $C^\infty (\Lambda^{p,q})$ is studied. The
coefficients of the heat kernel asymptotics for this operator are expressed in
terms of the Seeley coefficients for the Hodge--de Rham Laplacian.
