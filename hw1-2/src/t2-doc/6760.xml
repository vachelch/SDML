Supergravity S-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct supergravity solutions corresponding to space-like branes in
string theory. Our approach is to apply the usual solution generating
techniques to an appropriate time-dependent solution of the eleven dimensional
vacuum Einstein equations. In this way all SDp-brane solutions are obtained, as
well as the NS and M-theory space branes. Bound states of SDp/SD(p-2)- and
SDp/SD(p-4)-branes are also constructed. Finally, we begin an investigation of
the near-brane regions and singularity structure of these solutions.
