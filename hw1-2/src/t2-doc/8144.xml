Renormalisability of the SU(2)$\times$U(1) Electroweak Theory with
  Massive W Z Fields and Massive Matter Fields

<abstract>
  We extend the previous work and study the renormalisability of the SU$_L$(2)
$\times$ U$_Y$(1) electroweak theory with massive W Z fields and massive matter
fields. We expound that with the constraint conditions caused by the W Z mass
term and the additional condition chosen by us we can still performed the
quantization in the same way as before. We also show that when the $\delta-$
functions appearing in the path integral of the Green functions and
representing the constraint conditions are rewritten as Fourier integrals with
Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_a$ and $\lambda_y$, the total effective action
consisting of the Lagrange multipliers, ghost fields and the original fields is
BRST invariant. Furthermore, with the help of the the renormalisability of the
theory without the the mass term of matter fields, we find the general form of
the divergent part of the generating functional for the regular vertex
functions and prove the renormalisability of the theory with the mass terms of
the W Z fields and the matter fields.
