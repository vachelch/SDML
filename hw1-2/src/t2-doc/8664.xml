Effective potential for a covariantly constant gauge field in curved
  spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the influence of gravitational effects on the stabilization of the
chromomagnetic vacuum. The one-loop effective potential for a covariantly
constant SU(2) gauge field in ${\bf S}^2 \times {\bf R}^2$ and ${\bf T}^2
\times {\bf R}^2$ is calculated. A possibility of curvature-induced phase
transitions between zero and nonzero chromomagnetic vacua is found ---what is
also confirmed through the calculation of the renormalization group (RG)
improved effective potential on constant-curvature spaces with small curvature.
Numerical evaluation indicates that for some curvatures the imaginary part of
the effective potential disappears (gravitational stabilization of the
chromomagnetic vacuum occurs).
