Exact anisotropic brane cosmologies
</title>

<abstract>
  We present exact solutions of the gravitational field equations in the
generalized Randall-Sundrum model for an anisotropic brane with Bianchi type I
and V geometry, with perfect fluid and scalar fields as matter sources. Under
the assumption of a conformally flat bulk (with vanishing Weyl tensor) for a
cosmological fluid obeying a linear barotropic equation of state the general
solution of the field equations can be expressed in an exact parametric form
for both Bianchi type I and V space-times. In the limiting case of a stiff
cosmological fluid with pressure equal to the energy density, for a Bianchi
type I Universe the solution of the field equations are obtained in an exact
analytic form. Several classes of scalar field models evolution on the brane
are also considered, corresponding to different choices of the scalar field
potential. For all models the behavior of the observationally important
parameters like shear, anisotropy and deceleration parameter is considered in
detail.
