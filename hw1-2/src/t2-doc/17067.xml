Solitons in Noncommutative Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a unified treatment of classical solutions of noncommutative gauge
theories. We find all solutions of the noncommutative Yang-Mills equations in 2
dimensions; and show that they are labelled by two integers -- the rank of
gauge group and the magnetic charge. The magnetic vortex solutions are unstable
in 2+1 dimensions, but correspond to the full, stable BPS solutions of N=4 U(1)
noncommutative gauge theory in 4 dimensions, that describes N infinite D1
strings that pierce a D3 brane at various points, in the presence of a
background B field in the Seiberg-Witten limit. We discuss the behaviour of
gauge invariant observables in the background of the solitons. We use these
solutions to construct a panoply of BPS and non-BPS solutions of supersymmetric
gauge theories that describe various configurations of D-branes. We analyze the
instabilities of the non-BPS solutions. We also present an exact analytic
solution of noncommutative gauge theory that describes a U(2) monopole.
