Hopf Map and Quantization on Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantization of a system constrained to move on a sphere is considered by
taking a square root of the ``on sphere condition''. We arrive at the fibre
bundle structure of the Hopf map in the cases of $S^{2} $and $S^{4}$. This
leads to more geometrical understanding of monopole and instanton gauge
structures that emerge in the course of quantization.
