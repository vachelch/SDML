Strings, Branes and Two-Time Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the ideas and formalism of Two-Time Physics from particle
dynamics to some specific examples of string and p-brane (p >= 1) dynamics. The
two-time string or p-brane action can be gauge fixed to produce various
one-time string or p-brane actions that are dual to each other under gauge
transformations. We discuss the particular gauges that correspond to
tensionless strings and p-branes in flat (d-1)+1 spacetime, rigid strings and
p-branes in flat (d-1)+1 spacetime, and tensionless strings and p-branes
propagating in the AdS_{d-n} x S^n backgrounds.
