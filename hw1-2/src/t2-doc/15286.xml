Perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of the two-dimensional
  string/Yang-Mills correspondence
</title>

  It is known that YM_2 with gauge group SU(N) is equivalent to a string theory
with coupling g_s=1/N, order by order in the 1/N expansion. We show how this
results can be obtained from the bosonization of the fermionic formulation of
YM_2, improving on results in the literature, and we examine a number of
non-perturbative aspects of this string/YM correspondence. We find
contributions to the YM_2 partition function of order exp{-kA/(\pi\alpha' g_s)}
with k an integer and A the area of the target space, which would correspond,
in the string interpretation, to D1-branes. Effects which could be interpreted
as D0-branes are instead stricly absent, suggesting a non-perturbative
structure typical of type 0B string theories. We discuss effects from the YM
side that are interpreted in terms of the stringy exclusion principle of
Maldacena and Strominger. We also find numerically an interesting phase
structure, with a region where YM_2 is described by a perturbative string
theory separated from a region where it is described by a topological string
theory.
