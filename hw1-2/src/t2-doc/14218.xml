On the Entropy of a Quantum Field in the Rotating Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the brick wall method we calculate the free energy and the entropy
of the scalar field in the rotating black holes. As one approaches the
stationary limit surface rather than the event horizon in comoving frame, those
become divergent. Only when the field is comoving with the black hole (i.e.
$\Omega_0 = \Omega_H$) those become divergent at the event horizon. In the
Hartle-Hawking state the leading terms of the entropy are $ A \frac{1}{h} + B
\ln(h) + finite$, where $h$ is the cut-off in the radial coordnate near the
horizon. In term of the proper distance cut-off $\epsilon$ it is written as $ S
= N A_H/\epsilon^2$. The origin of the divergence is that the density of state
on the stationary surface and beyond it diverges.
