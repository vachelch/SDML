3-branes on resolved conifold
</title>

<abstract>
  The type IIB supergravity solution describing a collection of regular and
fractional D3 branes on the conifold (hep-th/0002159) was recently generalized
to the case of the deformed conifold (hep-th/0007191). Here we present another
generalization -- when the conifold is replaced by the resolved conifold. This
solution can be found in two different ways: (i) by first explicitly
constructing the Ricci-flat Kahler metric on resolved conifold and then solving
the supergravity equations for the D3-brane ansatz with constant dilaton and
(self-dual) 3-form fluxes; (ii) by generalizing the ``conifold'' ansatz of
hep-th/0002159 in a natural ``asymmetric'' way so that the 1-d action
describing radial evolution still admits a superpotential and then solving the
resulting 1-st order system. The superpotentials for the ``resolved'' and
``deformed'' conifold cases turn out to have essentially the same simple
structure. The solution in the resolved conifold case has the same asymptotic
UV behaviour as in the conifold case, but unlike the deformed conifold case is
still singular in the IR. The naked singularity is of repulson type and may
have a brane resolution.
