Type II Duality Symmetries in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the different discrete duality symmetries in six dimensions that
act within and between (i) the 10-dimensional heterotic string compactified on
$T^4$, (ii) the 10-dimensional Type IIA string compactified on $K3$ and (iii)
the 10-dimensional Type IIB string compactified on $K3$. In particular we show
that the underlying group-theoretical structure of these discrete duality
symmetries is determined by the proper cubic group ${\cal C}/\Z_2$. Our group
theoretical interpretation leads to simple rules for constructing the explicit
form of the different discrete Type II duality symmetries in an arbitrary
background. The explicit duality rules we obtain are applied to construct dual
versions of the 6-dimensional chiral null model.
