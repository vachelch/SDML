On the sqrt{2} puzzle in AdS_2/CFT_1
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we analyze the Hamiltonian formulation of the
Jackiw-Teitelboim model of 2D gravity and calculate the central charge
associated with the asymptotic symmetries, taking care of boundary terms. For
black hole solutions, we show that there is no sqrt{2} discrepancy between the
thermodynamical entropy and the statistical one obtained via Cardy's formula.
