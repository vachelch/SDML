A Diagramatic Analysis of Duality in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a diagramatic notation for supersymmetric gauge theories. The
notation is a tool for exploring duality and helps to present the field content
of more complicated models in a simple visual way. We introduce the notation
with a few examples from the literature. The power of the formalism allows us
to study new models with gauge group $(SU(N))^k$ and their duals. Amongst these
are models which, contrary to a naive analysis, possess no conformal phase.
