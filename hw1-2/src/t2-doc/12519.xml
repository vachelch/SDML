String Network from M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the three string junctions and string networks in Type IIB string
theory by explicity constructing the holomorphic embeddings of the M-theory
membrane that describe such configurations. The main feature of them such as
supersymmetry, charge conservation and balance of tensions are derived in a
more unified manner. We calculate the energy of the string junction and show
that there is no binding energy associated with the junction.
