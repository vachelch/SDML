AdS/CFT correspondence in cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  The attempt to understand if AdS/CFT correspondence may be realized as the
one between some AdS-like cosmological space and CFT living on the boundary is
made. In order to obtain such cosmology we exchange the time and radial
coordinates in d5 Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter (S-AdS) BH (with corresponding
signature change). The test on proportionality of free energies from such d5
cosmological space (after AdS/CFT identification of parameters) and from ${\cal
N}=4$ SU(N) super Yang-Mills quantum theory is successfully passed.
