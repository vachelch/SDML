The Measure from Schwinger-Dyson Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We review a new prescription for calculating the Lagrangian path integral
measure directly from the Hamiltonian Schwinger-Dyson equations. The method
agrees with the usual way of deriving the measure in which one has to perform
the path integration over momenta.
