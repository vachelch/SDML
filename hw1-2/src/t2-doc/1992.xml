The Spontaneous Compactification of the Closed Bosonic String
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the higher space-time derivative terms that occur in closed
bosonic string field theory are reminiscent of those found in the Landau theory
of liquid-crystal transitions. We examine the lowest level approximation of the
closed bosonic string and find evidence for the existence of a new vacuum that
spontaneously breaks Lorentz and translation symmetries. This effect can be
interpreted as a spontaneous compactification of the theory.
