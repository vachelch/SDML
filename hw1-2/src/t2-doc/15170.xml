QCD/String holographic mapping and high energy scattering amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  We find a one to one mapping between low energy string dilaton states in AdS
bulk and high energy glueball states on the corresponding boundary. This
holographic mapping leads to a relation between bulk and boundary scattering
amplitudes. From this relation and the dilaton action we find the appropriate
momentum scaling for high energy QCD amplitudes at fixed angles.
