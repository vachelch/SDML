The Non-perturbative Canonical Quantization of the N=1 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-perturbative canonical quantization of the N=1 supergravity with the
non-zero cosmological constant is studied using the Ashtekar formalism. A
semi-classical wave function is obtained and it has the form of the exponential
of the N=1 supersymmetric extension of the Chern-Simons functional. The N=1
supergravity in the Robertson-Walker universe is also examined and some
analytic solutions are obtained. (We omit all graphs in the following LaTex
file.)
