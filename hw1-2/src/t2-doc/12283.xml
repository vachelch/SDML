Mirror Symmetry of K3 and Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a K3 and torus from view point of "mirror symmetry". We calculate
the periods of the K3 surface and obtain the mirror map, the two-point
correlation function, and the prepotential. Then we find there is no instanton
correction on K3 (also torus), which is expected from view point of Algebraic
geometry.
