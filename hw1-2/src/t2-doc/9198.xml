Renormalization Conditions and the Sliding Scale in the Implicit
  Regularization Scheme: A Simple Connection
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe in detail how a sliding scale is introduced in the
renormalization of a QFT according to integer-dimensional implicit
regularization scheme. We show that since no regulator needs to be specified at
intermediate steps of the calculation, the introduction of a mass scale is a
direct consequence of a set of renormalization conditions. As an illustration
the one loop beta-function for QED and lambda*phi^4 theories are derived. They
are given in terms of derivatives of appropriately systematized functions
(related to definited parts of the amplitudes) with respect to a mass scale mu.
Our formal scheme can be easily generalized to higher loop calculations.
