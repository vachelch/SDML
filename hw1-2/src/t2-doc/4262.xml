A note on the analyticity of AdS scalar exchange graphs in the crossed
  channel
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the analytic properties of AdS scalar exchange graphs in the
crossed channel. We show that the possible non-analytic terms drop out by
virtue of non-trivial properties of generalized hypergeometric functions. The
absence of non-analytic terms is a necessary condition for the existence of an
operator product expansion for CFT amplitudes obtained from AdS/CFT
correspondence.
