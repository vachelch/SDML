Almost Flat Planar Diagrams

  We continue our study of matrix models of dually weighted graphs. Among the
attractive features of these models is the possibility to interpolate between
ensembles of regular and random two-dimensional lattices, relevant for the
study of the crossover from two-dimensional flat space to two-dimensional
quantum gravity. We further develop the formalism of large $N$ character
expansions. In particular, a general method for determining the large $N$ limit
of a character is derived. This method, aside from being potentially useful for
a far greater class of problems, allows us to exactly solve the matrix models
of dually weighted graphs, reducing them to a well-posed Cauchy-Riemann
problem. The power of the method is illustrated by explicitly solving a new
model in which only positive curvature defects are permitted on the surface, an
arbitrary amount of negative curvature being introduced at a single insertion.
