On the Quantization of Nambu Brackets
</title>

<abstract>
  We present several non-trivial examples of the three-dimensional quantum
Nambu bracket which involve square matrices or three-index objects. Our
examples satisfy two fundamental properties of the classical Nambu bracket:
they are skew-symmetric and they obey the Fundamental Identity. We contrast our
approach to the existing literature on the quantum deformations of Nambu
mechanics. We also discuss possible applications of our results in M-theory.
