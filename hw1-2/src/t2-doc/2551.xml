On the Seiberg-Witten Approach to electric-magnetic Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  Electric-magnetic duality allows to calculate the central charges of N=2
supersymmetric theories with massless hypermultiplets as derivatives of simple
modular forms. The procedure reproduces the Seiberg-Witten results for
N_f=0,2,3 in a uniform way, but indicates open problems for N_f=1.
