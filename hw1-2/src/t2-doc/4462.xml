A Possible Resolution of the Black Hole Information Puzzle
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of information loss is considered under the assumption that the
process of black hole evaporation terminates in the decay of the black hole
interior into a baby universe. We show that such theories can be decomposed
into superselection sectors labeled by eigenvalues of the third-quantized baby
universe field operator, and that scattering is unitary within each
superselection sector. This result relies crucially on the quantum-mechanical
variability of the decay time. It is further argued that the decay rate in the
black hole rest frame is necessarily proportional to $e^{-S_{tot}}$, where
$S_{tot}$ is the total entropy produced during the evaporation process,
entailing a very long-lived remnant.
