Towards Deriving Higgs Lagrangian from Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A new method of deriving the Higgs Lagrangian from vector-like gauge theories
is explored. After performing a supersymmetric extension of gauge theories we
identify the auxiliary field associated with the "meson" superfield, in the low
energy effective theory, as the composite Higgs field. The auxiliary field, at
tree level, has a "negative squared mass". By computing the one-loop effective
action in the low energy effective theory, we show that a kinetic term for the
auxiliary field emerges when an explicit non-perturbative mechanism for
supersymmetry breaking is introduced. We find that, due to the naive choice of
the Kaehler potential, the Higgs potential remains unbounded from the below. A
possible scenario for solving this problem is presented. It is also shown that
once chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken via a non-zero vacuum expectation
value of the Higgs field, the low energy composite fermion field acquires a
mass and decouples, while in the supersymmetric limit it was kept massless by
the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions.
