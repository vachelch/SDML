Geometric Construction of Killing Spinors and Supersymmetry Algebras in
  Homogeneous Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the Killing spinors of some maximally supersymmetric supergravity
solutions whose metrics describe symmetric spacetimes (including $AdS,AdS\times
S$ and H$pp$-waves) can be easily constructed using purely geometrical and
group-theoretical methods. The calculation of the supersymmetry algebras is
extremely simple in this formalism.
