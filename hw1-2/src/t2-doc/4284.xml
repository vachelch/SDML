General quantum antibrackets
</title>

<abstract>
  The recently introduced quantum antibracket is further generalized allowing
for the defining odd operator Q to be arbitrary. We give exact formulas for
higher quantum antibrackets of arbitrary orders and their generalized Jacobi
identities. Their applications to BV-quantization and BFV-BRST quantization are
then reviewed including some new aspects.
