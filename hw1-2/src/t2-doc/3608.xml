On The Hamiltonian Structures and The Reductions of The KP Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent work on a free field realization of the Hamiltonian structures of the
classical KP hierarchy and of its flows is reviewed. It is shown that it
corresponds to a reduction of KP to the NLS system. (Talk given by D.A.D. at
the NSERC-CAP Workshop on Quantum Groups, Integrable Models and Statistical
Systems, Kingston, Canada July 13-17 1992.)
