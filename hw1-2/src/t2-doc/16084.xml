New nonultralocal quantum integrable models through gauge transformation
</title>

<abstract>
  One of the few schemes for obtaining an integrable nonultralocal quantum
model is its possible generation from an ultralocal model by a suitable gauge
transformation. Applying this scheme we discover two new nonultralocal models,
which fit well into the braided Yang-Baxter relations ensuring their quantum
integrability. Our first model is generated from a lattice Liouville-like
system, while the second one which is an exact lattice version of the
light-cone sine-Gordon is gauge transformed from a model, which gives also the
quantum mKdV for a different gauge choice.
