Spontaneous Magnetization in the Finite XXZ Spin Chain with Boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  The finite XXZ spin chain with boundaries is studied. We derive the transfer
matrix from the q-difference equation discovered by Cherednik and construct its
eigenstates by the vertex operator approach. We point out that the eigenstates
with no magnetic fields have a symmetry called the turning symmetry. Making use
of this symmetry we calculate the spontaneous magnetization in the
thermodynamic limit, which is roughly twice as large as that in the
half-infinite XXZ spin chain.
