An operator approach to BRST invariant transition amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  The transition amplitudes for the free spinless and spinning relativistic
particles are obtained by applying an operator method developed long ago by
Dirac and Schwinger to the BFV form of the BRST theory for constrained systems.
