Dilatonic Black Holes, Naked Singularities and Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend a previous calculation which treated Schwarschild black hole
horizons as quantum mechanical objects to the case of a charged, dilaton black
hole. We show that for a unique value of the dilaton parameter `a', which is
determined by the condition of unitarity of the S matrix, black holes transform
at the extremal limit into strings.
