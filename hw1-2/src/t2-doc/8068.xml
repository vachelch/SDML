Schwinger Equation as Singularly Perturbed Equation
</title>

<abstract>
A new approximation scheme for non-perturbative calculations in a quantum field
theory is proposed. The scheme is based on investigation of solutions of the
Schwinger equation with its singular character taken into account. As a
necessary supplementary boundary condition the Green functions' connected
structures correspondence principle is used. Besides the usual perturbation
theory expansion which is always available as a particular solution of our
scheme some non-perturbative solutions of an equation for the propagator are
found in the model of a self-interacting scalar field.
