Anomaly induced effective actions and Hawking radiation
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum stress tensor in the Unruh state for a conformal scalar
propagating in a 4D Schwarzschild black hole spacetime is reconstructed in its
leading behaviour at infinity and near the horizon by means of an effective
action derived by functionally integrating the trace anomaly.
