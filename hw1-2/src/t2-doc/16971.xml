Phase Space Isometries and Equivariant Localization of Path Integrals in
  Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  By considering the most general metric which can occur on a contractable two
dimensional symplectic manifold, we find the most general Hamiltonians on a two
dimensional phase space to which equivariant localization formulas for the
associated path integrals can be applied. We show that in the case of a
maximally symmetric phase space the only applicable Hamiltonians are
essentially harmonic oscillators, while for non-homogeneous phase spaces the
possibilities are more numerous but ambiguities in the path integrals occur. In
the latter case we give general formulas for the Darboux Hamiltonians, as well
as the Hamiltonians which result naturally from a generalized coherent state
formulation of the quantum theory which shows that again the Hamiltonians so
obtained are just generalized versions of harmonic oscillators. Our analysis
and results describe the quantum geometry of some two dimensional systems.
