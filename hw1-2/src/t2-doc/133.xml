Factored coset models: A unifying approach to different bosonization
  schemes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss various bosonization schemes from a path integral perspective. Our
analysis shows that the existence of different bosonization schemes, such as
abelian bosonization of non-abelian models and non-abelian bosonization of
fermions with colour and flavour indices, can be understood as different ways
of factoring out a dynamically trivial coset which contains the fermions. From
this perspective follows the importance of the coset model in ensuring the
correct superselection rules on the bosonic level.
