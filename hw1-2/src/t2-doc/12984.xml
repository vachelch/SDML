D-branes and T-duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the $T$--duality between $D$--branes is realized (i) on
$p$--brane solutions $(p=0,\cdots ,9)$ of IIA/IIB supergravity and (ii) on the
$D$--brane actions ($p=0,\cdots ,3)$ that act as source terms for the
$p$--brane solutions. We point out that the presence of a cosmological constant
in the IIA theory leads, by the requirement of gauge invariance, to a
topological mass term for the worldvolume gauge field in the 2--brane case.
