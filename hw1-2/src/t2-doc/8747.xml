Topological gauge theories with antisymmetric tensor matter fields
</title>

<abstract>
  A new type of topological matter interactions involving second-rank
antisymmetric tensor matter fields with an underlying $N_T \geq 1$ topological
supersymmetry are proposed. The construction of the 4-dimensional, $N_T = 1$
Donaldson-Witten theory, the $N_T = 1$ super-BF model and the $N_T = 2$
topological B-model with tensor matter are explicitly worked out.
