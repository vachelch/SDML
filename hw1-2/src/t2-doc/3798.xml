Screening Length in 2+1-dimensional Abelian Chern-Simons Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we systematically study the question of screening length in
Abelian Chern-Simons theories. In the Abelian Higgs theory, where there are two
massive poles in the gauge propagator at the tree level, we show that the
coefficient of one of them becomes negligible at high temperature and that the
screening length is dominantly determined by the parity violating part of the
self-energy. In this theory, static magnetic fields are screened. In the
fermion theory, on the other hand, the parity conserving part of the
self-energy determines the screening length and static magnetic fields are not
screened. Several other interesting features are also discussed.
