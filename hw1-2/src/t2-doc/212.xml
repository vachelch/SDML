D1/D5 Moduli in SCFT and Gauge Theory, and Hawking Radiation
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct marginal operators of the orbifold SCFT corresponding to all
twenty near-horizon moduli in supergravity, including operators involving twist
fields which correspond to the blowing up modes. We identify the operators with
the supergravity moduli in a 1-1 fashion by inventing a global SO(4) algebra in
the SCFT. We analyze the gauge dynamics of the D1/D5 system relevant to the
splitting $(Q_1,Q_5)\to (Q'_1,Q'_5)+ (Q''_1,Q''_5)$ with the help of a linear
sigma model. We show in supergravity as well as in SCFT that the absorption
cross-section for minimal scalars is the same all over the near-horizon moduli
space.
