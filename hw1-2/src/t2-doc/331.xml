Quantum (2,2) supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe various aspects of two-dimensional $N=2$ supergravity in
superspace. We present the solution to the constraints in terms of
unconstrained prepotentials, and the different superspace measures (full and
chiral) used in the construction of invariant actions. We discuss aspects of
the theory in light-cone gauge, including the Ward identities for correlation
functions defined with respect to the induced supergravity action.
