Non-Abelian Monopoles on Four-Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a non-abelian generalization of Witten monopole equations and we
analyze the associated moduli problem, which can be regarded as a
generalization of Donaldson theory. The moduli space of solutions for SU(2)
monopoles on K\"ahler manifolds is discussed. We also construct, using the
Mathai-Quillen formalism, the topological quantum field theory corresponding to
the new moduli problem. This theory involves the coupling of topological
Yang-Mills theory to topological matter in four dimensions
