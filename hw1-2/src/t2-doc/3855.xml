Loop representation of charged particles interacting with Maxwell and
  Chern-Simons fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The loop representation formulation of non-relativistic particles coupled
with abelian gauge fields is studied. Both Maxwell and Chern-Simons
interactions are separately considered. It is found that the loop-space
formulations of these models share significant similarities, although in the
Chern-Simons case there exists an unitary transformation that allows to remove
the degrees of freedom associated with the paths. The existence of this
transformation, which allows to make contact with the anyonic interpretation of
the model, is subjected to the fact that the charge of the particles be
quantized. On the other hand, in the Maxwell case, we find that charge
quantization is necessary in order to the geometric representation be
consistent.
