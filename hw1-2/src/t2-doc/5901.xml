Gauge theory of a massive relativistic spinning point particle
</title>

<abstract>
  A massive relativistic spinning point particle in any number of dimensions
has in a previous article been shown to be described by first class
constraints, which define a gauge theory. In the present paper we find the
corresponding finite gauge transformations. By comparing the integrated gauge
transformations to transformation equations found by Pryce, we conclude that
the selection of gauge corresponds to selection of the relativistic center of
mass frame in the model of Pryce, where a spinning particle is considered a
composite object. The Lorentz group is identified as the gauge group, and as
gauge field we identify the relativistic angular velocity. We also show that an
analogous physical interpretation is possible for the relativistic spherical
top of Hanson and Regge.
