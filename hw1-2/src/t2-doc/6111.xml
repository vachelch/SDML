Progress in classically solving ten dimensional supersymmetric reduced
  Yang-Mills theories

  It is shown that there exists an on-shell light cone gauge where half of the
fermionic components of the super vector potential vanish, so that part of the
superspace flatness conditions becomes linear. After reduction to $(1+1)$
space-time dimensions, the general solution of this subset of equations is
derived. The remaining non-linear equations are written in a form which is
analogous to Yang equations, albeit with superderivatives involving sixteen
fermionic coordinates. It is shown that this non-linear part may, nevertheless,
be solved by methods similar to powerful technics previously developed for the
(purely bosonic) self-dual Yang Mills equations in four dimensions.
