Path Integral and Solutions of the Constraint Equations: The Case of
  Reducible Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the BRST path integral for reducible gauge theories, with
appropriate boundary conditions on the ghosts, is a solution of the constraint
equations. This is done by relating the BRST path integral to the kernel of the
evolution operator projected on the physical subspace.
