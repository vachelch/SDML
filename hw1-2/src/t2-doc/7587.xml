The Schrodinger Wave Functional and Vacuum States in Curved Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  The Schrodinger picture description of vacuum states in curved spacetime is
further developed. General solutions for the vacuum wave functional are given
for both static and dynamic (Bianchi type I) spacetimes and for conformally
static spacetimes of Robertson-Walker type. The formalism is illustrated for
simple cosmological models with time-dependent metrics and the phenomenon of
particle creation is related to a special form of the kernel in the vacuum wave
functional.
