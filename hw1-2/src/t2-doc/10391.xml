Dual Description of Brane World Cosmological Constant with $H_{MNPQ}$
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a short review of the recent 5D self-tuning solution of the
cosmological constant problem with $1/H^2$ term, and present the dual
description of the solution. In the dual description, we show that the presence
of the coupling of the dual field($\sigma$) to the brane(which is a bit
different from the original theory) maintains the self-tuning property.
