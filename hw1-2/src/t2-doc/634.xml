On Equivalence of Topological and Quantum 2d Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the equivalence of Virasoro constraints imposed on continuum
limit of partition function of Hermitean 1-matrix model and the Ward identities
of Kontsevich's model. Since the first model describes ordinary $d = 2$ quantum
gravity, while the second one is supposed to coincide with Witten's topological
gravity, the result provides a strong implication that the two models are
indeed the same.
