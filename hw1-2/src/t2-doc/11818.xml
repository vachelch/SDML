  We present the coset structure of the untwisted moduli space of heterotic
$(0,2) \; Z_N$ orbifold compactifications with continuous Wilson lines. For the
cases where the internal 6-torus $T_6$ is given by the direct sum $T_4 \oplus
T_2$, we explicitly construct the K\"{a}hler potentials associated with the
underlying 2-torus $T_2$. We then discuss the transformation properties of
these K\"{a}hler potentials under target space modular symmetries. For the case
where the $Z_N$ twist possesses eigenvalues of $-1$, we find that holomorphic
terms occur in the K\"{a}hler potential describing the mixing of complex Wilson
moduli. As a consequence, the associated $T$ and $U$ moduli are also shown to
mix under target space modular transformations.
