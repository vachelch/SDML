Poisson-Lie T-duality and Loop Groups of Drinfeld Doubles
</title>

<abstract>
  A duality invariant first order action is constructed on the loop group of a
Drinfeld double. It gives at the same time the description of both of the pair
of $\sigma$-models related by Poisson-Lie T-duality. Remarkably, the action
contains a WZW-term on the Drinfeld double not only for conformally invariant
$\si$-models. The resulting actions of the models from the dual pair differ
just by a total derivative corresponding to an ambiguity in specifying a
two-form whose exterior derivative is the WZW three-form. This total derivative
is nothing but the Semenov-Tian-Shansky symplectic form on the Drinfeld double
and it gives directly a generating function of the canonical transformation
relating the $\si$-models from the dual pair.
