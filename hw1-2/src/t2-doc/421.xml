Antisymmetrised 2p-forms generalising curvature 2-forms II: a
  p-hierarchy of Reissner-Nordstrom type metrics in dimensions d>2p+1
</title>

<abstract>
  The p-hierarchy of Schwarzschild type metrics obtained in a preceing paper is
generalised here to a corresponding Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) type hierarchy in
the presence of a point charge q in d-dimensions. Certain special features
arising, concerning the horizons and the interior region, are discussed.
