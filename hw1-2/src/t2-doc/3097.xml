Charged string solutions with dilaton and modulus fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We find charged, abelian, spherically symmetric solutions (in flat
space-time) corresponding to the effective action of $D=4$ heterotic string
theory with scale-dependent dilaton $\p$ and modulus $\vp$ fields. We take into
account perturbative (genus-one), moduli-dependent `threshold' corrections to
the coupling function $f(\p,\vp)$ in the gauge field kinetic term $f(\p,\vp)
F^2_{\m\n}$, as well as non-perturbative scalar potential $V(\p, \vp)$, e.g.
induced by gaugino condensation in the hidden gauge sector. Stable, finite
energy, electric solutions (corresponding to on abelian subgroup of a
non-abelian gauge group) have the small scale region as the weak coupling
region ($\phi\ra -\infty$) with the modulus $\vp$ slowly varying towards
smaller values. Stable, finite energy, abelian magnetic solutions exist only
for a specific range of threshold correction parameters. At small scales they
correspond to the strong coupling region ($\p\ra \infty$) and the
compactification region ($\vp\ra 0$). The non-perturbative potential $V$ plays
a crucial role at large scales, where it fixes the asymptotic values of $\phi$
and $\vp$ to be at the minimum of $V$.
