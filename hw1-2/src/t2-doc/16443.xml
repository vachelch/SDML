Fuzzy-pp Waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a noncommutative version of a plane-wave solution to the
gravitational field equations. We start with a given classical solution,
admittedly rather simple, and construct an algebra and a differential calculus
which supports the metric. In the particular solution presented as an example
the 1-forms do not anticommute, to a degree which depends on the amplitude of
the deviation of the metric from the standard Minkowski metric.
