Supertubes in reduced holonomy manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the supertube configurations exist in all supersymmetric type
IIA backgrounds which are purely geometrical and which have, at least, one flat
direction. In other words, they exist in any spacetime of the form R^{1,1} x
M_8, with M_8 any of the usual reduced holonomy manifolds. These generalised
supertubes preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetries preserved by the choice of the
manifold M_8. We also support this picture with the construction of their
corresponding family of IIA supergravity backgrounds preserving from 1/4 to
1/32 of the total supercharges.
