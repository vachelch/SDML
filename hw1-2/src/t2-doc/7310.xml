New N=1 Superconformal Field Theories in Four Dimensions from D-brane
  Probes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present several new examples of nontrivial 4d N=1 superconformal
field theories. Some of these theories exhibit exotic global symmetries,
including non-simply laced groups (such as $F_4$). They are obtained by
studying threebrane probes in F-theory compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau
threefolds. The geometry of the compactification encodes in a simple way the
behavior of the gauge coupling and the K\"ahler potential on the Coulomb branch
of these theories.
