Parity Doubling, Zitterbewegung, and Rest Mass for Spin 1
</title>

<abstract>
  A 6-component "wave function" (not field, but S-matrix interpretable) for a
massive spin-1 particle parallels the Dirac "chirality-doubled" 4-component
wave function for a spin-1/2 particle, by pairing two wave functions for same
spin but opposite "handedness". The correlated "opposite-parity" pair of
complex 3-vectors defines a fluctuating spin-correlated lightlike ``internal
velocity" as well as an independent "external rapidity". Extension from
fermions to vector bosons of the velocity-fluctuation ("zitterbewegung")
interpretation of rest mass weakens theoretical motivation for elementary
scalar bosons.
