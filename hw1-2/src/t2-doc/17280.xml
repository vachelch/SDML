Using Functional Methods to Compute Quantum Effects in the Liouville
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
We use time-independent canonical transformation methods to discuss the energy
eigenfunctions for the simple linear potential, pedagogically setting the stage
for some field theory calculations to follow. We then discuss the Schr\"odinger
wave-functional method of calculating correlation functions for Liouville field
theory. We compare this approach to earlier treatments, in particular we check
against known weak-coupling results for the Liouville field defined on a
cylinder. Finally, we further set the stage for future Liouville calculations
on curved two-manifolds and briefly discuss simple quantum mechanical systems
with time-dependent Hamiltonians.
