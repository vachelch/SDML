Closedness of star products and cohomologies
</title>

<abstract>
  We first review the introduction of star products in connection with
deformations of Poisson brackets and the various cohomologies that are related
to them. Then we concentrate on what we have called ``closed star products" and
their relations with cyclic cohomology and index theorems. Finally we shall
explain how quantum groups, especially in their recent topological form, are in
essence examples of star products.
