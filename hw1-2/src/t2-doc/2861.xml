N=1 Supersymmetric Renormalization Group Flows from IIB Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider N=1 supersymmetric renormalization group flows of N=4 Yang-Mills
theory from the perspective of ten-dimensional IIB supergravity. We explicitly
construct the complete ten-dimensional lift of the flow in which exactly one
chiral superfield becomes massive (the LS flow). We also examine the
ten-dimensional metric and dilaton configurations for the ``super-QCD'' flow
(the GPPZ flow) in which all chiral superfields become massive. We show that
the latter flow generically gives rise to a dielectric 7-brane in the
infra-red, but the solution contains a singularity that may be interpreted as a
``duality averaged'' ring distribution of 5-branes wrapped on S^2. At special
values of the parameters the singularity simplifies to a pair of S-dual branes
with (p,q) charge (1,\pm 1).
