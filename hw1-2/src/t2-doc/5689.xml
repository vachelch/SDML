Holographic Domains of Anti-de Sitter Space

<abstract>
  An AdS_4 brane embedded in AdS_5 exhibits the novel feature that a
four-dimensional graviton is localized near the brane, but the majority of the
infinite bulk away from the brane where the warp factor diverges does not see
four-dimensional gravity. A naive application of the holographic principle from
the point of view of the four-dimensional observer would lead to a paradox; a
global holographic mapping would require infinite entropy density. In this
paper, we show that this paradox is resolved by the proper covariant
formulation of the holographic principle. This is the first explicit example of
a time-independent metric for which the spacelike formulation of the
holographic principle is manifestly inadequate. Further confirmation of the
correctness of this approach is that light-rays leaving the brane intersect at
the location where we expect four-dimensional gravity to no longer dominate. We
also present a simple method of locating CFT excitations dual to a particle in
the bulk. We find that the holographic image on the brane moves off to infinity
precisely when the particle exits the brane's holographic domain. Our analysis
yields an improved understanding of the physics of the AdS_4/AdS_5 model.
