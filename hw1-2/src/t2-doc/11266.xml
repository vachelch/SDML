Structure of the Electric Flux in N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory

<abstract>
  Correlators of Wilson loop operators with O_4=Tr(F_{\mu\nu}^2+...) are
computed in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. The
results are compared with the leading order perturbative computations. As a
consequence of conformal invariance, these correlators have identical forms in
the weak and strong coupling limits for circular loops. They are essentially
different for contours not protected by conformal symmetry.
