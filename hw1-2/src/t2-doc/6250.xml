Bosonization of Three Dimensional Non-Abelian Fermion Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
We discuss bosonization in three dimensions of an $SU(N)$ massive Thirring
model in the low-energy regime. We find that the bosonized theory is related
(but not equal) to $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons gauge theory. For free
massive fermions bosonization leads, at low energies, to the pure $SU(N)$
(level $k=1$) Chern-Simons theory.
