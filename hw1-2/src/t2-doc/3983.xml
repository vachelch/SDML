Three Generations in the Fermionic Construction
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain three generation SU(3)_c X SU(2)_L X U(1)_Y string models in all of
the exactly solvable (0,2) constructions sampled by fermionization. None of
these examples, including those that are symmetric abelian orbifolds, rely on
the Z_2 X Z_2 orbifold underlying the NAHE basis. We present the first known
three generation models for which the hypercharge normalization, k_1, takes
values smaller than that obtained from an SU(5) embedding, thus lowering the
effective gauge coupling unification scale. All of the models contain
fractional electrically charged and vectorlike exotic matter that could survive
in the light spectrum.
