Supertubes and special holonomy
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain a $\frac 14$-supersymmetric 6-brane solution of IIA Supergravity by
T-dualizing the supertube recently found. The resulting $C_{\it 1}$ electric
charge is related to the original $D0$-brane charge. The uplifted solution to
eleven dimensions results to be a purely geometrical configuration, which can
be interpreted as a bound state of a Taub-NUT space and a pp-wave. Being the
non trivial part of the metric pseudo-Riemannian, the resulting reduced
holonomy group is non-compact and locally isomorphic to a semidirect product of
an Abelian four dimensional group and SU(2).
