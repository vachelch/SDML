D-Branes, Derived Categories, and Grothendieck Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we describe how Grothendieck groups of coherent sheaves and
locally free sheaves can be used to describe type II D-branes, in the case that
all D-branes are wrapped on complex varieties and all connections are
holomorphic. Our proposal is in the same spirit as recent discussions of
K-theory and D-branes; within the restricted class mentioned, Grothendieck
groups encode a choice of connection on each D-brane worldvolume, in addition
to information about the smooth bundles. We also point out that derived
categories can also be used to give insight into D-brane constructions, and
analyze how a Z_2 subset of the T-duality group acting on D-branes on tori can
be understood in terms of a Fourier-Mukai transformation.
