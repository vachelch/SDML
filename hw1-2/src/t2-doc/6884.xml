Bound States of Dimensionally Reduced {SYM}_{2+1} at Finite N
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the dimensional reduction of N=1 {SYM}_{2+1} to 1+1 dimensions.
The gauge groups we consider are U(N) and SU(N), where N is finite. We
formulate the continuum bound state problem in the light-cone formalism, and
show that any normalizable SU(N) bound state must be a superposition of an
infinite number of Fock states. We also discuss how massless states arise in
the DLCQ formulation for certain discretizations.
