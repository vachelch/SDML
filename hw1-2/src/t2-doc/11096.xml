Quantum Dynamical $\check{R}$- Matrix with Spectral Parameter from
  Fusion
</title>

<abstract>
  A quantum dynamical $\check{R}$-matrix with spectral parameter is constructed
by fusion procedure. This spin-1 $\check{R}$-matrix is connected with Lie
algebra $so(3)$ and does not satisfy the condition of translation invariance.
