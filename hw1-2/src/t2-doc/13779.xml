Advances in String Theory in Curved Backgrounds: A Synthesis Report
</title>

<abstract>
  A synthetic report of the advances in the study of classical and quantum
string dynamics in curved backgrounds is provided, namely: the new feature of
multistring solutions; the effect of a cosmological constant and of spacial
curvature on classical and quantum strings; classical splitting of fundamental
strings;the general string evolution in constant curvature spacetimes;the
conformal invariant effects;strings on plane waves, shock waves and spacetime
singularities and its spectrum. New developments in string gravity and string
cosmology are reported: string driven cosmology and its predictions;the
primordial gravitation wave background; non-singular string cosmologies from
exact conformal field theories;QFT, string temperature and the string phase of
de Sitter space; the string phase of black holes;new dual relation between QFT
regimes and string regimes and the 'QFT/String Tango'; new coherent string
states and minimal uncertainty principle in string theory
