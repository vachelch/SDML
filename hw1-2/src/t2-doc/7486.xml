Coadditive differential complexes on quantum groups and quantum spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  A regular way to define an additive coproduct (or ``coaddition'') on the
q-deformed differential complexes is proposed for quantum groups and quantum
spaces related to the Hecke-type R-matrices. Several examples of braided
coadditive differential bialgebras (Hopf algebras) are presented.
