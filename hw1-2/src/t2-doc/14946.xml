BPS Saturated and Non-Extreme States in Abelian Kaluza-Klein Theory and
  Effective $N=4$ Supersymmetric String Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  We summarize results for all four-dimensional Bogomol'nyi-Sommerfield-Prasat
(BPS) saturated and non-extreme solutions of the ($4+n$)-dimensional Abelian
Kaluza-Klein theory. Within effective $N=4$ supersymmetric string vacua,
parameterized in terms of fields of the heterotic string on a six-torus, we
then present a class of BPS saturated states and the corresponding non-extreme
solutions, specified by $O(6,22,Z)$ and $SL(2,Z)$ orbits of general dyonic
charge configurations with zero axion. The BPS saturated states with
non-negative $O(6,22,Z)$ norms for electric and magnetic charge vectors, along
with the corresponding set of non-extreme solutions, are regular with non-zero
masses. BPS saturated states with the negative charge norms are singular,
unaccompanied by non-extreme solutions and become massless at particular points
of the moduli space. The role that such massless states may play in the
enhancement of non-Abelian gauge symmetry as well as local supersymmetry is
addressed.
