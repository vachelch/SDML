A Novel Spin-Statistics Theorem in (2 + 1)d Chern-Simons Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been known for some time that topological geons in quantum gravity may
lead to a complete violation of the canonical spin-statistics relation : there
may exist no connection between spin and statistics for a pair of geons. We
present an algebraic description of quantum gravity in (2 + 1)d based on the
first order formalism of general relativity and show that, although the usual
spin-statistics theorem is not valid, statistics is completely determined by
spin. Hence, a new spin-statistics theorem can be formulated.
