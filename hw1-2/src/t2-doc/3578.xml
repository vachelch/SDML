Electron-electron Bound States in Parity-Preserving QED3
</title>

<abstract>
  By considering the Higgs mechanism in the framework of a parity-preserving
Planar Quantum Electrodynamics, one shows that an attractive electron-electron
interaction may come out. The e-e interaction potential emerges as the
non-relativistic limit of the Moller scattering amplitude and it may result
attractive with a suitable choice of parameters. Numerical values of the e-e
binding energy are obtained by solving the two-dimensional Schrodinger
equation. The existence of bound states is to be viewed as an indicative that
this model may be adopted to address the pairing mechanism in some systems
endowed with parity-preservation.
