Renormalization Group for Matrix Models with Branching Interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a method to obtain the large N renormalization group flows for
matrix models of 2 dimensional gravity plus branched polymers. This method
gives precise results for the critical points and exponents for one matrix
models. We show that it can be generalized to two matrices models and we
recover the Ising critical points.
