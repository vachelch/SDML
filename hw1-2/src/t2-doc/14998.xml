Confining solutions of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Spherically and cylindrically symmetric solutions of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory
are found, whose gauge potentials have confining properties. The spherically
symmetric solutions give field distributions which have a spherical surface on
which the gauge fields become infinite (which is similar to bag models of
confinement), and the other solution has a potential which increases at large
distances. The cylindrically symmetric solution describes a classical field
"string" (flux tube) of the kind which is expected to form between quarks in
the dual superconductor picture of confinement. These solutions with classical
confining behaviour appear to be typical solutions for the classical SU(3)
Yang-Mills equations. This implies that the confining properties of the
classical SU(3) Yang-Mills theory are general properties of this theory.
