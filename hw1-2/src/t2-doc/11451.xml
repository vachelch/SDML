Radiative Corrections to the Aharonov-Bohm Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the scattering of relativistic electrons from a thin magnetic
flux tube and perturbatively calculate the order $\alpha$, radiative
correction, to the first order Born approximation. We show also that the second
order Born amplitude vanishes, and obtain a finite inclusive cross section for
the one-body scattering which incorporates soft photon bremsstrahlung effects.
Moreover, we determine the radiatively corrected Aharonov-Bohm potential and,
in particular, verify that an induced magnetic field is generated outside of
the flux tube.
