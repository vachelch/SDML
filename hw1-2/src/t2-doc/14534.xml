Dirac Spectra and Real QCD at Nonzero Chemical Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that QCD Dirac spectra well below Lambda_{QCD}, both at zero and at
nonzero chemical potential, can be obtained from a chiral Lagrangian. At
nonzero chemical potential Goldstone bosons with nonzero baryon number condense
beyond a critical value. Such superfluid phase transition is likely to occur in
any system with a chemical potential with the quantum numbers of the Goldstone
bosons. We discuss the phase diagram for one such system, QCD with two colors,
and show the existence of a tricritical point in an effective potential
approach.
