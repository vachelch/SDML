On the Large Mass Limit of the Continuum Theories in Kaplan's
  Formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  Being inspired by Kaplan's proposal for simulating chiral fermions on a
lattice, we examine the continuum analog of his domain-wall construction for
two-dimensional chiral Schwinger models. Adopting slightly unusual dimensional
regularization, we explicitly evaluate the one-loop effective action in the
limit that the domain-wall mass goes to infinity. For anomaly-free cases, the
effective action turns out to be gauge invariant in two-dimensional sense.
