Analysis of constraints in light-cone version of SU(2) Yang-Mills

<abstract>
  We study the classical dynamics of mechanical model obtained from the
light-cone version of SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory under the supposition of
gauge potential dependence only on ``time'' along the light-cone direction. The
computer algebra system Maple was used strongly to compute and separate the
complete set of constraints. In contrast to the instant form of Yang-Mills
mechanics the constraints here represent a mixed form of first and second-class
constraints and reduce the number of the physical degrees of freedom up to four
canonical one.
