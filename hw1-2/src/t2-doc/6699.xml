WZW fusion rings in the limit of infinite level
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the WZW fusion rings at finite levels form a projective system
with respect to the partial ordering provided by divisibility of the height,
i.e. the level shifted by a constant. From this projective system we obtain WZW
fusion rings in the limit of infinite level. This projective limit constitutes
a mathematically well-defined prescription for the `classical limit' of WZW
theories which replaces the naive idea of `sending the level to infinity'. The
projective limit can be endowed with a natural topology, which plays an
important role for studying its structure. The representation theory of the
limit can be worked out by considering the associated fusion algebra; this way
we obtain in particular an analogue of the Verlinde formula.
