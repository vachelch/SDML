The Cosmological Constant and the Deconstruction of Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Witten has presented an argument for the vanishing of the cosmological
constant in 2+1 dimensions. This argument is crucially tied to the specific
properties of (2+1)-dimensional gravity. We argue that this reasoning can be
deconstructed to 3+1 dimensions under certain conditions. Our observation is
also tied to a possibility that there exists a well-defined UV completion of
(3+1)-dimensional gravity.
