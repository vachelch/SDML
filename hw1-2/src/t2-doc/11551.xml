New possibilities for the gauging of chiral bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a new mechanism for the electromagnetic gauging of chiral bosons
showing that new possibilities emerge for the interacting theory of chiral
scalars. We introduce a chirally coupled gauge field necessary to mod out the
degree of freedom that obstructs gauge invariance in a system of two opposite
chiral bosons soldering them together.
