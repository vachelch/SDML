Charged Particle System in Uniform Magnetic and Electric Fields: The
  Role of Galilean Transformation
</title>

<abstract>
  Galilean transformation relates a physical system under mutually
perpendicular uniform magnetic and electric fields to that under uniform
magnetic field only. This allows a complete specification of quantum states in
the former case in terms of those for the latter. Based on this observation, we
consider the Hall effect and the behavior of a neutral composite system in the
presence of uniform electromagnetic fields.
