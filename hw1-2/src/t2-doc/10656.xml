On Connection between Topological Landau-Ginzburg Gravity and Integrable
  Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We study flows on the space of topological Landau-Ginzburg theories coupled
to topological gravity. We argue that flows corresponding to gravitational
descendants change the target space from a complex plane to a punctured complex
plane and lead to the motion of punctures.It is shown that the evolution of the
topological theory due to these flows is given by dispersionless limit of KP
hierarchy. We argue that the generating function of correlators in such
theories are equal to the logarithm of the tau-function of Generalized
Kontsevich Model.
