Supersymmetric M5-branes with H-field
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we investigate the form of calibrated M5-branes in the presence
of a nonvanishing 3-form field H. We discuss the influence of the H-field on
the deformation of supersymmetric n-cycles (in particular SLAG submanifolds in
R^n). In addition we argue for a construction which relates calibrated
M5-branes of different curved dimensions to each other.
