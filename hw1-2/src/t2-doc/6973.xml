Families of N=2 Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  In a given 4d spacetime bakcground, one can often construct not one but a
family of distinct N=2 string theories. This is due to the multiple ways N=2
superconformal algebra can be embedded in a given worldsheet theory. We
formulate the principle of obtaining different physical theories by gauging
different embeddings of the same symmetry algebra in the same ``pre-theory.''
We then apply it to N=2 strings and formulate the recipe for finding the
associated parameter spaces of gauging. Flat and curved target spaces of both
(4,0) and (2,2) signatures are considered. We broadly divide the gauging
choices into two classes, denoted by alpha and beta, and show them to be
related by T-duality. The distinction between them is formulated topologically
and hinges on some unique properties of 4d manifolds. We determine what their
parameter spaces of gauging are under certain simplicity ansatz for generic
flat spaces (R^4 and its toroidal compactifications) as well as some curved
spaces. We briefly discuss the spectra of D-branes for both alpha and beta
families.
