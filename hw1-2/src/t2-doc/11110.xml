Non-Critical Bosonic String Corrections to the Black Hole Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the quantum corrections to the entropy of a very large black
hole, coming from the theory of a $D$-dimensional, non-critical bosonic string.
We show that, for $D >2$, as a result of modular invariance the entropy is
ultraviolet finite, although it diverges in the infrared (while for $D=2$ the
entropy contains both ultraviolet and infrared divergences). The issue of
modular invariance in field theory, in connection with black-hole entropy, is
also investigated.
