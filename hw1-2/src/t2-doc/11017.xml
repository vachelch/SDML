Critical Temperature of the Deconfining Phase Transition in (2+1)d
  Georgi-Glashow Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the temperature of the phase transition in the (2+1)d Georgi-Glashow
model. The critical temperature is shown to depend on the gauge coupling and on
the ratio of Higgs and gauge boson masses. In the BPS limit of light Higgs the
previous result by Dunne, Kogan, Kovner, and Tekin is reproduced.
