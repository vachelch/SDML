Quantum Groups on Fibre Bundles
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the principle of locality and noncommutative geometry can be
connnected by a sheaf theoretical method. In this framework quantum spaces are
introduced and examples in mathematical physics are given. With the language of
quantum spaces noncommutative principal and vector bundles are defined and
their properties are studied. Important constructions in the classical theory
of principal fibre bundles like associated bundles and differential calculi are
carried over to the quantum case. At the end $q$-deformed instanton models are
introduced for every integral index.
