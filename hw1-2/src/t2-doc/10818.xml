Notes On Higher Spin Symmetries

<abstract>
  The strong form of the AdS/CFT correspondence implies that the leading $N$
expressions for the connected correlation functions of the gauge invariant
operators in the free ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the
gauge group SU(N) correspond to the boundary S matrix of the classical
interacting theory in the Anti de Sitter space. It was conjectured recently
that the theory in the bulk should be a local theory of infinitely many higher
spin fields. In this paper we study the free higher spin fields ($N=\infty$)
corresponding to the free scalar fields on the boundary. We explicitly
construct the boundary to bulk propagator for the higher spin fields and show
that the classical solutions in the bulk are in one to one correspondence with
the deformations of the free action on the boundary by the bilinear operators.
We also discuss the constraints on the correlation functions following from the
higher spin symmetry. We show that the higher spin symmetries fix the
correlation functions up to the finite number of parameters. We formulate
sufficient conditions for the bulk theory to reproduce the free field
correlation functions on the boundary.
