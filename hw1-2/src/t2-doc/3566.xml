Confining Properties of Abelian-Projected Theories and Field Strength
  Correlators
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the string representations of Abelian-projected SU(2)- and
SU(3)-gauge theories and their application to the evaluation of bilocal field
strength correlators. The large distance asymptotic behaviours of the latter
ones are shown to be in agreement with the Stochastic Vacuum Model of QCD and
existing lattice data.
