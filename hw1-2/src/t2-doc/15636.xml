Lattice Tests of Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory?
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetric Yang Mills theory is directly accessible to lattice
simulations using current methodology, and can provide a non-trivial check of
recent exact results in SQCD. In order to tune the lattice simulation to the
supersymmetric point it is neccessary to understand the behavior of the theory
with a small supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass. We introduce a soft breaking
gaugino mass in a controlled fashion using a spurion analysis. We compute the
gluino condensate, vacuum energy and bound-state masses as a function of the
gaugino mass, providing more readily accessible predictions which still test
the supersymmetric results. Finally we discuss diagnostics for obtaining the
bare lattice parameters that correspond to the supersymmetric continuum limit.
