Spontaneous orbifold symmetry breaking and generation of mass hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  A very simple mechanism is proposed that stabilizes the orbifold geometry
within the context of the Randall-Sundrum proposal for solving the hierarchy
problem. The electroweak TeV scale is generated from the Planck scale by
spontaneous breaking of the orbifold symmetry
