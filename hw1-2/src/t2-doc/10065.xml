Reflection Factors for the Principal Chiral Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the SU(2) Principal Chiral Model (at level $k=1$) on the
half-line with scale invariant boundary conditions. By looking at the IR
limiting conformal field theory and comparing with the Kondo problem, we
propose the set of permissible boundary conditions and the corresponding
reflection factors.
