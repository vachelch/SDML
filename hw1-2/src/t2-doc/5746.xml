Duality Symmetry and Soldering in Different Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a systematic method of obtaining duality symmetric actions in
different dimensions. This technique is applied for the quantum mechanical
harmonic oscillator, the scalar field theory in two dimensions and the Maxwell
theory in four dimensions. In all cases there are two such distinct actions.
Furthermore, by soldering these distinct actions in any dimension a master
action is obtained which is duality invariant under a much bigger set of
symmetries than is usually envisaged. The concept of swapping duality is
introduced and its implications are discussed. The effects of coupling to
gravity are also elaborated. Finally, the extension of the analysis for
arbitrary dimensions is indicated.
