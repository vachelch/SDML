Support of dS/CFT correspondence from perturbations of three dimensional
  spacetime

<abstract>
  We discuss the relation between bulk de Sitter three-dimensional spacetime
and the corresponding conformal field theory at the boundary, in the framework
of the exact quasinormal mode spectrum. We show that the quasinormal mode
spectrum corresponds exactly to the spectrum of thermal excitations of
Conformal Field Theory at the past boundary I^-, together with the spectrum of
the Conformal Field Theory at the future boundary I^+.
