Supersymmetric Fluid Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  When anticommuting Grassmann variables are introduced into a fluid dynamical
model with irrotational velocity and no vorticity, the velocity acquires a
nonvanishing curl and the resultant vorticity is described by Gaussian
potentials formed from the Grassmann variables. Upon adding a further specific
interaction with the Grassmann degrees of freedom, the model becomes
supersymmetric.
