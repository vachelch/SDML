Kinks from Dynamical Systems: Domain Walls in a Deformed O(N) Linear
  Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how a integrable mechanical system provides all the localized
static solutions of a deformation of the linear O(N)-sigma model in two
space-time dimensions. The proof is based on the Hamilton-Jacobi separability
of the mechanical analogue system that follows when time-independent field
configurations are being considered. In particular, we describe the properties
of the different kinds of kinks in such a way that a hierarchical structure of
solitary wave manifolds emerges for distinct N.
