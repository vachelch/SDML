Orthogonal Decomposition of Some Affine Lie Algebras in Terms of their
  Heisenberg Subalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present note we suggest an affinization of a theorem by Kostrikin
et.al. about the decomposition of some complex simple Lie algebras ${\cal G}$
into the algebraic sum of pairwise orthogonal Cartan subalgebras. We point out
that the untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebras of types $A_{p^m-1}$ ($p$ prime,
$m\geq 1$), $B_r, \, C_{2^m}, D_r,\, G_2,\, E_7,\, E_8$ can be decomposed into
the algebraic sum of pairwise or\-tho\-go\-nal Heisenberg subalgebras. The
$A_{p^m-1}$ and $G_2$ cases are discussed in great detail. Some possible
applications of such decompositions are also discussed.
