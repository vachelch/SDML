On Stability Of The Crystal Universe Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the Goldberger-Wise mechanism and study the stability of the
Crystal Universe models. We show that the model can be stabilized, however for
configurations of Crystal Universe in the absence of fine-tuning, brane
crystals are not equidistant, i.e. a $"-+"$ pair is far away from adjacent
$"-+"$ pair, except for the fixed points of the orbifold, which differs from
the assumptions taken in the literature.
