The Fuzzy Kaehler Coset Space with the Darboux Coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  The Fedosov deformation quantization of the symplectic manifold is determined
by a 1-form differential r. We identify a class of r for which the $\star$
product becomes the Moyal product by taking appropriate Darboux coordinates,
but invariant by canonically transforming the coordinates. This respect of the
$\star$ product is explained by studying the fuzzy algebrae of the Kaehler
coset space.
