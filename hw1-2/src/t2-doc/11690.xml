Determinant Formula for the Topological N=2 Superconformal Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The Kac determinant for the Topological N=2 superconformal algebra is
presented as well as a detailed analysis of the singular vectors detected by
the roots of the determinants. In addition we identify the standard Verma
modules containing `no-label' singular vectors (which are not detected directly
by the roots of the determinants). We show that in standard Verma modules there
are (at least) four different types of submodules, regarding size and shape. We
also review the chiral determinant formula, for chiral Verma modules, adding
new insights. Finally we transfer the results obtained to the Verma modules and
singular vectors of the Ramond N=2 algebra, which have been very poorly studied
so far. This work clarifies several misconceptions and confusing claims
appeared in the literature about the singular vectors, Verma modules and
submodules of the Topological N=2 superconformal algebra.
