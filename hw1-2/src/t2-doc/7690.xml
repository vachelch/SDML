Stationary Dilatons with Arbitrary Electromagnetic Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We present two new classes of axisymmetric stationary solutions of the
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations with coupling constant $\alpha^2=3$. Both
classes are written in terms of two harmonic maps $\lambda$ and $\tau$.
$\lambda$ determines the gravitational potential and $\tau$ the electromagnetic
one in such a form that we can have an arbitrary electromagnetic field. As
examples we generate two solutions with mass ($M$), rotation ($s$) and scalar
($\delta$) parameters, one with electric charge ($q$) another one with magnetic
dipole ($Q$) parameter. The first solution contains the Kerr metric for
$q=\delta=0$.
