Supersymmetry and Strongly Coupled Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  I briefly review how supersymmetry helps in the extraction of exact
nonperturbative information from field theories, and then discuss some open
problems in strongly coupled gauge theories. (Talk given at ``30 Years of
Supersymmetry'' symposium in Minneapolis, Minnesota on October 15, 2000.)
