A variational approach to the QCD wavefunctional: Calculation of the QCD
  beta-function
</title>

<abstract>
  The beta-function is calculated for an SU(N) Yang-Mills theory from an ansatz
for the vacuum wavefunctional. Direct comparison is made with the results of
calculations of the beta-function of QCD. In both cases the theories are
asymptotically free. The only difference being in the numerical coefficient of
the beta-function, which is found to be -4 from the ansatz and -4+1/3 from
other QCD calculations. This is because, due to the constraint of Gauss' law
applied to the wavefunctional, transverse gluons (which contribute the 1/3) are
omitted. The renormalisation procedure is understood in terms of `tadpole' and
`horse-shoe' Feynman diagrams which must be interpreted with a non-local
propagator.
