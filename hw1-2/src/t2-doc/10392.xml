Supersymmetric FRW model and the ground state of supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we construct the vacuum configuration of supergravity
interacting with homogeneous complex scalar matter fields. The corresponding
configuration is of the FRW model invariant under the $n=2$ local conformal
time supersymmetry, which is a subgroup of the four dimensional space-time
supersymmetry. We show, that the potential of the scalar matter fields is a
function of the K\"ahler potential and of the arbitrary parameter $\alpha$.
This parameter enumerates the vacuum states. The scalar matter potential
induces the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry in supergravity. On the
quantum level our model is a specific supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which
admits quantum states in supergravity, and the states with zero energy are
described by the wave function of the FRW universe.
