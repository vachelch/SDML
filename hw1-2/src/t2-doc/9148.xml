Linearized supergravity from Matrix theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the linearized supergravity potential between two objects
arising from the exchange of quanta with zero longitudinal momentum is
reproduced to all orders in 1/r by terms in the one-loop Matrix theory
potential. The essential ingredient in the proof is the identification of the
Matrix theory quantities corresponding to moments of the stress tensor and
membrane current. We also point out that finite-N Matrix theory violates the
equivalence principle.
