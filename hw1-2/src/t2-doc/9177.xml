Twisting of quantum (super)algebras. Connection of Drinfeld's and
  Cartan-Weyl realizations for quantum affine algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that some factors of the universal R-matrix generate a family of
twistings for the standard Hopf structure of any quantized contragredient Lie
(super)algebra of finite growth. As an application we prove that any two
isomorphic superalgebras with different Cartan matrices have isomorphic
q-deformations (as associative superalgebras) and their standard
comultiplications are connected by such twisting. We present also an explicit
relation between the generators of the second Drinfeld's realization and
Cartan-Weyl generators of quantized affine nontwisted Kac-Moody algebras.
Further development of the theory of quantum Cartan-Weyl basis, closely related
with this isomorphism, is discussed. We show that Drinfeld's formulas of a
comultiplication for the second realization are a twisting of the standard
comultiplication by factors of the universal R-matrix. Finally, properties of
the Drinfeld's comultiplication are considered.
