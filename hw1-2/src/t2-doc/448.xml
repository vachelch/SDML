Supersymmetric E_{8(+8)} / SO(16) Sigma-Model Coupled to N=1
  Supergravity in Three-Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A three-dimensional simple N=1 supergravity theory with a supersymmetric
sigma-model on the coset E_{8(+8)} / SO(16) is constructed. Both bosons and
fermions in the matter multiplets are in the spinorial 128-representation of
SO(16) with the same chirality. Due to their common chirality, this model can
not be obtained from the maximal N=16 supergravity. By introducing an
independent vector multiplet, we can also gauge an arbitrary subgroup of SO(16)
together with a Chern-Simons term. Similar N=1 supersymmetric sigma-models
coupled to supergravity are also constructed for the cosets F_{4(-20)} / SO(9)
and SO(8,n) / SO(8) X SO(n).
