Relating the Cosmological Constant and Supersymmetry Breaking in Warped
  Compactifications of IIB String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been suggested that the observed value of the cosmological constant is
related to the supersymmetry breaking scale M_{susy} through the formula Lambda
\sim M_p^4 (M_{susy}/M_p)^8. We point out that a similar relation naturally
arises in the codimension two solutions of warped space-time varying
compactifications of string theory in which non-isotropic stringy moduli induce
a small but positive cosmological constant.
