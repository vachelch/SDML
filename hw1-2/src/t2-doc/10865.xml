Supersymmetric action of multiple D0-branes from Matrix theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study one-loop effective action of Berkooz-Douglas Matrix theory and
obtain non-abelian action of D0-branes in the longitudinal 5-brane background.
In this paper, we extend the analysis of hep-th/0201248 and calculate the part
of the effective action containing fermions. We show that the effective action
is manifestly invariant under the loop-corrected SUSY transformation, and give
the explicit transformation laws. The effective action consists of blocks which
are closed under the SUSY, and includes the supersymmetric completion of the
couplings to the longitudinal 5-branes proposed by Taylor and Van Raamsdonk as
a subset.
