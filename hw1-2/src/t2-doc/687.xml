Type IIA String and Matrix String on PP-wave
</title>

<abstract>
  We study type IIA string theories on the pp-waves with 24 supercharges. The
type IIA pp-wave backgrounds are derived from the maximally supersymmetric
pp-wave solution in eleven dimensions through the toroidal compactification on
the spatial isometry directions. The associated actions of type IIA strings are
obtained by using these metrics and other background fields of the type IIA
supergravities on the one hand. On the other hand, we derive these theories
from D=11 supermembrane on the pp-wave via double dimensional reduction for the
spatial isometry directions. The resulting actions agree with those of type IIA
strings obtained in the study of the supergravities. Also, the action of the
matrix string is written down. Moreover, the quantization of closed and open
strings is discussed. In particular, we study Dp-branes allowed in one of the
type IIA theories.
