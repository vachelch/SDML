Low-scale supergravity inflation with R-symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a supergravity model of inflation with R-symmetry and a single
scalar field, the inflaton, slowly rolling away from the origin. The scales of
inflation can be as low as the supersymmetry breaking scale of 10^10 GeV or
even the electroweak scale of 10^3 GeV which could be relevant in the context
of theories with submillimiter dimensions. Exact analytical solutions are
presented and a comparison with related models is given.
