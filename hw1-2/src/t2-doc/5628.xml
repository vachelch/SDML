String Field Theory from IIB Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive Schwinger-Dyson equations for the Wilson loops of a type IIB matrix
model. Superstring coordinates are introduced through the construction of the
loop space. We show that the continuum limit of the loop equation reproduces
the light-cone superstring field theory of type IIB superstring in the large-N
limit. We find that the interacting string theory can be obtained in the double
scaling limit as it is expected.
