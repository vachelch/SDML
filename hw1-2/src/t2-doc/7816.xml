Mirror Symmetry for Hypersurfaces in Weighted Projective Space and
  Topological Couplings
</title>

<abstract>
  By means of toric geometry we study hypersurfaces in weighted projective
space of dimension four. In particular we compute for a given manifold its
intrinsic topological coupling. We find that the result agrees with the
calculation of the corresponding coupling on the mirror model in the large
complex structure limit.
