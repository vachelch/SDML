Physical States in Topological Coset Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent results about topological coset models are summarized. The action of a
topological ${G\over H}$ coset model ($rank\ H = rank\ G$) is written down as a
sum of ``decoupled" matter, gauge and ghost sectors.
  The physical states are in the cohomology of a BRST-like operator that
relates these secotrs. The cohomology on a free field Fock space as well as on
an irreducible representation of the ``matter" Kac-Moody algebra are extracted.
We compare the results with those of $(p,q)$ minimal models coupled to gravity
and with $(p,q)$ $W_N$ strings for the case of $A_1^{(1)}$ at level $k={p\over
q}-2$ and $A_1^{(N-1)}$ at level $k={p\over q}-N$ respectively.
