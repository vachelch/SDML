Noncommutative effective theory of vortices in a complex scalar field
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a noncommutative theory description for vortex configurations in a
complex field in 2+1 dimensions. We interpret the Magnus force in terms of the
noncommutativity, and obtain some results for the quantum dynamics of the
system of vortices in that context.
