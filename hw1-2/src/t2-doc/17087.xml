Abelian Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that on three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds without boundaries and
with trivial first real de Rham cohomology group (and in no other dimensions)
scalar field theory and Maxwell theory are equivalent: the ratio of the
partition functions is given by the Ray-Singer torsion of the manifold. On the
level of interaction with external currents, the equivalence persists provided
there is a fixed relation between the charges and the currents.
