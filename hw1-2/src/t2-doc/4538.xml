An effective quantum mechanism for mass generation in
  diffeomorphism-invariant theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a scenario for particle-mass generation, assuming the existence of
a physical regime where, firstly, physical particles can be considered as
point-like objects moving in a background space-time and, secondly, their mere
presence spoils the invariance under the local diffeomorphism group, resulting
in an anomalous realization of the latter. Under these hypotheses, we describe
mass generation starting from the massless free theory. The mechanism is not
sensitive to the detailed description of the underlying theory at higher
energies, leaning only on general structural features of it, specifically
diffeomorphism invariance.
