Scalar-QED \beta-functions near Planck's Scale
</title>

<abstract>
  The Renormalization Group Flow Equations of the Scalar-QED model near
Planck's scale are computed within the framework of the average effective
action. Exact Flow Equations, corrected by Einstein Gravity, for the running
self-interacting scalar coupling parameter and for the running v.e.v. of
$\phi^* \phi$, are computed taking into account threshold effects. Analytic
solutions are given in the infrared and ultraviolet limits.
