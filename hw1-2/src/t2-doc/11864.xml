Anomalous Transformation in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  An ``anomalous'' supersymmetry transformation of the gaugino axial current is
given in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The contact term is computed to
one-loop order by a gauge-invariant point-splitting procedure. We reexamine the
supercurrent anomaly in this method.
