Black Holes as Elementary Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that the qualitative features of black holes, regarded as
quantum mechanical objects, depend both on the parameters of the hole and on
the microscopic theory in which it is embedded. A thermal description is
inadequate for extremal holes. In particular, extreme holes of the charged
dilaton family can have zero entropy but non-zero, and even (for $a>1$)
formally infinite, temperature. The existence of a tendency to radiate at the
extreme, which threatens to overthrow any attempt to identify the entropy as
available internal states and also to expose a naked singularity, is at first
sight quite disturbing. However by analyzing the perturbations around the
extreme holes we show that these holes are protected by mass gaps, or
alternatively potential barriers, which remove them from thermal contact with
the external world. We suggest that the behavior of these extreme dilaton black
holes, which from the point of view of traditional black hole theory seems
quite bizarre, can reasonably be interpreted as the holes doing their best to
behave like normal elementary particles. The $a<1$ holes behave qualitatively
as extended objects.
