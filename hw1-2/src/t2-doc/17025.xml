Gravitational Couplings, Orientifolds and M-Planes
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine string-theory orientifold planes of various types including the Sp
and SO-odd planes, and deduce the gravitational Chern-Simons couplings on their
world-volumes. Consistency checks are carried out in different spacetime
dimensions using various dualities, including those relating string theory with
F-theory and M-theory. It is shown that when an orientifold 3-plane crosses a
5-brane, the jump in the charge is accompanied by a corresponding change in the
gravitational couplings.
