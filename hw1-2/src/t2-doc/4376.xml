String propagation near Kaluza-Klein black holes: an analytical and
  numerical study
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper presents a detailed investigation of the motion of a string near a
Kaluza-Klein black hole, using the null string expansion. The zeroth-order
string equations of motion are set up separately for electrically and
magnetically charged black hole backgrounds. The case of a string falling
head-on into the black hole is considered in detail. The equations reduce to
quadratures for a magnetically charged hole, while they are amenable to
numerical solution for an electrically charged black hole. The Kaluza-Klein
radius seen by the string as it approaches the black hole decreases in the
magnetic case and increases in the electric case. For magnetic backgrounds,
analytical solutions can be obtained in terms of elliptical integrals. These
reduce to elementary functions in special cases, including that of the
well-known Pollard-Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole. Here the string exhibits
decelerated descent into the black hole. The results in the authors' earlier
papers are substantiated here by presenting a detailed analysis. A preliminary
analysis of first-order perturbations is also presented, and it is shown that
the invariant string length receives a nonzero contribution in the first order.
