AdS/SCFT in Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  A discussion of the AdS/CFT correspondence in IIB is given in a superspace
context. The main emphasis is on the properties of SCFT correlators on the
boundary which are studied using harmonic superspace techniques. These
techniques provide the easiest way of implementing the superconformal Ward
identities. The Ward identities, together with analyticity, can be used to give
a compelling argument in support of the non-renormalisation theorems for two-
and three-point functions, and to establish the triviality of extremal and
next-to-extremal correlation functions. The OPE in is also briefly discussed.
