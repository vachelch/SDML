Complex sine-Gordon Theory for Coherent Optical Pulse Propagation
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the McCall-Hahn theory of self-induced transparency in
coherent optical pulse propagation can be identified with the complex
sine-Gordon theory in the sharp line limit. We reformulate the theory in terms
of the deformed gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten sigma model and address various new
aspects of self-induced transparency.
