Warped AdS near-horizon geometry of completely localized intersections
  of M5-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a Hanany-Witten set-up relevant to N = 2 superconformal field
theories. We find the exact near-horizon solution for this 11-dimensional
system which involves intersecting M5-branes. The metric describes a warped
product of AdS_5 with a manifold with SU(2) x U(1) isometry.
