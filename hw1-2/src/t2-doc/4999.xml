Variational calculations in gauge theories with approximate projection
  on gauge invariant states

<abstract>
  Variational calculations using Gaussian wave functionals combined with an
approximate projection on gauge invariant states are presented. We find that
the energy exhibits a minimum for a wave functional centered around a non
vanishing background magnetic field. We show that divergences can be removed by
a renormalization of the coupling constant. The resulting expectation value of
the gluon condensate is found to be in qualitative agreement with
phenomenological estimates.
