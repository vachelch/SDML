BT Worldsheet for Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the Bardakci-Thorn (BT) worldsheet formalism to supersymmetric
non-abelian gauge theory. Our method covers the cases of N =1,2,4 extended
supersymmetry. This task requires the introduction of spinor valued Grassmann
variables on the worldsheet analogous to those of the supersymmetric
formulation of superstring theory. As in the pure Yang-Mills case, the
worldsheet formalism automatically generates the correct quartic vertices from
the cubic vertices. We also discuss coupling renormalization to one loop order.
