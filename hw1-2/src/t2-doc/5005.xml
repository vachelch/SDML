Principles of Discrete Time Mechanics: II. Classical field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the principles discussed in an earlier paper to the construction of
discrete time field theories. We derive the discrete time field equations of
motion and Noether's theorem and apply them to the Schrodinger equation to
illustrate the methodology. Stationary solutions to the discrete time
Schrodinger wave equation are found to be identical to standard energy
eigenvalue solutions except for a fundamental limit on the energy. Then we
apply the formalism to the free neutral Klein Gordon system, deriving the
equations of motion and conserved quantities such as the linear momentum and
angular momentum. We show that there is an upper bound on the magnitude of
linear momentum for physical particle-like solutions. We extend the formalism
to the charged scalar field coupled to Maxwell's electrodynamics in a gauge
invariant way. We apply the formalism to include the Maxwell and Dirac fields,
setting the scene for second quantisation of discrete time mechanics and
discrete time Quantum Electrodynamics.
