Deformed oscillator algebras for two dimensional quantum superintegrable
  systems
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum superintegrable systems in two dimensions are obtained from their
classical counterparts, the quantum integrals of motion being obtained from the
corresponding classical integrals by a symmetrization procedure. For each
quantum superintegrable systema deformed oscillator algebra, characterized by a
structure function specific for each system, is constructed, the generators of
the algebra being functions of the quantum integrals of motion. The energy
eigenvalues corresponding to a state with finite dimensional degeneracy can
then be obtained in an economical way from solving a system of two equations
satisfied by the structure function, the results being in agreement to the ones
obtained from the solution of the relevant Schrodinger equation. The method
shows how quantum algebraic techniques can simplify the study of quantum
superintegrable systems, especially in two dimensions.
