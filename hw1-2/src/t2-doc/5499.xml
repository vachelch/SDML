How to go with an RG Flow
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the formalism of holographic renormalization to domain wall
solutions of 5-dimensional supergravity which are dual to deformed conformal
field theories in 4 dimensions. We carefully compute one- and two-point
functions of the energy-momentum tensor and the scalar operator mixing with it
in two specific holographic flows, resolving previous difficulties with these
correlation functions. As expected, two-point functions have a 0-mass dilaton
pole for the Coulomb branch flow in which conformal symmetry is broken
spontaneously but not for the flow dual to a mass deformation in which it is
broken explicitly. A previous puzzle of the energy scale in the Coulomb branch
flow is explained.
