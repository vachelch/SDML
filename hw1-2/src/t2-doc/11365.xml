Modified Tetrahedron Equations and Related 3D Integrable Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a modified version of the tetrahedron equations we construct a new
family of $N$-state three-dimensional integrable models with commuting
two-layer transfer-matrices. We investigate a particular class of solutions to
these equations and parameterize them in terms of elliptic functions. The
corresponding models contain one free parameter $k$ -- an elliptic modulus.
