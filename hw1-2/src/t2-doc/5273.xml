Dual String Pairs With N=1 And N=2 Supersymmetry In Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on a simple adiabatic argument and by considering the heterotic string
counterpart of certain symmetries of Type II superstrings such as $(-1)^{F_L}$
and orientation reversal, we construct orbifold candidates for dual pairs of
heterotic and Type II string theories with $N=2$ and $N=1$ supersymmetry. We
also analyze from a similar point of view the ${\rm K3}$ fibrations that enter
in recently proposed $N=2$ candidates and use this structure together with
certain orientation-reversing symmetries to construct $N=1$ dual pairs. These
pairs involve generalizations of Type I vacua which can be equivalent to
$E_8\times E_8$ heterotic strings, while standard Type I vacua are related to
$SO(32)$.
