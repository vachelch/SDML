  Weinberg-Salam theory and $SU(5)$ grand unified theory are reconstructed
using the generalized differential calculus extended on the discrete space
$M_4\times Z_{\mathop{}_{N}}$. Our starting point is the generalized gauge
field expressed by $A(x,n)=\!\sum_{i}a^\dagger_{i}(x,n){\bf d}a_i(x,n),
(n=1,2,\cdots N)$, where $a_i(x,n)$ is the square matrix valued function
defined on $M_4\times Z_{\mathop{}_{N}}$ and ${\bf
d}=d+\sum_{m=1}^{\mathop{}_{N}}d_{\chi_m}$ is generalized exterior derivative.
We can construct the consistent algebra of $d_{\chi_m}$ which is exterior
derivative with respect to $Z_{\mathop{}_{N}}$ and the spontaneous breakdown of
gauge symmetry is coded in ${d_{\chi_m}}$. The unified picture of the gauge
field and Higgs field as the generalized connection in non-commutative geometry
is realized. Not only Yang-Mills-Higgs lagrangian but also Dirac lagrangian,
invariant against the gauge transformation, are reproduced through the inner
product between the differential forms. Three sheets ($Z_3)$ are necessary for
Weinberg-Salam theory including strong interaction and $SU(5)$ Gut. Our
formalism is applicable to more realistic model like $SO(10)$ unification
model.
