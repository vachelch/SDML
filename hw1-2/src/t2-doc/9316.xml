D-Branes And Mirror Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study (2,2) supersymmetric field theories on two-dimensional worldsheet
with boundaries. We determine D-branes (boundary conditions and boundary
interactions) that preserve half of the bulk supercharges in non-linear sigma
models, gauged linear sigma models, and Landau-Ginzburg models. We identify a
mechanism for brane creation in LG theories and provide a new derivation of a
link between soliton numbers of the massive theories and R-charges of vacua at
the UV fixed point. Moreover we identify Lagrangian submanifolds that arise as
the mirror of certain D-branes wrapped around holomorphic cycles of K\"ahler
manifolds. In the case of Fano varieties this leads to the explanation of Helix
structure of the collection of exceptional bundles and soliton numbers, through
Picard-Lefshetz theory applied to the mirror LG theory. Furthermore using the
LG realization of minimal models we find a purely geometric realization of
Verlinde Algebra for SU(2) level k as intersection numbers of D-branes. This
also leads to a direct computation of modular transformation matrix and
provides a geometric interpretation for its role in diagonalizing the Fusion
algebra.
