Super Liouville action for Regge surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the super Liouville action for a two dimensional Regge surface by
exploiting the invariance of the theory under the superconformal group for
sphere topology and under the supermodular group for torus topology. For sphere
topology and torus topology with even spin structures, the action is completely
fixed up to a term which in the continuum limit goes over to a topological
invariant, while the overall normalization of the action can be taken from
perturbation theory. For the odd spin structure on the torus, due to the
presence of the fermionic supermodulus, the action is fixed up to a modular
invariant quadratic polynomial in the fermionic zero modes.
