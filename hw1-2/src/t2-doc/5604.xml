Gravity In A Model Of Multi Branes Alternated Between Minkowski And AdS
  Spacetime In The Fifth Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct in this paper a multi-brne model with Minkowski and AdS
spacetime alternated in the fifth dimension and study the gravity on the brane
of our universe. We will show that in this model there are both the
graviton-like resonant states which generates the "quasi-localized gravity" and
the resonant states of the massive KK mode. This model gives rise to gravity
which deviates from the Newton gravitational potential at small and large scale
which, however can be shown to be consistent with the observations in the
absence of fine-tuning of the model parameters.
