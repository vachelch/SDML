Dissipative Time Evolution of Observables in Non-equilibrium Statistical
  Quantum Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss differential-- versus integral--equation based methods describing
out--of thermal equilibrium systems and emphasize the importance of a well
defined reduction to statistical observables. Applying the projection operator
approach, we investigate on the time evolution of expectation values of linear
and quadratic polynomials in position and momentum for a statistical anharmonic
oscillator with quartic potential. Based on the exact integro-differential
equations of motion, we study the first and naive second order approximation
which breaks down at secular time-scales. A method is proposed to improve the
expansion by a non--perturbative resummation of all quadratic operator
correlators consistent with energy conservation for all times. Motion cannot be
described by an effective Hamiltonian local in time reflecting non-unitarity of
the dissipative entropy generating evolution. We numerically integrate the
consistently improved equations of motion for large times. We relate entropy to
the uncertainty product, both being expressible in terms of the observables
under consideration.
