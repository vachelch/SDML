Large-Volume String Compactifications, Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the issue of large-volume compactifications of the heterotic
string in light of the recent discoveries about strongly-coupled string
theories. Our conclusion remains firmly negative with respect to classical
compactifications of the ten-dimensional field theory, albeit for a new reason:
When the internal sixfold becomes large in heterotic units, the theory acquires
an additional threshold at energies much less then the naive Kaluza-Klein
scale. It is this additional threshold that imposes the ultimate limit on the
compactification scale: Any compactification must have M_{Kaluza Klein} >
4*10^7 Gev; for most compactifications, the actual limit is much higher.
(Generically, M_{Kaluza Klein} > alpha_{GUT} M_{Planck} in either SO(32) or
E_8*E_8 heterotic string.)
