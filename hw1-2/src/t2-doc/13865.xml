Induced $B\wedge F$ term and photon mass generation in 3+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Analysing a 3+1 dimensional model with four-Fermi interactions, we show that
topological $\BF$ terms (both abelian and non-abelian) can be induced
radiatively by massive fermions at the one-loop level. It is further pointed
out that a mechanism of photon (or non-abelian gauge field) mass generation
distinct from the usual Higgs mechanism, through the $\BF$ term, is also
implemented in the long-distance effective action of this model, provided a gap
equation is satisfied.
