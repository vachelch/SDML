The String Measure and Spectral Flow of Critical N=2 Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The general structure of N=2 moduli space at arbitrary genus and instanton
number is investigated. The N=2 NSR string measure is calculated, yielding
picture- and U(1) ghost number-changing operator insertions. An explicit
formula for the spectral flow operator acting on vertex operators is given, and
its effect on N=2 string amplitudes is discussed.
