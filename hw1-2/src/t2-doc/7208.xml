On the string interpretation of M(atrix) theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been proposed recently that, in the framework of M(atrix) theory,
N=8 supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions gives rise to
type IIA long string configurations. We point out that the quantum moduli space
of $SYM_{1+1}$ gives rise to two quantum numbers, which fit very well into
the M(atrix) theory. The two quantum numbers become familiar if one switches to
a IIB picture, where they represent configurations of D-strings and
fundamental strings. We argue that, due to the SL(2,Z) symmetry, of the IIB
theory, such quantum numbers must represent configurations that are present
also in the IIA framework.
