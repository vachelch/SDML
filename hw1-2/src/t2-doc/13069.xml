Quantum Mechanics from an Equivalence Principle
</title>

<abstract>
  We postulate that physical states are equivalent under coordinate
transformations. We then implement this equivalence principle first in the case
of one-dimensional stationary systems showing that it leads to the quantum
analogue of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation which in turn implies the Schroedinger
equation. In this context the Planck constant plays the role of covariantizing
parameter. The construction is deeply related to the GL(2,C)-symmetry of the
second-order differential equation associated to the Legendre transformation
which selects, in the case of the quantum analogue of the Hamiltonian
characteristic function, self-dual states which guarantee its existence for any
physical system. The universal nature of the self-dual states implies the
Schroedinger equation in any dimension.
