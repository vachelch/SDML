Exact solutions in two-dimensional string cosmology with back reaction
</title>

<abstract>
  We present analytic cosmological solutions in a model of two-dimensional
dilaton gravity with back reaction. One of these solutions exhibits a graceful
exit from the inflationary to the FRW phase and is nonsingular everywhere. A
duality related second solution is found to exist only in the ``pre-big-bang''
epoch and is singular at $\tau = 0$. In either case back reaction is shown to
play a crucial role in determining the specific nature of these geometries.
