The Quaternionic Dirac Lagrangian
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the use of the variational principle within quaternionic quantum
mechanics. This is non-trivial because of the non commutative nature of
quaternions. We derive the Dirac Lagrangian density corresponding to the
two-component Dirac equation. This Lagrangian is complex projected as
anticipated in previous articles and this feature is necessary even for a
classical real Lagrangian.
