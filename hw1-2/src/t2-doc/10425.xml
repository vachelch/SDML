Holography and String Dynamics in Time-dependent Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the dynamics of D-branes in a smooth time-dependent background. The
theory on the branes is a time-dependent non-commutative field theory. We find
the metric and fluxes that determine the dual holographic closed string theory.
This provides a concrete example of holography in a cosmological setting.
