Casimir Surface Force on a Dilute Dielectric Ball
</title>

<abstract>
  The Casimir surface force density F on a dielectric dilute spherical ball of
radius a, surrounded by a vacuum, is calculated at zero temperature. We treat
(n-1) (n being the refractive index) as a small parameter. The dispersive
properties of the material are taken into account by adopting a simple
dispersion relation, involving a sharp high frequency cutoff at omega =
omega_0. For a nondispersive medium there appears (after regularization) a
finite, physical, force F^{nondisp} which is repulsive. By means of a uniform
asymptotic expansion of the Riccati-Bessel functions we calculate F^{nondisp}
up to the fourth order in 1/nu. For a dispersive medium the main part of the
force F^{disp} is also repulsive. The dominant term in F^{disp} is proportional
to (n-1)^2{omega_0}^3/a, and will under usual physical conditions outweigh
F^{nondisp} by several orders of magnitude.
