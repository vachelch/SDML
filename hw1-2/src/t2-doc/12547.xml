What If Dirac Pionini Existed in a Purely Chiral Superfield Formulation?
</title>

<abstract>
  By an explicit construction, it is shown that the geometry of the SU(3) pion
multiplet with respect to the group manifold SU_L(3) x SU_R(3) maybe deformed
to admit a second pseudoscalar multiplet that is analogous to the Z_0 in
unified theories of the electroweak interactions. This observation is found to
play a key role in the construction of the N = 1 supersymmetric models with
pions and Dirac-like spin-1/2 superpartners ("pionini").
