A New Description of the E_6 Singularity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a new type of Landau-Ginzburg potential for the E_6 singularity of
the form $W=const+(Q_1(x)+P_1(x)\sqrt{P_2(x)})/x^3$ which featured in a recent
study of heterotic/typeII string duality. Here $Q_1,P_1$ and $P_2$ are
polynomials of degree 15,10 and 10, respectively. We study the properties of
the potential in detail and show that it gives a new and consistent description
of the E_6 singularity.
