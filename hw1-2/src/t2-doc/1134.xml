On the ground state of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field in two
  dimensions

  We investigate the ground state of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field in
1+1-dimensional space-time. We argue that in the quantum field theory of a free
massless (pseudo)scalar field without infrared divergences (Eur. Phys. J. C24,
653 (2002)) the ground state can be represented by a tensor product of wave
functions of the fiducial vacuum and of the collective zero-mode, describing
the motion of the ``center of mass'' of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field.
We show that the bosonized version of the BCS wave function of the ground state
of the massless Thirring model obtained in (hep-th/0210104) describes the
ground state of the free massless (pseudo)scalar field.
