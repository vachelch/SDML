Manifest Supersymmetry for BPS Walls in N=2 Nonlinear Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  BPS equations and wall solutions are studied keeping (part of) supersymmetry
(SUSY) manifest. Using N=1 superfields, massive hyper-Kahler quotient is
introduced to obtain massive N=2 (8 SUSY) nonlinear sigma models in four
dimensions with T*CP(n) target manifold, which yield BPS wall solutions for the
n=1 case. We also describe massive hyper-Kahler quotient of T*CP(n) by using
the harmonic superspace formalism which preserves all SUSY manifestly, and BPS
equations and wall solutions are obtained in the n=1 case.
