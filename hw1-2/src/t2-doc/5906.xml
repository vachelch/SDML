(Dis)continuities of Massless Limits in Spin 3/2-mediated Interactions
  and Cosmological Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend to its spin~3/2 supersymmetric partner the very recent
demonstration that the massless limit of massive spin~2 exchange amplitudes can
be made continuous in background AdS spaces, in contrast to the known flat
space discontinuities for both systems. In an AdS background, unlike spin~2
where the limit m\to0 is the massless one, spin~3/2 ``masslessness'' requires
m\to\sqrt{-\Lambda/3}, the supergravity value tuning the mass and cosmological
constant that uniquely provides gauge invariance and two helicities. We find
that continuity of the spin~3/2--mediated exchange amplitude can be regained in
two ``massless'' limits m\to0 and m\to\sqrt{-\Lambda/3}; only the latter
corresponds to cosmological supergravity.
