Mapping Class Group Representations and Generalized Verlinde Formula
</title>

<abstract>
  Unitary representations of centrally extended mapping class groups $\tilde
M_{g,1}, g\geq 1$ are given in terms of a rational Hopf algebra $H$, and a
related generalization of the Verlinde formula is presented. Formulae
expressing the traces of mapping class group elements in terms of the fusion
rules, quantum dimensions and statistics phases are proposed.
