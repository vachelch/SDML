One-Loop Divergences in Simple Supergravity: Boundary Effects
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper studies the semiclassical approximation of simple supergravity in
Riemannian four-manifolds with boundary, within the framework of
$\zeta$-function regularization. The massless nature of gravitinos, jointly
with the presence of a boundary and a local description in terms of potentials
for spin ${3\over 2}$, force the background to be totally flat. First, nonlocal
boundary conditions of the spectral type are imposed on spin-${3\over 2}$
potentials, jointly with boundary conditions on metric perturbations which are
completely invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms. The axial
gauge-averaging functional is used, which is then sufficient to ensure
self-adjointness. One thus finds that the contributions of ghost and gauge
modes vanish separately. Hence the contributions to the one-loop wave function
of the universe reduce to those $\zeta(0)$ values resulting from physical modes
only. Another set of mixed boundary conditions, motivated instead by local
supersymmetry and first proposed by Luckock, Moss and Poletti, is also
analyzed. In this case the contributions of gauge and ghost modes do not cancel
each other. Both sets of boundary conditions lead to a nonvanishing $\zeta(0)$
value, and spectral boundary conditions are also studied when two concentric
three-sphere boundaries occur. These results seem to point out that simple
supergravity is not even one-loop finite in the presence of boundaries.
