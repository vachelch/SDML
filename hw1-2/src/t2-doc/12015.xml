String Scale in Noncommutative Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  We identify the effective string scale of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory
(NCYM) with the noncommutativity scale through its dual supergravity
description. We argue that Newton's force law may be obtained with 4
dimensional NCYM with maximal SUSY. It provides a nonperturbative
compactification mechanism of IIB matrix model. We can associate NCYM with the
von Neumann lattice by the bi-local representation. We argue that it is
superstring theory on the von Neumann lattice. We show that our identification
of its effective string scale is consistent with exact T-duality (Morita
equivalence) of NCYM.
