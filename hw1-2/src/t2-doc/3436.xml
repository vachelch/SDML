On the Geometry of the Batalin-Vilkovisky Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  An invariant definition of the operator $\Delta $ of the Batalin-Vilkovisky
formalism is proposed. It is defined as the divergence of a Hamiltonian vector
field with an odd Poisson bracket (antibracket). Its main properties, which
follow from this definition, as well as an example of realization on
K\"ahlerian supermanifolds, are considered. The geometrical meaning of the
Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism is discussed.
