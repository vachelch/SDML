BRST Quantization of Gauge Theory in Noncommutative Geometry: Matrix
  Derivative Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  The BRST quantization of a gauge theory in noncommutative geometry is carried
out in the ``matrix derivative" approach. BRST/anti-BRST transformation rules
are obtained by applying the horizontality condition, in the superconnection
formalism. A BRST/anti-BRST invariant quantum action is then constructed, using
an adaptation of the method devised by Baulieu and Thierry-Mieg for the
Yang-Mills case. The resulting quantum action turns out to be the same as that
of a gauge theory in the 't Hooft gauge with spontaneously broken symmetry. Our
result shows that only the even part of the supergroup acts as a gauge
symmetry, while the odd part effectively provides a global symmetry. We treat
the general formalism first, then work out the $SU(2/1)$ and $SU(2/2)$ cases
explicitly.
