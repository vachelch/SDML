A G_2 Unification of the Deformed and Resolved Conifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We find general first-order equations for G_2 metrics of cohomogeneity one
with S^3\times S^3 principal orbits. These reduce in two special cases to
previously-known systems of first-order equations that describe regular
asymptotically locally conical (ALC) metrics \bB_7 and \bD_7, which have
weak-coupling limits that are S^1 times the deformed conifold and the resolved
conifold respectively. Our more general first-order equations provide a
supersymmetric unification of the two Calabi-Yau manifolds, since the metrics
\bB_7 and \bD_7 arise as solutions of the {\it same} system of first-order
equations, with different values of certain integration constants.
Additionally, we find a new class of ALC G_2 solutions to these first-order
equations, which we denote by \wtd\bC_7, whose topology is an \R^2 bundle over
T^{1,1}. There are two non-trivial parameters characterising the homogeneous
squashing of the T^{1,1} bolt. Like the previous examples of the \bB_7 and
\bD_7 ALC metrics, here too there is a U(1) isometry for which the circle has
everywhere finite and non-zero length. The weak-coupling limit of the \wtd\bC_7
metrics gives S^1 times a family of Calabi-Yau metrics on a complex line bundle
over S^2\times S^2, with an adjustable parameter characterising the relative
sizes of the two S^2 factors.
