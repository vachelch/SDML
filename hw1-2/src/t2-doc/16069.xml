Supergravity Dual of Noncommutative N=1 SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the noncommutative deformation of the Maldacena-Nunez
supergravity solution. The background describes a bound state of D5-D3 branes
wrapping an S^2 inside a Calabi-Yau three-fold, and in the presence of a
magnetic B-field. The dual field theory in the IR is a N=1 U(N) SYM theory with
spatial noncommutativity. We show that, under certain conditions, the massive
Kaluza-Klein states can be decoupled and that UV/IR mixing seems to be visible
in our solution. By calculating the quark-antiquark potential via the Wilson
loop we show confinement in the IR and strong repulsion at closer distances. We
also compute the beta-function and show that it coincides with the recently
calculated commutative one.
