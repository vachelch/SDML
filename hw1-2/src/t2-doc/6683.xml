The Master Field for Large $N$ Matrix Models and Quantum Groups
</title>

<abstract>
In recent works by Singer, Douglas and Gopakumar and Gross an application of
results of Voiculescu from non-commutative probability theory to constructions
of the master field for large $N$ matrix field theories have been suggested. In
this note we consider interrelations between the master field and quantum
groups. We define the master field algebra and observe that it is isomorphic to
the algebra of functions on the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ for $q=0$. The master
field becomes a central element of the quantum group Hopf algebra. The quantum
Haar measure on the $SU_q(2)$ for any $q$ gives the Wigner semicircle
distribution for the master field. Coherent states on $SU_q(2)$ become coherent
states in the master field theory.
