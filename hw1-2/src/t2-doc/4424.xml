On the interactions of Skyrmions with domain walls
</title>

<abstract>
  We study classical solutions of a particular version of the modified Skyrme
model in (3+1) dimensions. The model possesses Skyrmion solutions as well as
stable domain walls that connect different vacua of the theory. We show that
there is an attractive interaction between Skyrmions and domain walls. Thus
Skyrmions can be captured by the domain walls. We show also that, when the mass
term is of a special type, the model possesses bound states of Skyrmions and of
the domain wall. They look like deformed 2-dimensional Skyrmions captured by
the wall. The field configurations of these solutions can interpreted as having
come from the evolution of the 3-dimensional Skyrmions captured by the domain
wall. For more conventional choices of the mass term of the model in the model
the attraction between the Skyrmions and the wall leads to the capture of the
Skyrmions which are then turned into topological waves which spread out on the
wall. We have observed, numerically, such captures and the emission of the
waves.
  We speculate that this observation may be useful in the explanation of the
problem of baryogenesis and baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the Universe.
