Actions for Biconformal Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend 2n-dim biconformal gauge theory by including Lorentz-scalar matter
fields of arbitrary conformal weight. For a massless scalar field of conformal
weight zero in a torsion-free biconformal geometry, the solution is determined
by the Einstein equation on an n-dim submanifold, with the stress-energy tensor
of the scalar field as source. The matter field satisfies the n-dim
Klein-Gordon equation.
