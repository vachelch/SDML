A proposal for a manifestly gauge invariant and universal calculus in
  Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We uncover a method of calculation that proceeds at every step without fixing
the gauge or specifying details of the regularisation scheme. Results are
obtained by iterated use of integration by parts and gauge invariance
identities. The initial stages can even be computed diagrammatically. The
method is formulated within the framework of an exact renormalization group for
SU(N) Yang-Mills gauge theory, incorporating an effective cutoff through a
manifest spontaneously broken SU(N|N) gauge invariance. We demonstrate the
technique with a compact calculation of the one-loop beta function, achieving a
manifestly universal result, and without gauge fixing, for the first time at
finite N.
