A Search for Non-Perturbative Dualities of Local $N=2$ Yang--Mills
  Theories from Calabi--Yau Threefolds

<abstract>
  The generalisation of the rigid special geometry of the vector multiplet
quantum moduli space to the case of supergravity is discussed through the
notion of a dynamical Calabi--Yau threefold. Duality symmetries of this
manifold are connected with the analogous dualities associated with the
dynamical Riemann surface of the rigid theory. N=2 rigid gauge theories are
reviewed in a framework ready for comparison with the local case. As a
byproduct we give in general the full duality group (quantum monodromy) for an
arbitrary rigid $SU(r+1)$ gauge theory, extending previous explicit
constructions for the $r=1,2$ cases. In the coupling to gravity, R--symmetry
and monodromy groups of the dynamical Riemann surface, whose structure we
discuss in detail, are embedded into the symplectic duality group $\Gamma_D$
associated with the moduli space of the dynamical Calabi--Yau threefold.
