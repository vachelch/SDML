Soliton Spectrum of Integrable Models with Local Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  The soliton spectrum (massive and massless) of a family of integrable models
with local U(1) and U(1)\otimes U(1) symmetries is studied. These models
represent relevant integrable deformations of SL(2,R) \otimes U(1)^{n-1} - WZW
and SL(2,R) \otimes SL(2,R)\otimes U(1)^{n-2} - WZW models. Their massless
solitons appears as specific topological solutions of the U(1) (or U(1)\otimes
U(1)) - CFTs. The nonconformal analog of the GKO-coset formula is derived and
used in the construction of the composite massive solitons of the ungauged
integrable models.
