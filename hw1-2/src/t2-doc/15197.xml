Exact self-gravitating N-body motion in the CGHS model
</title>

<abstract>
  In the asymptotically flat two-dimensional dilaton gravity, we present an
N-body particle action which has a dilaton coupled mass term for the exact
solubility. This gives nonperturbative exact solutions for the N-body
self-gravitating system, so the infalling particles form a black hole and their
trajectories are exactly described. In our two-dimensional case, the critical
mass for the formation of black holes does not exist, so even a single particle
forms a black hole, which means that we can treat many black holes. The
infalling particles give additional time-like singularities in addition to the
space-like black hole singularity. However, the latter singularities can be
properly cloaked by the future horizons within some conditions.
