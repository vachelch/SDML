Penrose Limit of AdS_4 x N^{0,1,0} and N=3 Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider M-theory on AdS_4 x N^{0,1,0} where N^{0,1,0}= (SU(3) x
SU(2))/(SU(2) x U(1)). We review a Penrose limit of AdS_4 x N^{0,1,0} that
provides the pp-wave geometry of AdS_4 x S^7. There exists a subsector of three
dimensional N=3 dual gauge theory, by taking both the conformal dimension and
R-charge large with the finiteness of their difference, which has enhanced N=8
maximal supersymmetry. We identify operators in the N=3 gauge theory with
supergravity KK excitations in the pp-wave geometry and describe how the N=2
gauge theory operators originating from both N=3 short vector multiplet and N=3
long gravitino multiplet fall into N=8 supermultiplets.
