Perturbative Couplings and Modular Forms in N=2 String Models with a
  Wilson Line
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a class of four parameter D=4, N=2 string models, namely
heterotic strings compactified on K3 times T2 together with their dual type II
partners on Calabi-Yau three-folds. With the help of generalized modular forms
(such as Siegel and Jacobi forms), we compute the perturbative prepotential and
the perturbative Wilsonian gravitational coupling F1 for each of the models in
this class. We check heterotic/type II duality for one of the models by
relating the modular forms in the heterotic description to the known instanton
numbers in the type II description. We comment on the relation of our results
to recent proposals for closely related models.
