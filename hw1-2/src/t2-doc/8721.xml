Irreducible Hamiltonian BRST approach to topologically coupled abelian
  forms

<abstract>
  An irreducible Hamiltonian BRST approach to topologically coupled p- and
(p+1)-forms is developed. The irreducible setting is enforced by means of
constructing an irreducible Hamiltonian first-class model that is equivalent
from the BRST point of view to the original redundant theory. The irreducible
path integral can be brought to a manifestly Lorentz covariant form.
