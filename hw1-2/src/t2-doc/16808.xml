Self Duality and Oblique Confinement in Planar Gauge Theories.
</title>

<abstract>
We investigate the non-perturbative structure of two planar $Z_p \times Z_p$
lattice gauge models and discuss their relevance to two-dimensional condensed
matter systems and Josephson junction arrays. Both models involve two compact
$U(1)$ gauge fields with Chern-Simons interactions, which break the symmetry
down to $Z_p \times Z_p$. By identifying the relevant topological excitations
(instantons) and their interactions we determine the phase structure of the
models. Our results match observed quantum phase transitions in Josephson
junction arrays and suggest also the possibility of {\it oblique confining
ground states} corresponding to quantum Hall regimes for either charges or
vortices.
