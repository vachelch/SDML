A note on brane boxes at finite string coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider N=1 supersymmetric SU(N_c) gauge theories, using the type IIB
brane construction recently proposed by Hanany and Zaffaroni. At non-zero
string coupling, we find that the bending of branes imposes consistency
conditions that allow only non-anomalous gauge theories with stable vacua,
i.e., N_f >= N_c, to be constructed. We find qualitative differences between
the brane configurations for N_f <= 3N_c and N_f > 3N_c, corresponding to
asymptotically free and infrared free theories respectively. We also discuss
some properties of the brane configurations that may be relevant to
constructing Seiberg's duality in this framework.
