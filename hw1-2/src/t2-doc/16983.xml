Lattice Ising model in a field: E$_8$ scattering theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Zamolodchikov found an integrable field theory related to the Lie algebra
E$_8$, which describes the scaling limit of the Ising model in a magnetic
field. He conjectured that there also exist solvable lattice models based on
E$_8$ in the universality class of the Ising model in a field. The dilute A$_3$
model is a solvable lattice model with a critical point in the Ising
universality class. The parameter by which the model can be taken away from the
critical point acts like a magnetic field by breaking the $\Integer_2$ symmetry
between the states. The expected direct relation of the model with E$_8$ has
not been found hitherto. In this letter we study the thermodynamics of the
dilute A$_3$ model and show that in the scaling limit it exhibits an
appropriate E$_8$ structure, which naturally leads to the E$_8$ scattering
theory for massive excitations over the ground state.
