BPS States in Superstrings with Spontaneously Broken SUSY
</title>

<abstract>
  We show the existence of a supersymmetry-breaking mechanism in string theory,
where N=4 supersymmetry is broken spontaneously to N=2 and N=1 with
moduli-dependent gravitino masses. The BPS spectrum of the theory with lower
supersymmetry is in one-to-one correspondence with the spectrum of the
heterotic N=4 string. The mass splitting of the N=4 spectrum depends on the
moduli as well as the three R-symmetry charges. In the case of N=4 \to N=2, the
perturbative N=2 prepotential is determined by the perturbative N=4 BPS states.
This observation led us to suggest a method that determines the exact
non-perturbative prepotential of the effective N=2 supergravity using the
shifted spectrum of the non-perturbative BPS states of the underlying N=4
theory.
