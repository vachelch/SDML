A search for exact superstring vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate $2d$ sigma-models with a $2+N$ dimensional Minkowski signature
target space metric and Killing symmetry, specifically supersymmetrized, and
see under which conditions they might lead to corresponding exact string vacua.
It appears that the issue relies heavily on the properties of the vector
$M_{\mu}$, a reparametrization term, which needs to possess a definite form for
the Weyl invariance to be satisfied. We give, in the $n = 1$ supersymmetric
case, two non-renormalization theorems from which we can relate the $u$
component of $M_{\mu}$ to the $\beta^G_{uu}$ function. We work out this $(u,u)$
component of the $\beta^G$ function and find a non-vanishing contribution at
four loops. Therefore, it turns out that at order $\alpha^{\prime 4}$, there
are in general non-vanishing contributions to $M_u$ that prevent us from
deducing superstring vacua in closed form.
