A Systematic Approach to Confinement in N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We give necessary criteria for N=1 supersymmetric theories to be in a
smoothly confining phase without chiral symmetry breaking and with a
dynamically generated superpotential. Using our general arguments we find all
such confining SU and Sp theories with a single gauge group and no tree level
superpotential.
