Implicit Regularisation Technique: Calculation of the Two-loop
  $\phi^4_4$-theory $\beta$-function
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an implicit regularisation scheme. The main advantage is that
since no explicit use of a regulator is made, one can in principle avoid
undesirable symmetry violations related to its choice. The divergent amplitudes
are split into basic divergent integrals which depend only on the loop momenta
and finite integrals. The former can be absorbed by a renormalisation procedure
whereas the latter can be evaluated without restrictions. We illustrate with
the calculation of the $QED$ and $\phi^4_4$-theory $\beta$-function to one and
two-loop order, respectively.
