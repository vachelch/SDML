Fate of Kaluza-Klein Bubble
</title>

<abstract>
  We numerically study classical time evolutions of Kaluza-Klein bubble
space-time which has negative energy after a decay of vacuum. As the zero
energy Witten's bubble space-time, where the bubble expands infinitely, the
subsequent evolutions of Brill and Horowitz's momentarily static initial data
show that the bubble will expand in terms of the area. At first glance, this
result may support Corley and Jacobson's conjecture that the bubble will expand
forever as well as the Witten's bubble. The irregular signatures, however, can
be seen in the behavior of the lapse function in the maximal slicing gauge and
the divergence of the Kretchman invariant. Since there is no appearance of the
apparent horizon, we suspect an appearance of a naked singularity as the final
fate of this space-time.
