The Operator Product Expansion of N=4 SYM and the 4-point Functions of
  Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a detailed Operator Product Expansion interpretation of the results
for conformal 4-point functions computed from supergravity through the AdS/CFT
duality. We show that for an arbitrary scalar exchange in AdS(d+1) all the
power-singular terms in the direct channel limit (and only these terms) exactly
match the corresponding contributions to the OPE of the operator dual to the
exchanged bulk field and of its conformal descendents. The leading logarithmic
singularities in the 4-point functions of protected N=4 super-Yang Mills
operators (computed from IIB supergravity on AdS(5) X S(5) are interpreted as
O(1/N^2) renormalization effects of the double-trace products appearing in the
OPE. Applied to the 4-point functions of the operators Ophi ~ tr F^2 + ... and
Oc ~ tr FF~ + ..., this analysis leads to the prediction that the double-trace
composites [Ophi Oc] and [Ophi Ophi - Oc Oc] have anomalous dimension -16/N^2
in the large N, large g_{YM}^2 N limit. We describe a geometric picture of the
OPE in the dual gravitational theory, for both the power-singular terms and the
leading logarithms. We comment on several possible extensions of our results.
