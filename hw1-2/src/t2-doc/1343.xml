Classical dynamics in deformed spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a 3-parametric linear deformation of the Poisson brackets in
classical mechanics. This deformation can be thought of as the classical limit
of dynamics in so-called "quantized spaces". Our main result is a description
of the motion of a particle in the corresponding Kepler-Coulomb problem.
