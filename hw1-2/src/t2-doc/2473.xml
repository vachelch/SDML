An Extended Abelian Chern-Simons Model and the Symplectic Projector
  Method
</title>

<abstract>
  The Symplectic Projector Method is applied to discuss quantisation aspects of
an extended Abelian model with a pair of gauge potentials coupled by means of a
mixed Chern-Simons term. We focuss on a field content that spans an N=2-D=3
supersymmetric theory whenever scalar and fermionic matter is suitably coupled
to the family of gauge potentials.
