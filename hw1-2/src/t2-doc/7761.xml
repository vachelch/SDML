Motions of the String Solutions in the XXZ Spin Chain under a Varying
  Twist
</title>

<abstract>
  We determine the motions of the roots of the Bethe ansatz equation for the
ground state in the XXZ spin chain under a varying twist angle. This is done by
analytic as well as numerical study at a finite size system. In the attractive
critical regime $ 0< \Delta <1 $, we reveal intriguing motions of strings due
to the finite size corrections to the length of the strings: in the case of
two-strings, the roots collide into the branch points perpendicularly to the
imaginary axis, while in the case of three-strings, they fluctuate around the
center of the string. These are successfully generalized to the case of
$n$-string. These results are used to determine the final configuration of the
momenta as well as that of the phase shift functions. We obtain these as well
as the period and the Berry phase also in the regime $ \Delta \leq -1$,
establishing the continuity of the previous results at $ -1 < \Delta < 0 $ to
this regime. We argue that the Berry phase can be used as a measure of the
statistics of the quasiparticle ( or the bound state) involved in the process.
