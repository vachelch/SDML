Topological Conformal Algebra in $2d$ Gravity Coupled to Minimal Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  An infinite number of topological conformal algebras with varying central
charges are explicitly shown to be present in $2d$ gravity (treated both in the
conformal gauge and in the light-cone gauge) coupled to minimal matter. The
central charges of the underlying $N=2$ theory in two different gauge choices
are generically found to be different. The physical states in these theories
are briefly discussed in the light of the $N=2$ superconformal symmetry.
