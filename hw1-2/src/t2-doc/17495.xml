Cosmological constant and Brane New World
</title>

<abstract>
  The estimation of the cosmological constant in inflationary Brane New World
models is done. It is shown that basically it is quite large, of the same order
as in anomaly-driven inflation. However, for some fine-tuning of bulk
gravitational constant and AdS scale parameter $l^2$ it may be reduced to
sufficiently small value. Bulk higher derivative AdS gravity with quantum brane
matter may also serve as the model where small positive cosmological constant
occurs.
