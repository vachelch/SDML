Spin Chain Hamiltonians with Affine $U_q g$ symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the family of spin chain Hamiltonians, which have affine $U_q g$
guantum group symmetry. Their eigenvalues coincides with the eigenvalues of the
usual spin chain Hamiltonians which have non-affine $U_q g_0$ quantum group
symmetry, but have the degeneracy of levels, corresponding to affine $U_q g$.
The space of states of these chaines are formed by the tensor product of the
fully reducible representations.
