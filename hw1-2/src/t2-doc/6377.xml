Absence of a charge renormalization in the Higgs model interacting with
  conformal two-dimensional gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss D-dimensional scalar and electromagnetic fields interacting with a
quantized metric. The gravitons depend solely on twodimensional coordinates. We
consider a conformal field theory model for the metric tensor. We show that an
interaction with gravity improves the short distance behaviour. As a result
there is no charge renormalization in the fourdimensional Higgs model.
