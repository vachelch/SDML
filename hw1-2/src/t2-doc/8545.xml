Physical Degrees of Freedom in 2-D String Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  States in the absolute (semi-relative) cohomology but not in the relative
cohomology are examined through the component decomposition of the string field
theory action for the 2-D string. It is found that they are auxiliary fields
without kinetic terms, but are important for instance in the master equation
for the Ward-Takahashi identities. The ghost structure is analyzed in the
Siegel gauge, but it is noted that the absolute (semi-relative) cohomology
states are lost.
