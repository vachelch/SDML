Background field boundary conditions for affine Toda field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Classical integrability is investigated for affine Toda field theories in the
presence of a constant background tensor field. This leads to a further set of
discrete possibilities for integrable boundary conditions depending upon the
time-derivative of the fields at the boundary but containing no free parameters
other than the bulk coupling constant.
