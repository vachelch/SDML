N = 2 supergravity models with gauge Kac-Moody groups
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we consider a class of models for vector and hypermultiplets,
interacting with $N=2$ supergravity, with gauge groups being an
infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody groups. It is shown that specific properties of
Kac-Moody groups, allowing the introduction of the vector fields masses without
the usual Higgs mechanism, make it possible to break simultaneously both the
supersymmetry and the gauge symmetry. Also, a kind of inverse Higgs mechanism
can be realized, that is, in the considered model there exists a possibility to
lower masses of the scalar fields, which usually acquire huge masses as a
result of supersymmetry breaking. That allows one to use them, for example, as
Higgs fields at the second step of the gauge symmetry breaking in the unified
models.
