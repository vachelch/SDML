Low Momentum Scattering in the Dirac Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the amplitude for reflection of a Dirac particle with
arbitrarily low momentum incident on a potential of finite range is -1 and
hence the transmission coefficient T=0 in general. If however the potential
supports a half-bound state at k=0 this result does not hold. In the case of an
asymmetric potential the transmission coefficient T will be non-zero whilst for
a symmetric potential T=1.
