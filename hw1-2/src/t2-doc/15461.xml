New Numerical Methods for Iterative or Perturbative Solution of Quantum
  Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A new computational idea for continuum quantum field theories is outlined.
This approach is based on the lattice source Galerkin methods developed by
Garcia, Guralnik and Lawson. The method has many promising features including
treating fermions on a relatively symmetric footing with bosons. As a spinoff
of the technology developed for ``exact'' solutions, the numerical methods used
have a special case application to perturbation theory. We are in the process
of developing an entirely numerical approach to evaluating graphs to high
perturbative order.
