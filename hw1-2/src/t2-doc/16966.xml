  Charged scalar field is quantized in the background of a static d-2 - brane
which is a core of the magnetic flux lines in flat d+1 - dimensional
space-time. We find that vector potential of the magnetic core induces the
energy-momentum tensor in the vacuum. The tensor components are periodic
functions of the brane flux and holomorphic functions of space dimension. The
dependence on the distance from the brane and on the coupling to the space-time
curvature scalar is comprehensively analysed.
