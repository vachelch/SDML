Born-Again Braneworld
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a cosmological braneworld scenario in which two branes collide and
emerge as reborn branes with signs of tensions opposite to the original
tensions of respective branes. In this scenario, gravity on each of the branes
is described by a scalar-tensor type theory in which the radion plays the role
of the gravitational scalar, and the branes are assumed to be inflating.
However, the whole dynamics is different from the usual inflation due to the
non-trivial dynamics of the radion field. Transforming the conformal frame to
the Einstein frame, this born-again scenario resembles the pre-big-bang
scenario. Thus our scenario has features of both inflation and pre-big-bang
scenarios. In particular, the gravitational waves produced from vacuum
fluctuations will have a very blue spectrum, while the inflaton field will give
rise to a standard scale-invariant spectrum.
