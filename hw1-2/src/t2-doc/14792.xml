Non-minimal couplings in two dimensional gravity: a quantum
  investigation
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the quantum effects of the non-minimal matter-gravity
couplings derived by Cangemi and Jackiw in the realm of a specific fermionic
theory, namely the abelian Thirring model on a Riemann surface of genus
zero and one. The structure and the strength of the new interactions are seen
to be highly constrained, when the topology of the underlying manifold is taken
into account. As a matter of fact, by requiring to have a well-defined action,
we are led both to quantization rules for the coupling constants and to
selection rules for the correlation functions. Explicit quantum computations
are carried out in genus one (torus). In particular the two-point function and
the chiral condensate are carefully derived for this case. Finally the
effective gravitational action, coming from integrating out the fermionic
degrees of freedoom, is presented. It is different from the standard Liouville
one: a new non-local functional of the conformal factor arises and the central
charge is improved, depending also on the Thirring coupling constant. This last
feature opens the possibility of giving a new explicit representation of the
minimal series in terms of a fermionic interacting model.
