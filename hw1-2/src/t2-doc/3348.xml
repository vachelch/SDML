U-duality p-Branes in Diverse Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  U-duality p-branes in toroidally compactified type II superstring theories in
space-time dimensions $10 > D \ge 4$ can be constructed explicitly based on the
conjectured U-duality symmetries and the corresponding known single-charge
super p-brane configurations. As concrete examples, we first construct
explicitly the $SL(3, Z)$ superstrings and $SL(3, Z) \times SL(2, Z)$ 0-branes
as well as their corresponding magnetic duals in $D = 8$. For the $SL(3, Z)$
superstrings (3-branes), each of them is characterized by a triplet of integers
corresponding to the electric-like (magnetic-like) charges associated with the
three 2-form gauge potentials present in the theory. For the $SL(3, Z)\times
SL(2,Z)$ 0-branes (4-branes), each of them is labelled by a pair of triplets of
integers corresponding to the electric-like (magnetic-like) charges associated
with the two sets of three 1-form gauge potentials. The string (3-brane)
tension and central charge are shown to be given by $SL(3, Z)$ invariant
expressions. It is argued that when any two of the three integers in the
integral triplet are relatively prime to each other, the corresponding string
(3-brane) is stable and does not decay into multiple strings (3-branes) by a
`tension gap' or `charge gap' equation. Similar results hold also for the
0-branes (4-branes). Alongwith the $SL(2, Z)$ dyonic membranes of Izquierdo et.
al., these examples provide a further support for the conjectured $SL(3, Z)
\times SL(2, Z)$ U-duality symmetry in this theory. Moreover, the study of
these examples along with the previous ones provides us a recipe for
constructing the U-duality p-branes of various supergravity theories in diverse
dimensions. Constructions for these U-duality p-branes are also given.
