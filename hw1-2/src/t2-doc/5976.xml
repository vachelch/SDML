Universality or Non--Universality of Absorption Cross Sections for
  Extended Objects
</title>

<abstract>
  The calculation of absorption cross sections for minimal scalars in
supergravity backgrounds is an important aspect of the investigation of AdS/CFT
correspondence and requires a matching of appropriate wave functions. The low
energy case has attracted particular attention. In the following the dependence
of the cross section on the matching point is investigated. It is shown that
the low energy limit is independent of the matching point and hence exhibits
universality. In the high energy limit the independence is not maintained, but
the result is believed to possess the correct energy dependence.
