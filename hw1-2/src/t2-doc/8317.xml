Representations of q-Minkowski space algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The properties of the quantum Minkowski space algebra are discussed. Its
irreducible representations with highest weight vectors are constructed and
relations to other quantum algebras: $su_{q}(2)$, $q$-oscillator, $q$-sphere
are pointed out.
