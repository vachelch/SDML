On Nonperturbative Solutions of Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Nonperturbative solutions to the nonlinear field equations in the NS sector
of cubic as well as nonpolynomial superstring field theory can be obtained from
a linear equation which includes a "spectral" parameter \lambda and a
coboundary operator Q(\lambda). We borrow a simple ansatz from the dressing
method (for generating solitons in integrable field theories) and show that
classical superstring fields can be constructed from any string field T subject
merely to Q(\lambda)T=0. Following the decay of the non-BPS D9 brane in IIA
theory and shifting the background to the tachyon vacuum, we repeat the
arguments in vacuum superstring field theory and outline how to compute
classical solutions explicitly.
