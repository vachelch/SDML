Equivalence Principle, Planck Length and Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi
  Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The Quantum Stationary HJ Equation (QSHJE) that we derived from the
equivalence principle, gives rise to initial conditions which cannot be seen in
the Schroedinger equation. Existence of the classical limit leads to a
dependence of the integration constant $\ell=\ell_1+i\ell_2$ on the Planck
length. Solutions of the QSHJE provide a trajectory representation of quantum
mechanics which, unlike Bohm's theory, has a non-trivial action even for bound
states and no wave guide is present. The quantum potential turns out to be an
intrinsic potential energy of the particle which, similarly to the relativistic
rest energy, is never vanishing.
