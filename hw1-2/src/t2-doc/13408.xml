Exact Solution of a Boundary Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the conformal field theory of a free massless scalar field living on
the half line with interactions introduced via a periodic potential at the
boundary. An $SU(2)$ current algebra underlies this system and the interacting
boundary state is given by a global $SU(2)$ rotation of the left-moving fields
in the zero-potential (Neumann) boundary state. As the potential strength
varies from zero to infinity, the boundary state interpolates between the
Neumann and the Dirichlet values. The full S-matrix for scattering from the
boundary, with arbitrary particle production, is explicitly computed. To
maintain unitarity, it is necessary to attribute a hidden discrete ``soliton''
degree of freedom to the boundary. The same unitarity puzzle occurs in the
Kondo problem, and we anticipate a similar solution.
