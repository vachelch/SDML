The Mass Spectrum of N=1 SYM(2+1) at Strong Coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R x S^1 x S^1. In particular,
we choose one of the compact directions to be light-like and another to be
space-like. Since the SDLCQ regularization explicitly preserves supersymmetry,
this theory is totally finite, and thus we can solve for bound state wave
functions and masses numerically without renormalizing. We present the masses
as functions of the longitudinal and transverse resolutions and show that the
masses converge rapidly in both resolutions. We also study the behavior of the
spectrum as a function of the coupling and find that at strong coupling there
is a stable, well defined spectrum which we present. We also find several
unphysical states that decouple at large transverse resolution. There are two
sets of massless states; one set is massless only at zero coupling and the
other is massless at all couplings. Together these sets of massless states are
in one-to-one correspondence with the full spectrum of the dimensionally
reduced theory.
