Gauging the Full R-Symmetry Group in Five-dimensional, N=2
  Yang-Mills/Einstein/tensor Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that certain five dimensional, N=2 Yang-Mills/Einstein supergravity
theories admit the gauging of the full R-symmetry group, SU(2)_R, of the
underlying N=2 Poincare superalgebra. This generalizes the previously studied
Abelian gaugings of U(1)_R subgroup of SU(2)_R and completes the construction
of the most general vector and tensor field coupled five dimensional N=2
supergravity theories with gauge interactions. The gauging of SU(2)_R turns out
to be possible only in special cases, and leads to a new type of scalar
potential. For a large class of these theories the potential does not have any
critical points.
