p-Brane Dyons and Electric-magnetic Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss dyons, charge quantization and electric-magnetic duality for
self-interacting, abelian, p-form theories in the spacetime dimensions D=2(p+1)
where dyons can be present. The corresponding quantization conditions and
duality properties are strikingly different depending on whether p is odd or
even. If p is odd one has the familiar eg'-ge'= 2nh, whereas for even p one
finds the opposite relative sign, eg'+ge'= 2nh. These conditions are obtained
by introducing Dirac strings and taking due account of the multiple
connectedness of the configuration space of the strings and the dyons. A
two-potential formulation of the theory that treats the electric and magnetic
sources on the same footing is also given.
 Our results hold for arbitrary gauge invariant self-interaction of the fields
and are valid irrespective of their duality properties.
