Curved Membrane Solutions in D=11 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a class of static membrane solutions, with non-flat worldvolume
geometry, in the eleven dimensional supergravity with source terms. This class
of solutions contains supersymmetric as well as a large class of
non-supersymmetric configurations. We comment about near horizon limit and
stability of these solutions and point out an interesting relation with certain
two dimensional dilaton gravity system.
