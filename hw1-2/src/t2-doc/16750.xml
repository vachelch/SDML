Quantum field fluctuations and chaotic dynamics of model Yang-Mills
  system
</title>

<abstract>
  On example of the model field system we demonstrate that quantum fluctuations
of non-abelian gauge fields leading to radiative corrections to Higgs potential
and spontaneous symmetry breaking can generate order region in phase space of
inherently chaotic classical field system. We demonstrate on the example of
another model field system that quantum fluctuations do not influence on the
chaotic dynamics of non-abelian Yang--Mills fields if the ratio of bare
coupling constants of Yang--Mills and Higgs fields is larger then some critical
value. This critical value is estimated.
