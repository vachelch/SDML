On The Strong-Coupling Spectrum of Pure SU(3) Seiberg-Witten Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the two complex dimensional moduli space of supersymmetric vacua
for low energy effective N=2 SYM with gauge group SU(3). We describe, at the
topological level, a consistent model of how the relevant curves of marginal
stability (CMS) intertwine with the branch cuts to partition the moduli space
into pieces carrying different BPS spectra. At strong coupling we find
connected cores which carry a smaller BPS spectrum than that at weak coupling.
At the strongest coupling we find double cores which carry a finite BPS
spectrum. These include not only states one can deduce from the monodromy
group, but three states, bounded away from weak coupling, each of which we
interpret as a bound state of two BPS gauge bosons. We find new BPS states at
weak coupling corresponding to a excitations of a state with magnetic charge a
simple co-root, with respect to the other simple root direction.
