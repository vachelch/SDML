Octonionic Gravitational Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct eight-dimensional gravitational instantons by solving
appropriate self-duality equations for the spin-connection. The particular
gravitational instanton we present has $Spin(7)$ holonomy and, in a sense, it
is the eight-dimensional analog of the Eguchi-Hanson 4D space. It has a
removable bolt singularity which is topologically S^4 and its boundary at
infinity is the squashed S^7. We also lift our solutions to ten and eleven
dimensions and construct fundamental string and membrane configurations that
preserve 1/16 of the original supersymmetries.
