Open String/Open D-Brane Dualities: Old and New
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine magnetic and electric near horizon regions of maximally
supersymmetric D-brane and NS5-brane bound states and find transformations
between near horizon regions with worldvolume dual magnetic and electric
fluxes. These point to dual formulations of NCYM, NCOS and OD$p$ theories in
the limit of weak coupling and large spatial or temporal non-commutativity
length scale in terms of weakly coupled theories with fixed worldvolume dual
non-commutativity based on open D-branes. We also examine the strong coupling
behavior of the open D-brane theories and propose a unified web of dualities
involving strong/weak coupling as well as large/small non-commutativity scale.
