Differential Equations for Feynman Graph Amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  It is by now well established that, by means of the integration by part
identities, all the integrals occurring in the evaluation of a Feynman graph of
given topology can be expressed in terms of a few independent master integrals.
It is shown in this paper that the integration by part identities can be
further used for obtaining a linear system of first order differential
equations for the master integrals themselves. The equations can then be used
for the numerical evaluation of the amplitudes as well as for investigating
their analytic properties, such as the asymptotic and threshold behaviours and
the corresponding expansions (and for analytic integration purposes, when
possible). The new method is illustrated through its somewhat detailed
application to the case of the one loop self-mass amplitude, by explicitly
working out expansions and quadrature formulas, both in arbitrary continuous
dimension n and in the n \to 4 limit. It is then shortly discussed which
features of the new method are expected to work in the more general case of
multi-point, multi-loop amplitudes.
