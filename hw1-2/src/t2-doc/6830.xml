Superfield Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a superfield formulation of the quantization program for theories
with first class constraints. An exact operator formulation is given, and we
show how to set up a phase-space path integral entirely in terms of
superfields. BRST transformations and canonical transformations enter on equal
footing, and they allow us to establish a superspace analog of the BFV theorem.
We also present a formal derivation of the Lagrangian superfield analogue of
the field-antifield formalism, by an integration over half of the phase-space
variables.
