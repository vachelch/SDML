Coherent State Induced Star-Product on $R^3_{\lambda}$ and the Fuzzy
  Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the Hopf fibration and starting from a four dimensional noncommutative
Moyal plane, $R^2_{\theta}\times R^2_{\theta}$, we obtain a star-product for
the noncommutative (fuzzy) $R^3_{\lambda}$ defined by
$[x^i,x^j]=i\lambda\epsilon_{ijk}x^k$. Furthermore, we show that there is a
projection function which allows us to reduce the functions on $R^3_{\lambda}$
to that of the fuzzy sphere, and hence we introduce a new star-product on the
fuzzy sphere. We will then briefly discuss how using our method one can extract
information about the field theory on fuzzy sphere and $\rrlam$ from the
corresponding field theories on $R_{theta}\times R_{\theta}$ space.
