Exact Combinatorics of Bern-Kosower-type Amplitudes for Two-Loop
  $\Phi^3$ Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Counting the contribution rate of a world-line formula to Feynman diagrams in
$\phi^3$ theory, we explain the idea how to determine precise combinatorics of
Bern-Kosower-like amplitudes derived from a bosonic string theory for $N$-point
two-loop Feynman amplitudes. In this connection we also present a method to
derive simple and compact world-line forms for the effective action.
