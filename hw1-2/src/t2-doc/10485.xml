String-Loop Corrections Versus Non-Extremality
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a magnetic black-hole solution to the equations of motion of the
string-loop-corrected effective action. At the string-tree level, this solution
is the extremal magnetic black hole described by the "chiral null model." In
the extremal case, the string-loop correction is constant, and this fact is
used to analytically solve the loop-corrected equations of motion. In
distinction to the tree-level solution, the resulting loop-corrected solution
has the horizon at a finite distance from the origin; its location is a
function of the loop correction. The loop-corrected configuration is compared
with a string-tree-level non-extremal magnetic black hole solution which also
has the horizon at a finite distance from the origin. We find that for an
appropriate choice of the free parameters of solutions, the loop-corrected
magnetic black hole can be approximated by a tree-level non-extremal solution.
We compare the thermodynamic properties of the loop-corrrected and non-extremal
solutions.
