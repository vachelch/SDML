On D-branes in Type 0 String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using boundary states we derive the presence of (chiral) fermions on the
intersection of type 0 D-branes. The corresponding anomalous couplings on the
branes are then computed. Furthermore, we discuss systems of branes sitting at
$A_n$ singularities. In particular, the massless spectrum on the branes is
derived, and a boundary state description is given.
