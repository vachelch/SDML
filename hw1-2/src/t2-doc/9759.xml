Two-Loop Superstrings II, The Chiral Measure on Moduli Space
</title>

<abstract>
  A detailed derivation from first principles is given for the unambiguous and
slice-independent formula for the two-loop superstring chiral measure which was
announced in the first paper of this series. Supergeometries are projected onto
their super period matrices, and the integration over odd supermoduli is
performed by integrating over the fibers of this projection. The subtleties
associated with this procedure are identified. They require the inclusion of
some new finite-dimensional Jacobian superdeterminants, a deformation of the
worldsheet correlation functions using the stress tensor, and perhaps
paradoxically, another additional gauge choice, ``slice \hat\mu choice'', whose
independence also has to be established. This is done using an important
correspondence between superholomorphic notions with respect to a supergeometry
and holomorphic notions with respect to its super period matrix. Altogether,
the subtleties produce precisely the corrective terms which restore the
independence of the resulting gauge-fixed formula under infinitesimal changes
of gauge-slice. This independence is a key criterion for any gauge-fixed
formula and hence is verified in detail.
