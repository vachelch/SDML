Expectation values of descendent fields in the sine-Gordon model
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain exactly the vacuum expectation values $<(\partial\phi)^2
({\bar\partial}\phi) e^{i\alpha\phi}>$ in the sine-Gordon model and 
$<L_{-2}{\bar L}_{-2} \Phi_{l,k}>$ in $\Phi_{1,3}$ perturbed minimal CFT. We
discuss applications of these results to short-distance expansions of two-point
correlation functions.
