Extended supersymmetry in D=1+1
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend superspace by introducing an antisymmetric tensorial coordinate.
The resulting theory presents a supersymmetry with central charge. After
integrating over the tensorial coordinate, an effective action describing
massive bosons and fermions is explicitely derived for the spacetime dimension
D=2. The adopted procedure is simpler than the Kaluza-Klein one and can suggest
an alternative for string compactifications.
