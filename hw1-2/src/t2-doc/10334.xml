Theta Dependence of Meson Masses in the Small Mass Limit of the Massive
  Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a continuum formulation for $\theta$-vacua in the massive
Schwinger model on the light-front, where $\theta$ enters as a background
electric field. The effective coupling of the external field is partially
screened due to vacuum polarization processes. For small fermion masses and
small $\theta$ we calculate the mass of the meson and find agreement with
results from bosonization.
