Three Dimensional Black Holes and Four Dimensional Black Strings as
  Nonlinear Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Two solutions of stringy gravity in three and four dimensions which admit
interpretation as a black hole and a black string, respectively, are discussed.
It is demonstrated that they are exact WZWN nonlinear sigma models to all
orders in the inverse string tension, and hence represent exact conformal field
theories on the world-sheet. Furthermore, since the dilaton for these two
solutions is constant, they also solve the equations of motion of standard GR
with a minimally coupled three form field strength. (Based on a talk presented
at the Conference on Quantum Aspects of Black Holes, U. of California, Santa
Barbara CA June 21-27 '93, and a poster presented at 5th Canadian Conference on
General Relativity and Relativistic Astrophysics, Waterloo, Ont., May 13-15,
1993.)
