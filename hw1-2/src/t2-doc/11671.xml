Manifestly supersymmetric M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, the low-energy effective dynamics of M-theory,
eleven-dimensional supergravity, is taken off-shell in a manifestly
supersymmetric formulation. We show that a previously proposed relaxation of
the superspace torsion constraints does indeed accommodate a current
supermultiplet which lifts the equations of motion corresponding to the
ordinary second order derivative supergravity lagrangian. Whether the auxiliary
fields obtained this way can be used to construct an off-shell lagrangian is
not yet known. We comment on the relation and application of this completely
general formalism to higher-derivative (R^4) corrections. Some details of the
calculation are saved for a later publication.
