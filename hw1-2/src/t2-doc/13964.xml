A possible way to relate the "covariantization" and the negative
  dimensional integration methods in the light cone gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we present a possible way to relate the method of covariantizing
the gauge dependent pole and the negative dimensional integration method for
computing Feynman integrals pertinent to the light-cone gauge fields. Both
techniques are applicable to the algebraic light-cone gauge and dispense with
prescriptions to treat the characteristic poles.
