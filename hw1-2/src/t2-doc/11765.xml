Hot String Soup

<abstract>
  Above the Hagedorn energy density closed fundamental strings form a long
string phase. The dynamics of weakly interacting long strings is described by a
simple Boltzmann equation which can be solved explicitly for equilibrium
distributions. The average total number of long strings grows logarithmically
with total energy in the microcanonical ensemble. This is consistent with
calculations of the free single string density of states provided the
thermodynamic limit is carefully defined. If the theory contains open strings
the long string phase is suppressed.
