Quantum radiation pressure on a moving mirror at finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the radiation pressure force on a moving mirror, in the
nonrelativistic approximation, assuming the field to be at temperature $T.$ At
high temperature, the force has a dissipative component proportional to the
mirror velocity, which results from Doppler shift of the reflected thermal
photons. In the case of a scalar field, the force has also a dispersive
component associated to a mass correction. In the electromagnetic case, the
separate contributions to the mass correction from the two polarizations
cancel. We also derive explicit results in the low temperature regime, and
present numerical results for the general case. As an application, we compute
the dissipation and decoherence rates for a mirror in a harmonic potential
well.
