A BRST Analysis of $W$-symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a classical BRST analysis of the symmetries corresponding to a
generic $w_N$-algebra. An essential feature of our method is that we write the
$w_N$-algebra in a special basis such that the algebra manifestly has a
``nested'' set of subalgebras $v_N^N \subset v_N^{N-1} \subset \dots \subset
v_N^2 \equiv w_N$ where the subalgebra $v_N^i\ (i=2, \dots ,N)$ consists of
generators of spin $s=\{i,i+1,\dots ,N\}$, respectively. In the new basis the
BRST charge can be written as a ``nested'' sum of $N-1$ nilpotent BRST charges.
In view of potential applications to (critical and/or non-critical) $W$-string
theories we discuss the quantum extension of our results. In particular, we
present the quantum BRST-operator for the $W_4$-algebra in the new basis. For
both critical and non-critical $W$-strings we apply our results to discuss the
relation with minimal models.
