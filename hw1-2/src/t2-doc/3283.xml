Poisson Algebra of Wilson Loops and Derivations of Free Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a finite analogue of the Poisson algebra of Wilson loops in
Yang-Mills theory. It is shown that this algebra arises in an apparently
completely different context; as a Lie algebra of vector fields on a
non-commutative space. This suggests that non-commutative geometry plays a
fundamental role in the manifestly gauge invariant formulation of Yang-Mills
theory. We also construct the deformation of the loop algebra induced by
quantization, in the large N_c limit.
