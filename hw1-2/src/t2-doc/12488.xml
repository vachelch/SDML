  The general one-dimensional ``log-sine'' gas is defined by restricting the
positive and negative charges of a two-dimensional Coulomb gas to live on a
circle. Depending on charge constraints, this problem is equivalent to
different boundary field theories. We study the electrically neutral case,
which is equivalent to a two-dimensional free boson with an impurity cosine
potential. We use two different methods: a perturbative one based on Jack
symmetric functions, and a non-perturbative one based on the thermodynamic
Bethe ansatz and functional relations. The first method allows us to compute
explicitly all coefficients in the virial expansion of the free energy and the
experimentally-measurable conductance. Some results for correlation functions
are also presented. The second method provides in particular a surprising
fluctuation-dissipation relation between the free energy and the conductance.
