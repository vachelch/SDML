(NS5,Dp) and (NS5,D(p+2),Dp) bound states of type IIB and type IIA
  string theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the (q,p) 5-brane solution of type IIB string theory, we here
construct the low energy configuration corresponding to (NS5,Dp)-brane bound
states (for $0\leq p\leq 4$) using the T-duality map between type IIB and type
IIA string theories. We use the SL(2,Z) symmetry on the type IIB bound state
(NS5,D3) to construct (NS5,D5,D3) bound state. We then apply T-duality
transformation again on this state to construct the bound states of the form
(NS5,D(p+2),Dp) (for $0\leq p\leq 2$) of both type IIB and type IIA string
theories. We give the tension formula for these states and show that they form
non-threshold bound states. All these states preserve half of the space-time
supersymmetries of string theories. We also briefly discuss the ODp-limits
corresponding to (NS5,Dp) bound state solutions.
