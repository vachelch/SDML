Planckian Scattering of D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the gravitational scattering of point particles in four
dimensions, at Planckian centre of mass energy and low momentum transfer, or
the eikonal approximation. The scattering amplitude can be exactly computed by
modelling point particles by very generic metrics. A class of such metrics are
black hole solutions obtained from dimensional reduction of p-brane solutions
with one or more Ramond-Ramond charges in string theory. At weak string
coupling, such black holes are replaced by a collection of wrapped D-branes.
Thus, we investigate eikonal scattering at weak coupling by modelling the point
particles by wrapped D-branes and show that the amplitudes exactly match the
corresponding amplitude found at strong coupling. We extend the calculation for
scattering of charged particles.
