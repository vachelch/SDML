On the SU(1,1) Thermal Group of Bosonic Strings and D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  All possible Bogoliubov operators that generate the thermal transformations
in the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) form a SU(1,1) group. We discuss this
contruction in the bosonic string theory. In particular, the transformation of
the Fock space and string operators generated by the most general SU(1,1)
unitary Bogoliubov transformation and the entropy of the corresponding thermal
string are computed. Also, we construct the thermal $D$-brane solution
generated by the SU(1,1) transformation in a constant Kalb-Ramond field and
compute its entropy.
