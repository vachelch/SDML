Two-Loop Superstrings IV, The Cosmological Constant and Modular Forms
</title>

<abstract>
  The slice-independent gauge-fixed superstring chiral measure in genus 2
derived in the earlier papers of this series for each spin structure is
evaluated explicitly in terms of theta-constants. The slice-independence allows
an arbitrary choice of superghost insertion points q_1, q_2 in the explicit
evaluation, and the most effective one turns out to be the split gauge defined
by S_{\delta}(q_1,q_2)=0. This results in expressions involving bilinear
theta-constants M. The final formula in terms of only theta-constants follows
from new identities between M and theta-constants which may be interesting in
their own right. The action of the modular group Sp(4,Z) is worked out
explicitly for the contribution of each spin structure to the superstring
chiral measure. It is found that there is a unique choice of relative phases
which insures the modular invariance of the full chiral superstring measure,
and hence a unique way of implementing the GSO projection for even spin
structure. The resulting cosmological constant vanishes, not by a Riemann
identity, but rather by the genus 2 identity expressing any modular form of
weight 8 as the square of a modular form of weight 4. The degeneration limits
for the contribution of each spin structure are determined, and the
divergences, before the GSO projection, are found to be the ones expected on
physical grounds.
