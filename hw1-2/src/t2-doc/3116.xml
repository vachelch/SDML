Non-BPS Branes in a Type I Orbifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the spectrum of non-BPS branes in the type I theory on the
orbifold $T^4/{\cal I}_4$. We present a detailed analysis of the action of the
worldsheet parity $\Omega$ on the different D-brane boundary state sectors of
type IIB on $T^4/{\cal I}_4$, using the covariant formulation. Using these
results we derive the spectrum of branes in the type I orbifold. We find
$\Z_2$- and $\Z$- charged non-BPS branes. A study of the stability of these
branes in the type I orbifold is also presented. We find that the type I
non-BPS D-particle and D-instanton remain stable in the orbifold. The
D-particle carries no charge whereas the non-BPS D-instanton can carry twisted
R-R charge.
