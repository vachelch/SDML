The Lamb Shift in a Light Front Hamiltonian Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  Light-front Hamiltonian methods are being developed to attack bound-state
problems in QCD. In this paper we advance the state of the art for these
methods by computing the well-known Lamb shift in hydrogen starting from first
principles of QED. There are obvious but significant qualitative differences
between QED and QCD. In this paper, we discuss the similarities that may
survive in a non-perturbative QCD calculation in the context of a precision
non-perturbative QED calculation. Central to the discussion are how a
constituent picture arises in a gauge field theory, how bound-state energy
scales emerge to guide the renormalization procedure, and how rotational
invariance emerges in a light-front calculation.
