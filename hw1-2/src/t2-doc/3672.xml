String Field Theory of Noncritical Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the Hamiltonian operator of the string field theory for $c=0$
string theory. It describes how strings evolve in the coordinate frame, which
is defined by using the geodesic distance on the worldsheet. The Hamiltonian
consists of three-string interaction terms and a tadpole term. We show that one
can derive the loop amplitudes of $c=0$ string theory from this Hamiltonian.
