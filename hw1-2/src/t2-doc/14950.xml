Duality Symmetry in the Schwarz-Sen Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The continuous extension of the discrete duality symmetry of the Schwarz-Sen
model is studied. The corresponding infinitesimal generator $Q$ turns out to be
local, gauge invariant and metric independent. Furthermore, $Q$ commutes with
all the conformal group generators. We also show that $Q$ is equivalent to the
non---local duality transformation generator found in the Hamiltonian
formulation of Maxwell theory. We next consider the Batalin--Fradkin-Vilkovisky
formalism for the Maxwell theory and demonstrate that requiring a local duality
transformation lead us to the Schwarz--Sen formulation. The partition functions
are shown to be the same which implies the quantum equivalence of the two
approaches.
