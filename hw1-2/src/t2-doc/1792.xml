Skyrmion-Skyrmion Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the scattering of Skyrmions at low energy and large separation using
the method proposed by Manton of truncation to a finite number of degree
freedom. We calculate the induced metric on the manifold of the union of
gradient flow curves, which for large separation, to first non-trivial order is
parametrised by the variables of the product ansatz.
