The Master Ward Identity
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of perturbative quantum field theory (QFT) we propose a new,
universal (re)normalization condition (called 'master Ward identity') which
expresses the symmetries of the underlying classical theory. It implies for
example the field equations, energy-momentum, charge- and ghost-number
conservation, renormalized equal-time commutation relations and BRST-symmetry.
  It seems that the master Ward identity can nearly always be satisfied, the
only exceptions we know are the usual anomalies. We prove the compatibility of
the master Ward identity with the other (re)normalization conditions of causal
perturbation theory, and for pure massive theories we show that the 'central
solution' of Epstein and Glaser fulfills the master Ward identity, if the
UV-scaling behavior of its individual terms is not relatively lowered.
  Application of the master Ward identity to the BRST-current of non-Abelian
gauge theories generates an identity (called 'master BRST-identity') which
contains the information which is needed for a local construction of the
algebra of observables, i.e. the elimination of the unphysical fields and the
construction of physical states in the presence of an adiabatically switched
off interaction.
