Summation and renormalization of bubble graphs to all orders
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce the 2PPI expansion which sums the bubble graphs to all orders.
We show that this expansion can be renormalised with the usual counterterms in
a mass independent scheme. We discuss its application to the O(N) linear sigma
model.
