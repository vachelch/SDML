Perturbation theory including topological degrees of freedom: Yang-Mills
  theory in three Euclidean dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A method for systematically including topological degrees of freedom in
perturbation theory is developed. This is not bound by the restrictions of
semi-classical techniques. The Yang-Mills theory in three Euclidean dimensions
is considered here. A well-defined separation of the topological and the ``spin
wave'' degrees of freedom is obtained, motivated by a singular gauge. This has
``photons'' distorting the spherically symmetric magnetic fields of Dirac
monopoles, and massless charged vector bosons ``W'' scattering off the latter.
It is explicitly shown that the Dirac string does not contribute. The mode of
the charged vector bosons with total angular momentum J=0 provides precisely
the core to give a finite energy to the monopole. The radial equation for W is
remarkably simplified and only two polarization states survive exactly for the
anomalous magnetic moment required by the Yang-Mills interaction.
