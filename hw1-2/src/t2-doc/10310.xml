Axial Anomaly from the BPHZ regularized BV master equation
</title>

<abstract>
  A BPHZ renormalized form for the master equation of the field antifiled (or
BV) quantization has recently been proposed by De Jonghe, Paris and Troost.
This framework was shown to be very powerful in calculating gauge anomalies. We
show here that this equation can also be applied in order to calculate a global
anomaly (anomalous divergence of a classically conserved Noether current),
considering the case of QED. This way, the fundamental result about the
anomalous contribution to the Axial Ward identity in standard QED (where there
is no gauge anomaly) is reproduced in this BPHZ regularized BV framework.
