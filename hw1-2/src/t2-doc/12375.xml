Strong Coupling Hadron Masses in $1/d$ Expansion for Wilson fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the weak-strong coupling expansion \cite{Rosenstein}, we
calculate the spectrum of hadrons using a systematic $1/d$ ($d$ -
dimensionality of spacetime) in addition to a strong coupling expansion in
$\beta$. The $1/d$ expansion is pushed to the next to leading order in ($1/d$)
for mesons and next to next to leading order for baryons. We do the calculation
using Wilson fermions with arbitrary $r$ and show that doublers decouple from
the spectrum only when $r$ is close to the Wilson's value $r=1$. For these $r$
the spectrum is much closer to the lattice results and the phenomenological
values than those obtained by using either the (nonsystematic) "randomwalk"
approximation or the hopping parameter expansion. In particular, the value of
the nucleon to $\rho$ - meson mass ratio is lowered to $\frac {3 \log d -1/4}{2
{\rm arccosh} 2}+O(1/d)\approx 1.48$. The result holds even for $\beta$ as
large as 5, where the weak-strong coupling expansion is applicable and
therefore these results are expected to be reasonable.
