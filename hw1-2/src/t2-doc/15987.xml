Double Scaling Limit of the Supervirasoro Constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper supersedes the preprint Superloop Equations in the Double Scaling
Limit, CERN-TH-6575. It is an improved version with corrections in the
derivation of the continuum limit, a clarification of the doubling of degrees
of freedom for even potentials, and with a heuristic argument showing that the
part of the free energy independent of fermion couplings in our model satisfies
the KdV Hierarchy.
