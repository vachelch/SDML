On the Quantization of the Gravitational Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new point of view on the quantization of the gravitational
field, namely we use exclusively the quantum framework of the second
quantization. More explicitly, we take as one-particle Hilbert space,
$H_{graviton}$ the unitary irreducible representation of the Poincar\'e group
corresponding to a massless particle of helicity 2 and apply the second
quantization procedure with Einstein-Bose statistics. The resulting Hilbert
space ${\cal F}^{+}(H_{graviton})$ is, by definition, the Hilbert space of the
gravitational field. Then we prove that this Hilbert space is canonically
isomorphic to a space of the type $Ker(Q)/Im(Q)$ where $Q$ is a supercharge
defined in an extension of the Hilbert space ${\cal F}^{+} (H}_{graviton})$ by
the inclusion of ghosts: some Fermion ghosts $u_{\mu}, \tilde{u}_{\mu}$ which
are vector fields and a Bosonic ghost $\Phi$ which is a scalar field. This has
to be contrasted to the usual approaches where only the Fermion ghosts are
considered. However, a rigorous proof that this is, indeed, possible seems to
be lacking from the literature.
