The Spectrum of Softly Broken N=1 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the spectrum of the softly broken generalized Veneziano-Yankielowicz
effective action for N=1 SUSY Yang-Mills theory. Two dual formulations of the
effective action are given. The spurion method is used for the soft SUSY
breaking. Masses of the bound states are calculated and mixing patterns are
discussed. Mass splittings of pure gluonic states are consistent with
predictions of conventional Yang-Mills theory. The results can be tested in
lattice simulations of the SUSY Yang-Mills model.
