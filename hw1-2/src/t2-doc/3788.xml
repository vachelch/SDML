A Two-loop Test of Buscher's T-duality I
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the two loop quantum equivalence of sigma models related by
Buscher's T-duality transformation. The computation of the two loop
perturbative free energy density is performed in the case of a certain
deformation of the SU(2) principal sigma model, and its T-dual, using
dimensional regularization and the geometric sigma model perturbation theory.
We obtain agreement between the free energy density expressions of the two
models.
