$Q\bar Q$ potential from AdS-CFT relation at $T\geq 0$: Dependence on
  orientation in internal space and higher curvature corrections
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the classical approximation we calculate the static $Q\bar Q$
potential via the AdS/CFT relation for nonzero temperature and arbitrary
internal orientation of the quarks. We use a higher order curvature corrected
target space background. For timelike Wilson loops there arises a critical
line in the orientation-distance plane which is shifted to larger distances
relative to the calculation with uncorrected background. Beyond that line there
is no $Q\bar Q$-force. The overall vanishing of the force for antipodal
orientation known from zero tempera ture remains valid. The spacelike Wilson
loops yield a string tension for a (2+1)-dimensional gauge theory, independent
of the relative internal orientation, but sensitive to the background
correction.
