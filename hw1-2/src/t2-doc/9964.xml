Monopoles, vortices and kinks in the framework of non-commutative
  geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  Non-commutative differential geometry allows a scalar field to be regarded as
a gauge connection, albeit on a discrete space. We explain how the underlying
gauge principle corresponds to the independence of physics on the choice of
vacuum state, should it be non-unique. A consequence is that Yang-Mills-Higgs
theory can be reformulated as a generalised Yang-Mills gauge theory on
Euclidean space with a $Z_2$ internal structure. By extending the Hodge star
operation to this non-commutative space, we are able to define the notion of
self-duality of the gauge curvature form in arbitrary dimensions. It turns out
that BPS monopoles, critically coupled vortices, and kinks are all self-dual
solutions in their respective dimensions. We then prove, within this unified
formalism, that static soliton solutions to the Yang-Mills-Higgs system exist
only in one, two and three spatial dimensions.
