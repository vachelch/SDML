The Sub-leading Magnetic Deformation of the Tricritical Ising Model in
  2D as RSOS Restriction of the Izergin-Korepin Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the $S$-matrix of the Tricritical Ising Model perturbed by the
subleading magnetic operator using Smirnov's RSOS reduction of the
Izergin-Korepin model. We discuss some features of the scattering theory we
obtain, in particular a non trivial implementation of crossing-symmetry,
interesting connections between the asymptotic behaviour of the amplitudes, the
possibility of introducing generalized statistics, and the monodromy properties
of the OPE of the unperturbed Conformal Field Theory.
