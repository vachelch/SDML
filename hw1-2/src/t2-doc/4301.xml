Graphical Representation of Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  A graphical representation of supersymmetry is presented. It clearly
expresses the chiral flow appearing in SUSY quantities, by representing spinors
by {\it directed lines} (arrows). The chiral indices are expressed by the
directions (up, down, left, right) of the arrows. The SL(2,C) invariants are
represented by {\it wedges}. Both the Weyl spinor and the Majorana spinor are
treated. We are free from the messy symbols of spinor indices. The method is
applied to the 5D supersymmetry. Many applications are expected. The result is
suitable for coding a computer program and is highly expected to be applicable
to various SUSY theories (including Supergravity) in various dimensions.
