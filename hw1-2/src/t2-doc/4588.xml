Graded Lagrangians, exotic topological D-branes and enhanced
  triangulated categories
</title>

<abstract>
  I point out that (BPS saturated) A-type D-branes in superstring
compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds correspond to {\em graded} special
Lagrangian submanifolds, a particular case of the graded Lagrangian
submanifolds considered by M. Kontsevich and P. Seidel. Combining this with the
categorical formulation of cubic string field theory in the presence of
D-branes, I consider a collection of {\em topological} D-branes wrapped over
the same Lagrangian cycle and {\em derive} its string field action from first
principles. The result is a {\em $\Z$-graded} version of super-Chern-Simons
field theory living on the Lagrangian cycle, whose relevant string field is a
degree one superconnection in a $\Z$-graded superbundle, in the sense
previously considered in mathematical work of J. M. Bismutt and J. Lott. This
gives a refined (and modified) version of a proposal previously made by C.
Vafa. I analyze the vacuum deformations of this theory and relate them to
topological D-brane composite formation, by using the general formalism
developed in a previous paper. This allows me to identify a large class of
topological D-brane composites (generalized, or `exotic' topological D-branes)
which do not admit a traditional description. Among these are objects which
correspond to the `covariantly constant sequences of flat bundles' considered
by Bismut and Lott, as well as more general structures, which are related to
the enhanced triangulated categories of Bondal and Kapranov. I also give a
rough sketch of the relation between this construction and the large radius
limit of a certain version of the `derived category of Fukaya's category'.
