Universal exponential solution of the Yang-Baxter equation
</title>

<abstract>
  Exponential solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation give rise to generalized
Schubert polynomials and corresponding symmetric functions. We provide several
descriptions of the local stationary algebra defined by this equation. This
allows to construct various exponential solutions of the YBE. The $B_n$ and
$G_2$ cases are also treated.
