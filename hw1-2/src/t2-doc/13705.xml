Lie Algebras and Braided Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that every Lie algebra or superLie algebra has a canonical braiding
on it, and that in terms of this its enveloping algebra appears as a flat space
with braided-commuting coordinate functions. This also gives a new point of
view about $q$-Minkowski space which arises in a similar way as the enveloping
algebra of the braided Lie algebra $gl_{2,q}$. Our point of view fixes the
signature of the metric on $q$-Minkowski space and hence also of ordinary
Minkowski space at $q=1$. We also describe an abstract construction for
left-invariant integration on any braided group.
