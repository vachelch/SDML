Prepotentials in N=2 SU(2) Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory with
  Massless Hypermultiplets
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the prepotential of the low-energy effective action for $N=2$
$SU(2)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with $N_f$ massless hypermultiplets
($N_f=1,\, 2,\, 3$). The precise evaluation of the instanton corrections is
performed by making use of the Picard-Fuchs equations associated with elliptic
curves. The flavor dependence of the instanton effect is determined explicitly
both in the weak- and strong-coupling regimes.
