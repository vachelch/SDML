The Image of Self Intersecting QCD Strings in Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We numerically examine the self-dual solutions of self-intersecting strings
immersed in four dimensions. We find that open torus knots have topologies that
can support monopole/anti-monopole as well as q-qbar production and
annihilation. We give an estimate of the string tension from quark production
rates, show that the intersection number for torus-knots is 4(p-q), and discuss
a chiral symmetry breaking mechanism due to self-intersections. We supply a
MAPLE program that can annimate the torus-knot solutions. These annimations can
be found at http://www-hep.physics.uiowa.edu/~bacus/research.html under the
``Animation Control Panel''.
