Integration of the SL(2,R)/U(1) Gauged WZNW Theory by Reduction and
  Quantum Parafermions
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a gauge invariant reduction we directly integrate the SL(2,R)/U(1) WZNW
theory. We prove that the conserved parafermions of this theory are coset
currents. Quantum mechanically, the parafermion algebra, the energy-momentum
tensor, and `auxiliary' parafermions are deformed in a self-consistent manner.
