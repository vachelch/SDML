Creation of Fundamental Strings by Crossing D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the force balance between orthogonally positioned $p$-brane and
$(8-p)$-brane. The force due to graviton and dilaton exchange is repulsive in
this case. We identify the attractive force that balances this repulsion as due
to one-half of a fundamental string stretched between the branes. As the
$p$-brane passes through the $(8-p)$-brane, the connecting string changes
direction, which may be interpreted as creation of one fundamental string. We
show this directly from the structure of the Chern-Simons terms in the D-brane
effective actions. We also discuss the effect of string creation on the 0-brane
quantum mechanics in the type I' theory. The creation of a fundamental string
is related by U-duality to the creation of a 3-brane discussed by Hanany and
Witten. Both processes have a common origin in M-theory: as two M5-branes with
one common direction cross, a M2-brane stretched between them is created.
