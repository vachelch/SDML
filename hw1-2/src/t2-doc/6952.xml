The One Dimensional Matrix Model and String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the basic features of the double scaling limit of the one
dimensional matrix model and its interpretation as a two dimensional string
theory. Using the collective field theory formulation of the model we show how
the fluctuations of the collective field can be interpreted as the massless
"tachyon" of the two dimensional string in a linear dilaton background. We
outline the basic physical properties of the theory and discuss the nature of
the S-matrix. Finally we show that the theory admits of another interpretation
in which a certain integral transform of the collective field behaves as the
massless "tachyon" in the two dimensional string with a blackhole background.
We show that both the classical background and the fluctuations are
non-singular at the black hole singularity.
