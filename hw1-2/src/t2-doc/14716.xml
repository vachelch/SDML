On the Masses of the Leptons, Bosons and Quarks
</title>

<abstract>
  A previously developed lepton mass equation is extended to include the
massive bosons and quarks of all three generations. The particles are modeled
as closed, string-like, light front solitons whose key quantum numbers are
their node number n and their winding number omega. The simplicity and form of
the mass equation suggests that the dominant mass effect comes from how the
particles embed themselves in spacetime.
