Matching Conditions and Duality in N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories in the
  Conformal Window
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss duality in $N=1$ SUSY gauge theories in Seiberg's conformal
window, $(3N_c/2)<N_f<3N_c$. The 't Hooft consistency conditions -- the basic
tool for establishing the infrared duality -- are considered taking into
account higher order $\alpha$ corrections. The conserved (anomaly free) $R$
current is built to all orders in $\alpha$. Although this current contains all
orders in $\alpha$ the 't Hooft consistency conditions for this current are
shown to be one-loop. This observation thus justifies Seiberg's matching
procedure. We also briefly discuss the inequivalence of the ``electric" and
``magnetic" theories at short distances.
