Equivariant Kaehler Geometry and Localization in the G/G Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze in detail the equivariant supersymmetry of the $G/G$ model. In
spite of the fact that this supersymmetry does not model the infinitesimal
action of the group of gauge transformations, localization can be established
by standard arguments. The theory localizes onto reducible connections and a
careful evaluation of the fixed point contributions leads to an alternative
derivation of the Verlinde formula for the $G_{k}$ WZW model. We show that the
supersymmetry of the $G/G$ model can be regarded as an infinite dimensional
realization of Bismut's theory of equivariant Bott-Chern currents on K\"ahler
manifolds, thus providing a convenient cohomological setting for understanding
the Verlinde formula. We also show that the supersymmetry is related to a
non-linear generalization (q-deformation) of the ordinary moment map of
symplectic geometry in which a representation of the Lie algebra of a group $G$
is replaced by a representation of its group algebra with commutator $[g,h] =
gh-hg$. In the large $k$ limit it reduces to the ordinary moment map of
two-dimensional gauge theories.
