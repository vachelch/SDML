On the fermion-boson correspondence for correlation functions of
  disorder operators
</title>

<abstract>
  When a quantum field theory possesses topological excitations in a phase with
spontaneously broken symmetry, these are created by operators which are
non-local with respect to the order parameter. Due to non-locality, such
disorder operators have non-trivial correlation functions even in free massive
theories. In two dimensions, these correlators can be expressed exactly in
terms of solutions of non-linear differential equations. The correlation
functions of the one-parameter family of non-local operators in the free
charged bosonic and fermionic models are the inverse of each other. We point
out a simple derivation of this correspondence within the form factor approach
