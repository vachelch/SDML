Black Hole Remnants and the Information Puzzle
</title>

<abstract>
  Magnetically charged dilatonic black holes have a perturbatively infinite
ground state degeneracy associated with an infinite volume throat region of the
geometry. A simple argument based on causality is given that these states do
not have a description as ordinary massive particles in a low-energy effective
field theory. Pair production of magnetic black holes in a weak magnetic field
is estimated in a weakly-coupled semiclassical expansion about an instanton and
found to be finite, despite the infinite degeneracy of states. This suggests
that these states may store the information apparently lost in black hole
scattering processes.
