The spectrum of boundary states in sine-Gordon model with integrable
  boundary conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  The bound state spectrum and the associated reflection factors are determined
for the sine-Gordon model with arbitrary integrable boundary condition by
closing the bootstrap. Comparing the symmetries of the bound state spectrum
with that of the Lagrangian it is shown how one can "derive" the relationship
between the UV and IR parameters conjectured earlier.
