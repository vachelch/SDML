Free Boson Realization of $U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a realization of the quantum affine algebra
$U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$ of an arbitrary level $k$ in terms of free boson fields.
In the $q\!\rightarrow\! 1$ limit this realization becomes the Wakimoto
realization of $\widehat{sl_N}$. The screening currents and the vertex
operators(primary fields) are also constructed; the former commutes with
$U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$ modulo total difference, and the latter creates the
$U_q(\widehat{sl_N})$ highest weight state from the vacuum state of the boson
Fock space.
