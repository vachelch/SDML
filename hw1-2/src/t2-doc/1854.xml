Black Holes and U-Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the general charged rotating black hole solutions of the maximal
supergravities in dimensions $4\le D\le 9$ arising from toroidally compactified
Type II string or M-theories. In each dimension, these are obtained by acting
on a generating solution with classical duality symmetries. In D=4, D=5 and
$6\le D \le 9$ the generating solution is specified by the ADM mass,
$[{D-1}/2]$-angular momentum components and five, three and two charges,
respectively. We discuss the BPS-saturated (static) black holes and derive the
U-duality invariant form of the area of the horizon. We also comment on the
U-duality invariant form of the BPS mass formulae.
