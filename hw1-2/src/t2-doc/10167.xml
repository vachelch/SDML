Hamiltonian Analysis of SL(2,R) Symmetry in Liouville Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a Hamiltonian analysis of the Liouville theory and construction
of symmetry generators using Castellani's method. We then discuss the
light-cone gauge fixed theory. In particular, we clarify the difference between
Hamiltonian approaches based on different choices of time, $\xi^0$ and $\xi^+$.
Our main result is the construction of SL(2,R) symmetry generators in both
cases. ( Lectures presented at the Danube Workshop '93,
  June 1993, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.)
