  A recently derived basic theorem on the decomposition of SO(2N) vertices is
used to obtain a complete analytic determination of all SO(10) invariant cubic
superpotential couplings involving $16_{\pm}$ semispinors of SO(10) chirality
$\pm$ and tensor representations. In addition to the superpotential couplings
computed previously using the basic theorem involving the 10, 120 and
$\bar{126}$ tensor representations we compute here couplings involving the 1,
45 and 210 dimensional tensor representations, i.e., we compute the
$\bar{16}_{\mp}16_{\pm}1$,$\bar{16}_{\mp}16_{\pm}45$ and
$\bar{16}_{\mp}16_{\pm}210$ Higgs couplings in the superpotential. A complete
determination of dimension five operators in the superpotential arising from
the mediation of the 1, 45 and 210 dimensional representations is also given.
The vector couplings $\bar{16}_{\pm}16_{\pm}1$, $\bar{16}_{\pm}16_{\pm}45$ and
$\bar{16}_{\pm}16_{\pm}210$ are also analyzed. The role of large tensor
representations and the possible application of results derived here in model
building are discussed.
