Renormalization Group Approach to Interacting Crumpled Surfaces: The
  hierarchical recursion
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the scaling limit of a model of a tethered crumpled D-dimensional
random surface interacting through an exclusion condition with a fixed impurity
in d-dimensional Euclidean space by the methods of Wilson's renormalization
group. In this paper we consider a hierarchical version of the model and we
prove rigorously the existence of the scaling limit and convergence to a
non-Gaussian fixed point for $1 \leq D< 2$ and $\epsilon >0$ sufficiently
small, where $\epsilon = D - (2-D) {d\over 2}$.
