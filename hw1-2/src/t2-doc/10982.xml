Quantum deformations for the diagonal R-matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider two different types of deformations for the linear group $ GL(n)$
which correspond to using of a general diagonal R-matrix. Relations between
braided and quantum deformed algebras and their coactions on a quantum plane
are discussed. We show that tensor-grading-preserving differential calculi can
be constructed on braided groups , quantum groups and quantum planes for the
case of the diagonal R-matrix.
