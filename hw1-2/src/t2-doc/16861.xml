The Seiberg-Witten Differential From M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The form of the Seiberg-Witten differential is derived from the M-theory
approach to N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories by directly imposing the BPS
condition for twobranes ending on fivebranes. The BPS condition also implies
that the pullback of the Kahler form onto the space part of the twobrane
world-volume vanishes.
