Exact Superpotentials, Quantum Vacua and Duality in Supersymmetric
  SP(N_c) Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study $N=1$ supersymmetric $SP(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ flavors of
quarks in the fundamental representation. Depending on $N_f$ and $N_c$, we find
exact, dynamically generated superpotentials, smooth quantum moduli spaces of
vacua, quantum moduli spaces of vacua with additional massless composites at
strong coupling, confinement without chiral symmetry breaking, non-trivial
fixed points of the renormalization group, and massless magnetic quarks and
gluons.
