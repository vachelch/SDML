Parafermionic Reductions of WZW Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate a class of conformal Non-Abelian-Toda models representing a
noncompact $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ parafermionions (PF) interacting with a specific
abelian Toda theories and having a global U(1) symmetry. A systematic
derivation of the conserved currents, their algebras and the exact solution of
these models is presented. An important property of this class of models is the
affine $SL(2,R)_q$ algebra spanned by charges of the chiral and antichiral
nonlocal currents and the U(1) charge. The classical (Poisson Brackets)
algebras of symmetries $V{G_n}$ of these models appears to be of mixed
PF-$W{G_n}$ type. They contain together with the local quadratic terms specific
for the $W_n$-algebras the nonlocal terms similar to the ones of the classical
PF-algebra. The renormalization of the spins of the nonlocal currents is the
main new feature of the quantum $V{A_n}$-algebras. The quantum $V{A_2}$-algebra
and its degenerate representations are studied in detail.
