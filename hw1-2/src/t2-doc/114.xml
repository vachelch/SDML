Comparison of relativity theories with observer-independent scales of
  both velocity and length/mass
</title>

<abstract>
  There are now in the literature two proposals of relativity theories with
observer-independent scales of both velocity and length/mass: one, which we
here call "DSR1", proposed by Amelino-Camelia in gr-qc/0012051,hep-th/0012238
and one, which we here call "DSR2", proposed by Magueijo and Smolin in
hep-th/0112090. We argue that a key aspect of such theories are the kinematical
conditions for particle production in collision processes. We derive these
kinematical conditions for DSR2, which was originally formulated only in the
one-particle sector. This result is then used to characterize the differences
between the two proposals; in particular, we find that, while experiments such
as AMS and GLAST can test some of the predictions of DSR1, the effects
predicted by DSR2 are much weaker and none of them should be testable in the
foreseeable future. We also show that if one interprets, as done in
hep-th/0112090, the DSR2-boost parameter $v$ as the relative velocity between
the observers connected by the boost one is then forced to give up the
"Hamiltonian" relation $v_{particle} =dE/dp$ between the speed of a particle
and its momentum. We argue that, adopting an accordingly modified
interpretation of the DSR2-boost parameter $v$, one can maintain the relation
$v_{particle} =dE/dp$ in DSR2.
