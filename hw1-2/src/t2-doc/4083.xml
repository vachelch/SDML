On Chiral p-Forms
</title>

<abstract>
  Some aspects of chiral p-forms, in particular the obstruction that makes it
hard to define covariant Green functions, are discussed. It is shown that a
proposed resolution involving an infinite set of gauge fields can be made
mathematically rigourous in the classical case. We also give a brief
demonstration of species doubling for chiral bosons.
