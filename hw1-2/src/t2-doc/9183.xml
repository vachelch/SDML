Charged Stringy Black Holes With Non-Abelian Hair
</title>

<abstract>
  Static spherically symmetric asymptotically flat charged black hole solutions
are constructed within the magnetic SU(3) sector of the 4-dimensional heterotic
string effective action. They possess non-abelian hair in addition to the
Coulomb magnetic field and are qualitatively similar to the Einstein-Yang-Mills
colored SU(3) black holes except for the extremal case. In the extremality
limit the horizon shrinks and the resulting geometry around the origin
coincides with that of an extremal abelian dilatonic black hole with magnetic
charge. Non-abelian hair exibits then typical sphaleron structure.
