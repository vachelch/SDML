Baxterization, dynamical systems, and the symmetries of integrability
</title>

<abstract>
  We resolve the `baxterization' problem with the help of the automorphism
group of the Yang-Baxter (resp. star-triangle, tetrahedron, \dots) equations.
This infinite group of symmetries is realized as a non-linear (birational)
Coxeter group acting on matrices, and exists as such, {\em beyond the narrow
context of strict integrability}. It yields among other things an unexpected
elliptic parametrization of the non-integrable sixteen-vertex model. It
provides us with a class of discrete dynamical systems, and we address some
related problems, such as characterizing the complexity of iterations.
