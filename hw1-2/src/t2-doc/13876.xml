"Double-trace" Deformations, Boundary Conditions and Spacetime
  Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  Double-trace deformations of the AdS/CFT duality result in a new perturbation
expansion for string theory, based on a non-local worldsheet. We discuss some
aspects of the deformation in the low energy gravity approximation, where it
appears as a change in the boundary condition of fields. We relate unique
features of the boundary of AdS to the worldsheet becoming non-local, and
conjecture that non-local worldsheet actions may be generic in other classes of
backgrounds.
