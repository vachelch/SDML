N=1 Super Yang Mills renormalization schemes for Fractional Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate N=1 super Yang-Mills theory using fractional branes. We first
define the beta-function with respect to a supergravity coordinate. To provide
the relation between the supergravity parameter and the renormalization group
scale we use the UV known gauge theory beta-function as a type of boundary
condition. We show that there are no privileged renormalization schemes
connected to a given supergravity solution while we investigate in some detail
two schemes. The Wilsonian one where just one loop is manifest and the one
containing multi-loops. A new functional relation between the gaugino
condensate and the supergravity coordinates is finally determined.
