Pseudoclassical and quantum theory of the D=2n dimensional relativistic
  spinning particle with anomalous ``magnetic'' moment in the external
  Yang-Mills field

<abstract>
  The pseudoclassical hamiltonian and action of the $D=2n$ dimensional Dirac
particle with anomalous magnetic moment interacting with the external
Yang-Mills field are found. The Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation of motion for
the Pauli-Lubanski vector is deduced. The canonical quantization of $D=2n$
dimensional Dirac spinning particle with anomalous magnetic moment in the
external Yang-Mills field is carried out in the gauge which allows to describe
simultaneously particles and antiparticles (massive and massless) already at
the classical level. Pseudoclassical Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation is used to
obtain canonical (Newton-Wigner) coordinates and in terms of these variables
the theory is quantized.
