String Webs and 1/4 BPS Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue for the existence of many new 1/4 BPS states in N=4 SU(N_c)
Super-Yang-Mills theory with N_c>=3, by constructing them from supersymmetric
string webs whose external strings terminate on parallel D3-branes. The masses
of the string webs are shown to agree with the BPS bound for the corresponding
states in SYM. We identify the curves of marginal stability, at which these
states decay into other BPS states. We find the bosonic and fermionic zero
modes of the string webs, and thereby the degeneracy and spin content of some
of the BPS states. States of arbitrarily high spin are predicted in this
manner, all of which become massless at the conformal point. For N_c>=4 we find
BPS states which transform in long multiplets, and are therefore not protected
against becoming stable non-BPS states as moduli are varied. The mass of these
extremal non-BPS states is constrained as they are connected to BPS states.
Analogous geometric phenomena are anticipated.
