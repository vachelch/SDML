Anomalies in Ward Identities for Three-Point Functions Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  A general calculational method is applied to investigate symmetry relations
among divergent amplitudes in a free fermion model. A very traditional work on
this subject is revisited. A systematic study of one, two and three point
functions associated to scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector densities
is performed. The divergent content of the amplitudes are left in terms of five
basic objects (external momentum independent). No specific assumptions about a
regulator is adopted in the calculations. All ambiguities and symmetry
violating terms are shown to be associated with only three combinations of the
basic divergent objects. Our final results can be mapped in the corresponding
Dimensional Regularization calculations (in cases where this technique could be
applied) or in those of Gertsein and Jackiw which we will show in detail. The
results emerging from our general approach allow us to extract, in a natural
way, a set of reasonable conditions (e.g. crucial for QED consistency) that
could lead us to obtain all Ward Identities satisfied. Consequently, we
conclude that the traditional approach used to justify the famous triangular
anomalies in perturbative calculations could be questionable. An alternative
point of view, dismissed of ambiguities, which lead to a correct description of
the associated phenomenology, is pointed out.
