Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations on Riemann surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations for twisted conformal blocks on
compact Riemann surfaces with marked points are written explicitly in a general
projective structure in terms of correlation functions in the theory of twisted
b-c systems. It is checked that on the moduli space the equations provide a
flat connection with the spectral parameter.
