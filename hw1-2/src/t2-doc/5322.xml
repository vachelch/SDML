Asymptotic Factorisation of the Ground-State for SU(N)-invariant
  Supersymmetric Matrix-Models

<abstract>
  We give a simple - straightforward and rigorous - derivation that when the
eigenvalues of one of the $d=9 (5,3,2)$ matrices in the SU(N) invariant
supersymmetric matrix model become large (and well separated from each other)
the ground-state wavefunction (resp. asymptotic zero-energy solution of the
corresponding differential equation) factorizes, for all $N>1$, into a product
of supersymmetric harmonic oscillator wavefunctions (involving the
`off-diagonal' degrees of freedom) and a wavefunction $\psi$ that is
annihilated by the free supercharge formed out of all `diagonal' (Cartan
sub-algebra) degrees of freedom.
