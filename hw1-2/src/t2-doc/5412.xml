Duality of boundary value problems and braneworld action in curved brane
  models
</title>

<abstract>
  Braneworld effective action is constructed by two different methods based
respectively on the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems. The
equivalence of these methods is shown due to nontrivial duality relations
between special boundary operators of these two problems. Previously known
braneworld action algorithms in two-brane Randall-Sundrum model are generalized
to curved branes with deSitter and Anti-deSitter geometries.
