Two-dimensional QCD, instanton contributions and the perturbative
  Wu-Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription

<abstract>
  The exact Wilson loop expression for the pure Yang-Mills U(N) theory on a
sphere $S^2$ of radius $R$ exhibits, in the decompactification limit $R\to
\infty$, the expected pure area exponentiation. This behaviour can be
understood as due to the sum over all instanton sectors. If only the zero
instanton sector is considered, in the decompactification limit one exactly
recovers the sum of the perturbative series in which the light-cone gauge
Yang-Mills propagator is prescribed according to Wu-Mandelstam-Leibbrandt. When
instantons are disregarded, no pure area exponentiation occurs, the string
tension is different and, in the large-N limit, confinement is lost.
