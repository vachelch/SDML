Gravitation as deduced from submicroscopic quantum mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the model of a "soft" cellular space and deterministic quantum
mechanics developed previously, the scattering of a free moving particle by
structural units of the space -- superparticles -- is studied herein. The
process of energy and inert mass transmission from the moving particle to
superparticles and hence the creation of elementary excitations of the space --
inertons -- are analyzed in detail. The space crystallite made up around the
particle in the degenerate space is shown to play the key role in those
processes. A comprehensive analysis of the nature of the origin of gravitation,
the particle's gravitational potential 1/r, and the gravitational interaction
between material objects is performed. It seems reasonably to say that the main
idea of the work may briefly be stated in the words: No motion, no gravity.
