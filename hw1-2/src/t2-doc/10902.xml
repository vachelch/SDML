On Finite-Volume Gauge Theory Partition Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove a Mahoux-Mehta--type theorem for finite-volume partition functions
of SU(N_c\geq 3) gauge theories coupled to fermions in the fundamental
representation. The large-volume limit is taken with the constraint V <<
1/m_{\pi}^4. The theorem allows one to express any k-point correlation function
of the microscopic Dirac operator spectrum entirely in terms of the 2-point
function. The sum over topological charges of the gauge fields can be
explicitly performed for these k-point correlation functions. A connection to
an integrable KP hierarchy, for which the finite-volume partition function is a
$\tau$-function, is pointed out. Relations between the effective partition
functions for these theories in 3 and 4 dimensions are derived. We also compute
analytically, and entirely from finite-volume partition functions, the
microscopic spectral density of the Dirac operator in SU(N_c) gauge theories
coupled to quenched fermions in the adjoint representation. The result
coincides exactly with earlier results based on Random Matrix Theory.
