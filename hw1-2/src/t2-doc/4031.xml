Matrix Models on Large Graphs
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the spherical limit of multi-matrix models on regular target
graphs, for instance single or multiple Potts models, or lattices of arbitrary
dimension. We show, to all orders in the low temperature expansion, that when
the degree of the target graph $\Delta\to\infty$, the free energy becomes
independent of the target graph, up to simple transformations of the matter
coupling constant. Furthermore, this universal free energy contains
contributions only from those surfaces which are made up of ``baby universes''
glued together into trees, all non-universal and non-tree contributions being
suppressed by inverse powers of $\Delta$. Each order of the free energy is put
into a simple, algebraic form.
