A local (perturbative) construction of observables in gauge theories:
  the example of QED

  Interacting fields can be constructed as formal power series in the framework
of causal perturbation theory. The local field algebra $\tilde {\cal F}({\cal
O})$ is obtained without performing the adiabatic limit; the (usually bad)
infrared behavior plays no role. To construct the observables in gauge theories
we use the Kugo-Ojima formalism; we define the BRST-transformation $\tilde s$
as a graded derivation on the algebra of interacting fields and use the
implementation of $\tilde s$ by the Kugo-Ojima operator $Q_{\rm int}$. Since
our treatment is local, the operator $Q_{\rm int}$ differs from the
corresponding operator $Q$ of the free theory. We prove that the Hilbert space
structure present in the free case is stable under perturbations. All
assumptions are shown to be satisfied in QED.
