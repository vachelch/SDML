Let's Twist Again: General Metrics of G(2) Holonomy from Gauged
  Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct all complete metrics of cohomogeneity one G(2) holonomy with S^3
x S^3 principal orbits from gauged supergravity. Our approach rests on a
generalization of the twisting procedure used in this framework. It corresponds
to a non-trivial embedding of the special Lagrangian three-cycle wrapped by the
D6-branes in the lower dimensional supergravity. There are constraints that
neatly reduce the general ansatz to a six functions one. Within this approach,
the Hitchin system and the flop transformation are nicely realized in eight
dimensional gauged supergravity.
