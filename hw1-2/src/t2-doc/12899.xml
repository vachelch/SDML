On Mass-Deformed N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the n-instanton action for the above model with gauge group
SU(2), as a function of the collective coordinates of the general self-dual
configurations of Atiyah, Drinfeld, Hitchin and Manin (ADHM). We calculate the
quantum modulus u = <Tr(A^2)> at the 1-instanton level, and find a discrepancy
with Seiberg and Witten's proposed exact solution. As in related models (N=2,
N_F=3 or 4), this discrepancy may be resolved by modifying their proposed
relation between $\tilde u$ (the parameter in the elliptic curve) and u.
