Chern-Simons action in noncommutative space
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the noncommutative Chern-Simons action induced by Dirac fermions
coupled to a background gauge field, for the fundamental, antifundamental, and
the adjoint representation. We discuss properties of the noncommutative
Chern-Simons action showing in particular that the Seiberg-Witten formula maps
it into the standard commutative Chern-Simons action.
