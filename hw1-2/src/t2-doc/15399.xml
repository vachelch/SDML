Gravitational Anomaly Cancellation for M-Theory Fivebranes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study gravitational anomalies for fivebranes in M theory. We show that an
apparent anomaly in diffeomorphisms acting on the normal bundle is cancelled by
a careful treatment of the M theory Chern-Simons coupling in the presence of
fivebranes. One interesting aspect of our treatment is the way in which a
magnetic object (the fivebrane) is smoothed out through coupling to gravity and
the resulting relation between antisymmetric tensor gauge transformations and
diffeomorphisms in the presence of a fivebrane.
