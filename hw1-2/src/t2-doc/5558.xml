Properties of Semi-Chiral Superfields
</title>

<abstract>
  Whenever the N=(2,2) supersymmetry algebra of non-linear sigma-models in two
dimensions does not close off-shell, a holomorphic two-form can be defined. The
only known superfields providing candidate auxiliary fields to achieve an
off-shell formulation are semi-chiral fields. Such a semi-chiral description is
only possible when the two-form is constant. Using an explicit example,
hyper-Kahler manifolds, we show that this is not always the case. Finally, we
give a concrete construction of semi-chiral potentials for a class of
hyper-Kahler manifolds using the duality exchanging a pair consisting of a
chiral and a twisted-chiral superfield for one semi-chiral multiplet.
