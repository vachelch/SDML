Time-dependent quantum scattering in 2+1 dimensional gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The propagation of a localized wave packet in the conical space-time created
by a pointlike massive source in 2+1 dimensional gravity is analyzed. The
scattering amplitude is determined and shown to be finite along the classical
scattering directions due to interference between the scattered and the
transmitted wave functions. The analogy with diffraction theory is emphasized.
