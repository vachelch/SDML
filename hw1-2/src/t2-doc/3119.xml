Non-BPS domain wall configurations in a supersymmetric model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the time evolution of configurations in the form of two parallel
domain walls moving towards each other in a supersymmetric field model. The
configurations involved are not BPS-saturated. It is found that for such
collisions there exists some critical value $v_{cr}\approx0.9120$ of the
initial velocity v_i of the walls. At v_i<v_{cr} we observed reflection, that
was not followed by change of vacuum states sequence. In collisions with
v_i>v_{cr} the sequence of vacuum states changes. The results of the numerical
simulations are in agreement with "potential" consideration.
