Integrability of Coupled Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The massive phase of two-layer integrable systems is studied by means of RSOS
restrictions of affine Toda theories. A general classification of all possible
integrable perturbations of coupled minimal models is pursued by an analysis of
the (extended) Dynkin diagrams. The models considered in most detail are
coupled minimal models which interpolate between magnetically coupled Ising
models and Heisenberg spin-ladders along the $c<1$ discrete series.
