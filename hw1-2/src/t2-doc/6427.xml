Cohomological analysis of gauged-fixed gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The relation between the gauge-invariant local BRST cohomology involving the
antifields and the gauge-fixed BRST cohomology is clarified. It is shown in
particular that the cocycle conditions become equivalent once it is imposed, on
the gauge-fixed side, that the BRST cocycles should yield deformations that
preserve the nilpotency of the (gauge-fixed) BRST differential. This shows that
the restrictions imposed on local counterterms by the Quantum Noether condition
in the Epstein--Glaser construction of gauge theories are equivalent to the
restrictions imposed by BRST invariance on local counterterms in the standard
Lagrangian approach.
