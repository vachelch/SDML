The Complete Cohomology of the W3 String
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a simple procedure for constructing the complete cohomology of the
BRST operator of the two-scalar and multi-scalar $W_3$ strings. The method
consists of obtaining two level--15 physical operators in the two-scalar $W_3$
string that are invertible, and that can normal order with all other physical
operators. They can be used to map all physical operators into non-trivial
physical operators whose momenta lie in a fundamental unit cell. By carrying
out an exhaustive analysis of physical operators in this cell, the entire
cohomology problem is solved.
