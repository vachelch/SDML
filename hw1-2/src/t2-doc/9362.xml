Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem for Wilson Loops Associated with General
  Gauge Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  A formula constituting the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for general semi-simple
compact gauge groups is presented. The formula involves a path integral over a
group space and is applicable to Wilson loop variables irrespective of the
topology of loops. Some simple expressions analogous to the 't Hooft tensor of
a magnetic monopole are given for the 2-form of interest. A special property in
the case of the fundamental representation of the group SU(N) is pointed out.
