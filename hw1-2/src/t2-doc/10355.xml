Three-point correlation functions in $N=1$ Super Lioville Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we propose exact three-point correlation functions for $N=1$
supersymmetric Liouville theory. Along the lines of Zamolodchikov and
Zamolodchikov paper (hep-th/9506136) we propose a generalized special function
which describe the three-point amplitudes. We consider briefly the so called
reflection amplitudes in the supersymmetric case.
