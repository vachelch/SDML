On the Embedding of Space-Time Symmetries into Simple Superalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the embedding of Spin groups of arbitrary dimension and signature
into simple superalgebras in the case of extended supersymmetry. The
R-symmetry, which generically is not compact, can be chosen compact for all the
cases that are congruent mod 8 to the physical conformal algebra so($D-2$,2),
$D\geq 3$. An $\rm{so}(1,1)$ grading of the superalgebra is found in all cases.
Central extensions of super translation algebras are studied in this framework.
