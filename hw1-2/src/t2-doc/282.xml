Strings in the near plane wave background and AdS/CFT
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the AdS/CFT correspondence for string states which flow into plane
wave states in the Penrose limit. Leading finite radius corrections to the
string spectrum are compared with scaling dimensions of finite R-charge
BMN-like operators. We find agreement between string and gauge theory results.
