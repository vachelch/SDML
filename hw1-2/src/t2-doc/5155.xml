Renormalization of the Planck mass for type II superstrings on symmetric
  orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the one-loop renormalization of the Planck mass for type II string
theories compactified to four dimensions on symmetric orbifolds that preserve
${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry. Depending on the orbifold, the effect can be as
large as to compete with the standard tree-level value.
