Fermions in spherical field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the spherical field formalism for fermions. We find that the
spherical field method is free from certain difficulties which complicate
lattice calculations, such as fermion doubling, missing axial anomalies, and
computational problems regarding internal fermion loops.
