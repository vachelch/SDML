Vortex Pair Creation on Brane-Antibrane Pair via Marginal Deformation
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been conjectured that the vortex solution on a D-brane - anti-D-brane
system represents a D-brane of two lower dimension. We establish this result by
first identifying a series of marginal deformations which create the vortex -
antivortex pair on the brane - antibrane system, and then showing that under
this series of marginal deformations the original D-brane - anti-D-brane system
becomes a D-brane - anti-D-brane system with two lower dimensions.
Generalization of this construction to the case of solitons of higher
codimension is also discussed.
