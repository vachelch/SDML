Massless fermions in a bag at finite density and temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce the chemical potential in a system of massless fermions in a bag
by impossing boundary conditions in the Euclidean time direction. We express
the fermionic mean number in terms of a functional trace involving the Green's
function of the boundary value problem, which we study analytically. Numerical
evaluations are made, and an application to a simple hadron model is discussed.
