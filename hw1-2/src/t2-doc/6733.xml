Gauge transformations in relativistic two-particle constraint theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using connection with quantum field theory, the infinitesimal covariant
abelian gauge transformation laws of relativistic two-particle constraint
theory wave functions and potentials are established and weak invariance of the
corresponding wave equations shown. Because of the three-dimensional projection
operation, these transformation laws are interaction dependent. Simplifications
occur for local potentials, which result, in each formal order of perturbation
theory, from the infra-red leading effects of multiphoton exchange diagrams. In
this case, the finite gauge transformation can explicitly be represented, with
a suitable approximation and up to a multiplicative factor, by a momentum
dependent unitary operator that acts in $x$-space as a local dilatation
operator. The latter is utilized to reconstruct from the Feynman gauge the
potentials in other linear covariant gauges. The resulting effective potential
of the final Pauli-Schr\"odinger type eigenvalue equation has the gauge
invariant attractive singularity $\alpha^2/r^2$, leading to a gauge invariant
critical coupling constant $\alpha_c =1/2$.
