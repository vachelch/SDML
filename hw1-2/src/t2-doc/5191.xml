Chirality of Knots $9_{42}$ and $10_{71}$ and Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Upto ten crossing number, there are two knots, $9_{42}$ and $10_{71}$ whose
chirality is not detected by any of the known polynomials, namely, Jones
invariants and their two variable generalisations, HOMFLY and Kauffman
invariants. We show that the generalised knot invariants, obtained through
$SU(2)$ Chern-Simons topological field theory, which give the known polynomials
as special cases, are indeed sensitive to the chirality of these knots.
