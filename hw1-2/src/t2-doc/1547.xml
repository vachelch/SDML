Various Wrapped Branes from Gauged Supergravities

<abstract>
  We study wrapped brane configurations via possible maximally supersymmetric
gauged supergravities. First, we construct various supersymmetric wrapped D3
brane configurations from D=5 N=8 SO(6) gauged supergravity. This procedure
provides certain new examples of wrapped D3 branes around supersymmetric cycles
inside non-compact special holonomy manifolds. We analyze their behaviors
numerically in order to discuss a correspondence to Higgs and Coulomb branches
of sigma models on wrapped D3 branes. We also realize supersymmetric wrapped M2
branes from D=4 N=8 SO(8) gauged supergravity. Then, we study supersymmetric
wrapped type IIB NS5 branes by D=7 N=4 SO(4) gauged supergravity. We show a
method to derive them by using supersymmetric wrapped M5 branes in D=7 N=4
SO(5) gauged supergravity. This method is based on a domain wall like
reduction. Solutions include NS5 branes wrapped around holomorphic $CP^2$
inside non-compact Calabi-Yau threefold. Their behavior shows a similar feature
to that for NS5 branes wrapped around holomorphic $CP^1$ inside non-compact
$K3$ surface. This construction also provides a check of preserved
supersymmetry for a solution interpreted within a string world-sheet theory
introduced by Hori and Kapustin. Finally, we find new non-supersymmetric
solutions including AdS space-times in D=6 N=2 $SU(2)\times U(1)$ massive
gauged supergravity. These solutions can be interpreted as non-supersymmetric
wrapped D4-D8 configurations which are dual to non-supersymmetric conformal
field theories realized on wrapped D4 branes.
