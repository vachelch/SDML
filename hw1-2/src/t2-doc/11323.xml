Algebraic connections on parallel universes

<abstract>
  For any manifold $M$, we introduce a $\ZZ $-graded differential algebra
$\Xi$, which, in particular, is a bi-module over the associative algebra
$C(M\cup M)$. We then introduce the corresponding covariant differentials and
show how this construction can be interpreted in terms of Yang-Mills and Higgs
fields. This is a particular example of noncommutative geometry. It differs
from the prescription of Connes in the following way: The definition of $\Xi$
does not rely on a given Dirac-Yukawa operator acting on a space of spinors.
