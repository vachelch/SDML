Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Phase Transitions: From the Early Universe
  to Chiral Condensates
</title>

<abstract>
  In this brief review we introduce the methods of quantum field theory out of
equilibrium and study the non-equilibrium aspects of phase transitions.
Specifically we critically study the picture of the ``slow-roll'' phase
transition in the new inflationary models, we show that the instabilities that
are the hallmark of the phase transition, that is the formation of correlated
domains, dramatically change this picture. We analyze in detail the dynamics of
phase separation in strongly supercooled phase transitions in Minkowski space.
We argue that this is typically the situation in weakly coupled scalar
theories. The effective evolution equations for the expectation value and the
fluctuations of an inflaton field in a FRW cosmology are derived both in the
loop expansion and in a self-consistent non-perturbative scheme. Finally we use
these non-equilibrium techniques and concepts to study the influence of quantum
and thermal fluctuations on the dynamics of a proposed mechanism for the
formation of disoriented chiral condensates during a rapid phase transition out
of equilibrium. This last topic may prove to be experimentally relevant at
present accelerator energies. To appear in the Proceedings of the `2nd.
