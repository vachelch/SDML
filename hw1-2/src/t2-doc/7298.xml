Gravitating (bi-)sphalerons
</title>

<abstract>
  The standard model of electroweak interactions is minimally coupled to
gravity and the response of the spherically symmetric solutions -the sphaleron
and the bisphaleron- to gravity is emphasized. For a given value of the Higgs
mass $M_H$, several branches of solutions exist which terminate into
cusp-catastrophy at some ($M_H$-depending) critical value of the parameter
$\alpha$ defined by the ratio of the vector-boson mass to the Planck mass. A
given branch either bifurcates from another one at an intermediate value of
$\alpha$ or persists in the limit $\alpha \to 0$ where it terminates into a
flat sphaleron or bisphaleron or into a Bartnik-McKinnon solution. These
bifurcation patterns are studied in some details.
