Renormalization Group Method Applied to Kinetic Equations: roles of
  initial values and time
</title>

<abstract>
  The so-called renormalization group (RG) method is applied to derive kinetic
and transport equations from the respective microscopic equations. The derived
equations include Boltzmann equation in classical mechanics, Fokker-Planck
equation, a rate equation in a quantum field theoretical model. Utilizing the
formulation of the RG method which elucidates the important role played by the
choice of the initial conditions, the general structure and the underlying
assumptions in the derivation of kinetic equations in the RG method is
clarified. It is shown that the present formulation naturally leads to the
choice for the initial value of the microscopic distribution function at
arbitrary time $t_0$ to be on the averaged distribution function to be
determined. The averaged distribution function may be thought as an integral
constant of the solution of microscopic evolution equation; the RG equation
gives the slow dynamics of the would-be initial constant, which is actually the
kinetic equation governing the averaged distribution function. It is further
shown that the averaging as given above gives rise to a coarse-graining of the
time-derivative which is expressed with the initial time $t_0$, thereby leads
to time-irreversible equations even from a time-reversible equation. It is
shown that a further reduction of Boltzmann equation to fluid dynamical
equations and the adiabatic elimination of fast variables in Fokker-Planck
equation are also performed in a unified way in the present method.
