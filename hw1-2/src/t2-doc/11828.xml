Casimir effect for a dilute dielectric ball at finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The Casimir effect at finite temperature is investigated for a dilute
dielectric ball; i.e., the relevant internal and free energies are calculated.
The starting point in this study is a rigorous general expression for the
internal energy of a system of noninteracting oscillators in terms of the sum
over the Matsubara frequencies. Summation over the angular momentum values is
accomplished in a closed form by making use of the addition theorem for the
relevant Bessel functions. For removing the divergences the renormalization
procedure is applied that has been developed in the calculation of the
corresponding Casimir energy at zero temperature. The behavior of the
thermodynamic characteristics in the low and high temperature limits is
investigated.
