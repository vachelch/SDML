Orientifolds and Slumps in G_2 and Spin(7) Metrics
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some new metrics of special holonomy, and their roles in string
theory and M-theory. First we consider Spin(7) metrics denoted by C_8, which
are complete on a complex line bundle over CP^3. The principal orbits are S^7,
described as a triaxially squashed S^3 bundle over S^4. The behaviour in the
S^3 directions is similar to that in the Atiyah-Hitchin metric, and we show how
this leads to an M-theory interpretation with orientifold D6-branes wrapped
over S^4. We then consider new G_2 metrics which we denote by C_7, which are
complete on an R^2 bundle over T^{1,1}, with principal orbits that are
S^3\times S^3. We study the C_7 metrics using numerical methods, and we find
that they have the remarkable property of admitting a U(1) Killing vector whose
length is nowhere zero or infinite. This allows one to make an everywhere
non-singular reduction of an M-theory solution to give a solution of the type
IIA theory. The solution has two non-trivial S^2 cycles, and both carry
magnetic charge with respect to the R-R vector field. We also discuss some
four-dimensional hyper-Kahler metrics described recently by Cherkis and
Kapustin, following earlier work by Kronheimer. We show that in certain cases
these metrics, whose explicit form is known only asymptotically, can be related
to metrics characterised by solutions of the su(\infty) Toda equation, which
can provide a way of studying their interior structure.
