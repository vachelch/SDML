On Discrete Symmetries in su(2) and su(3) Affine Theories and Related
  Graphs
</title>

<abstract>
  We classify the possible finite symmetries of conformal field theories with
an affine Lie algebra su(2) and su(3), and discuss the results from the
perspective of the graphs associated with the modular invariants. The
highlights of the analysis are first, that the symmetries we found in either
case are matched by the graph data in a perfect way in the case of su(2), but
in a looser way for su(3), and second, that some of the graphs lead naturally
to projective representations, both in su(2) and in su(3).
