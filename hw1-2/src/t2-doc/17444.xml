  We study the trace anomaly of the (2,0) tensor multiplet in d=6 in the
presence of a background SO(5) vector field acting as a source for the
R-current. Using both a free-field theory calculation and AdS_7/CFT_6
correspondence, we find that only one of the two possible anomaly structures is
non-zero and that its coefficient at strong-coupling differs by the well-known
overall factor 4N^3 from the corresponding weak coupling result. We also
discuss the relevance of our result to studies of the R-current anomaly in the
(2,0) multiplet.
