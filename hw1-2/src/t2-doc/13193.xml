Aspects of noncommutative descriptions of planar systems in high
  magnetic fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We study some aspects of recent proposals to use the noncommutative
Chern-Simons theory as an effective description of some planar condensed matter
models in strong magnetic fields, such as the Quantum Hall Effect. We present
an alternative justification for such a description, which may be extended to
other planar systems where a uniform magnetic field is present.
