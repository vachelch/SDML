Thermodynamics of Non-Relativistic Scattering Theory

<abstract>
  We use thermodynamic Bethe ansatz to study nonrelativistic scattering theory
of low energy excitations of 1D Hubbard model, using the $S$-matrices proposed
by E\ss ler and Korepin. This model can be described by two types of excitation
states, holons and spinons, as asymptotic states. In the attractive regime, the
spinon is massive while the holon is massless. The situation is reversed with a
repulsive coupling. We derive that the central charge of the Hubbard model in
the IR limit is $c=1$ while it vanishes in the UV limit. The contribution is
due to the massless degree of freedom, i.e. the holon for the attractive
regime, and the massive mode decouples completely. This result is consistent
with various known results based on lattice Bethe ansatz computations. Our
results make it possible to use the $S$-matrices of the excitations to compute
more interesting quantities like correlation functions.
