Towards a Classification of Knots
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the possibility of the existence of finite algorithms that may
give distinct knot classes. In particular we present two attempts for such
algorithms which seem promising, one based on knot projections on a plane, the
other on placing knots on a cubic lattice.
