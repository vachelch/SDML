A $\hbar$-deformed Virasoro Algebra as Hidden Symmetry of the Restricted
  sine-Gordon Model
</title>

<abstract>
  As the Yangian double with center,which is deformed from affine algebra by
the additive loop parameter $\hbar$ ,we get the commuting relation and the
bosonization of quantum $\hbar$-deformed Virasoro algebra. The corresponding
Miura transformation, associated screening operators and the BRST charge have
been studied. Moreover, we also constructe the bosonization for type I and type
II intertwiner vertex operators. Finally, we show that the commuting relation
of these vertex operators in the case of $p'=r p=r-1$ and $\hbar =\pi$ actually
gives the exact scattering matrix of the Restricted sine-Gordon model.
