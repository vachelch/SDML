(A)dS Backgrounds from Asymmetric Orientifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  I present asymmetric orientifold models which, with the addition of RR
fluxes, fix all the NS NS moduli including the dilaton. In critical string
theory, this gives new AdS backgrounds with (discretely tunably) weak string
coupling. Extrapolating to super-critical string theory, this construction
leads to a promising candidate for a metastable de Sitter background with
string coupling of order 1/10 and dS radius of order 100 times the string
scale. Extrapolating further to larger and larger super-critical dimension
suggests the possibility of finding de Sitter backgrounds with weaker and
weaker string coupling. This note is an updated version of the last part of my
Strings 2001 talk.
