Hamiltonian analysis of gauged CP^1 model, with or without Hopf term,
  and fractional spin
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently it has been shown by Cho and Kimm that the gauged $CP^1$ model,
obtained by gauging the global SU(2) group of $CP^1$ model and adding a
corresponding Chern-Simons term, has got its own soliton. These solitons are
somewhat distinct from those of pure $CP^1$ model, as they cannot always be
characterised by $\pi_2(CP^1)=Z$. In this paper, we first carry out the
Hamiltonian analysis of this gauged $CP^1$ model. Then we couple the Hopf term,
associated to these solitons and again carry out its Hamiltonian analysis. The
symplectic structures, along with the structures of the constraints, of these
two models (with or without Hopf term) are found to be essentially the same.
The model with Hopf term, is then shown to have fractional spin, which however
depends not only on the soliton number $N$ but also on the nonabelian charge.
