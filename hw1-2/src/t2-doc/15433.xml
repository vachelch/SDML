2D Dilaton-Maxwell Gravity as a Fixed Point of the Renormalization Group
</title>

<abstract>
  A general model of dialton-Maxwell gravity in two dimensions is investigated.
The corresponding one-loop effective action and the generalized
$\beta$-functions are obtained. A set of models that are fixed points of the
renormalization group equations are presented.
