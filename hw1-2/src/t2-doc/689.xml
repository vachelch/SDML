Inflation and the dS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  It is speculated that the observed universe has a dual representation as
renormalization group flow between two conformal fixed points of a
three-dimensional Euclidean field theory. The infrared fixed point corresponds
to the inflationary phase in the far past. The ultraviolet fixed point
corresponds to a de Sitter phase dominated by the cosmological constant
indicated in recent astronomical data. The monotonic decrease of the Hubble
parameter corresponds to the irreversibility of renormalization group flow.
