On Continuous Moyal Product Structure in String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a diagonalization of Witten's star product for a ghost system of
arbitrary background charge and Grassmann parity. To this end we use a
bosonized formulation of such systems and a spectral analysis of Neumann
matrices. We further identify a continuous Moyal product structure for a
combined ghosts+matter system. The normalization of multiplication kernel is
discussed.
