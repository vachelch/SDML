Antisymmetric tensor field on $AdS_5$
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the Hamiltonian version of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute
the two-point Green function of a local operator in D=4 N=4 super Yang-Mills
theory, which corresponds to a massive antisymmetric tensor field of the second
rank on the $AdS_{5}$ background. We discuss the conformal transformations
induced on the boundary by isometries of $AdS_{5}$.
