Twistorial superparticle with tensorial central charges
</title>

<abstract>
  A twistorial formulation of the N=1 D=4 superparticle with tensorial central
charges describing massive and massless cases in uniform manner is given. The
twistors resolve energy-momentum vector whereas the tensorial central charges
are written in term of spinor Lorentz harmonics. The model makes possible to
describe states preserving all allowed fractions of target-space supersymmetry.
The full analysis of the number of conserved supersymmetries in models with N=1
D=4 superalgebra with tensorial central charges has been carried out.
