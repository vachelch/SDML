Vacuum Energy Cancellation in a Non-supersymmetric String
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a nonsupersymmetric orbifold of type II string theory and show
that it has vanishing cosmological constant at the one and two loop level. We
argue heuristically that the cancellation persists at higher loops.
