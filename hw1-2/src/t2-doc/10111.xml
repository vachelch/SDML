Black Hole Entropy in 1+1 Dimensions from a Quasi-Chern Simons term in a
  Gravitational Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a 'quasi-topological` term [1] in D=1+1 dimensions and the
entropy for black holes is calculated [2]. The source of entropy in this case
is justified by a non-null stress-energy tensor.
