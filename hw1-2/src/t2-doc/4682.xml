Anomalies and nonperturbative results
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate nonperturbative effects in N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric theories
using a relation between perturbative and exact anomalies as a starting point.
For N=2 supersymmetric SU(n) Yang-Mills theory we derive the general structure
of the Picard-Fuchs equations; for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories we
find holomorphic part of the superpotential (with gluino condensate) exactly.
