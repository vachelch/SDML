Causal Propagators for the Second Order Wilson Loop
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate the Wilson loop at second order in general non-covariant gauges
by means of the causal principal-value prescription for the gauge- dependent
poles in the gauge-boson propagator and show that the result agrees with the
usual causal prescriptions.
