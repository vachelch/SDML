Instanton Calculus and SUSY Gauge Theories on ALE Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study instanton effects along the Coulomb branch of an N=2 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) on Asymptotically Locally Euclidean
(ALE) spaces. We focus our attention on an Eguchi-Hanson gravitational
background and on gauge field configurations of lowest Chern class.
