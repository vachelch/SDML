String Theory Duals for Mass-deformed SO(N) and USp(2N) N=4 SYM Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the results of Polchinski and Strassler regarding the
N=1-preserving mass deformation of N=4 SU(N) SYM theories and its string theory
dual to SO(N) and USp(2N) gauge groups. The string theory duals involve
5-branes wrapped on RP^2. In order to match with the field theory
classification of vacua, the 3-brane charge carried by such 5-branes must be
shifted by a half, and this follows from a conjectured generalization of
results of Freed and Witten. Our results provide an elegant physical picture
for the classification of classically massive vacua in the mass-deformed N=4
theories.
