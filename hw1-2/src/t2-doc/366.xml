Chiral Symmetry Breaking in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the SU(3)-invariant relevant deformation of D=4 N=4 SU(N) gauge
theory at large N using the AdS/CFT correspondence. At low energies, we obtain
a nonsupersymmetric gauge theory with three left-handed quarks in the adjoint
of SU(N). In terms of the five dimensional gauged supergravity, there is an
unstable critical point in the scalar potential for fluctuations of some fields
in a nontrivial representation of the symmetry group SU(3). On the field theory
side, this corresponds to dynamical breaking of the SU(3) chiral symmetry down
to SO(3). We compute the condensate of the quark bilinear and the two-point
correlation function of the spontaneously broken currents from supergravity and
find a nonzero `pion' decay constant, f_pi.
