Some Quantum Aspects of Complex Vector Fields with Chern-Simons Term
</title>

<abstract>
  Complex vector fields with Maxwell, Chern-Simons and Proca terms are
minimally coupled to an Abelian gauge field. The consistency of the spectrum is
analysed and 1-loop quantum corrections to the self-energy are explicitly
computed and discussed. The incorporation of 2-loop contributions and the
behaviour of tree-level scattering amplitudes in the limit of high
center-of-mass energies are also commented.
