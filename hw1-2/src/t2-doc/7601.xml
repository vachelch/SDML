Interpretation of the topological terms in gauge system
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide an alternative interpretation for the topological terms in physics
by investigating the low-energy gauge interacting system. The asymptotic
behavior of the gauge field at infinity indicates that it traces out a closed
loop in the infinite time interval: -infinity, + infinity. Adopting Berry's
argument of geometric phase, we show that the adiabatic evolution of the gauge
system around the loop results in an additional term to the effective action:
the Chern-Simons term for three-dimensional spacetime, and the Pontrjagin term
for the four-dimensional spacetime.
