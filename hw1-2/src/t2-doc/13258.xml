Boundary States in c=-2 Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from first principles, a constructive method is presented to obtain
boundary states in conformal field theory. It is demonstrated that this method
is well suited to compute the boundary states of logarithmic conformal field
theories. By studying the logarithmic conformal field theory with central
charge c=-2 in detail, we show that our method leads to consistent results. In
particular, it allows to define boundary states corresponding to both,
indecomposable representations as well as their irreducible subrepresentations.
