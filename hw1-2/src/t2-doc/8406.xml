Stationary Solitons of the Fifth Order KdV-type Equations and their
  Stabilization
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact stationary soliton solutions of the fifth order KdV type equation $$
u_t +\alpha u^p u_x +\beta u_{3x}+\gamma u_{5x} = 0$$ are obtained for any p
($>0$) in case $\alpha\beta>0$, $D\beta>0$, $\beta\gamma<0$ (where D is the
soliton velocity), and it is shown that these solutions are unstable with
respect to small perturbations in case $p\geq 5$. Various properties of these
solutions are discussed. In particular, it is shown that for any p, these
solitons are lower and narrower than the corresponding $\gamma = 0$ solitons.
Finally, for p = 2 we obtain an exact stationary soliton solution even when
$D,\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are all $>0$ and discuss its various properties.
