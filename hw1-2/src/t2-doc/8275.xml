``Charge-Dyon" System As The Reduced Oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown, that in the general case the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation
(reduction of $4d$ oscillator on the twistor space by the Hamiltonian action of
$U(1)$ with further time-reparametrization) leads to the integrable system,
describing the interaction of a spinless electrically charged particle with a
dyon .
