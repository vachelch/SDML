Self-duality in Super D3-brane Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish self-duality of super D3-brane theory as an exact symmetry of
the action both in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism. In the Lagrangian
formalism, the action is shown to satisfy the Gaillard-Zumino condition. This
algebraic relation is recognized in our previous paper to be a necessary and
sufficient condition for generic action of U(1) gauge field strength coupled
with gravity and matters to be self-dual. For the super D3-brane action, SO(2)
duality transformation of a world-volume gauge field should be associated with
SO(2) rotation of fermionic brane coordinates in N=2 SUSY multiplet. This SO(2)
duality symmetry is lifted to SL(2,R) symmetry in the presence of a dilaton and
an axion background fields. In the canonical formalism, we show that the
duality rotation is described by a canonical transformation, and the
Hamiltonian of the D3-brane action is invariant under the transformation.
