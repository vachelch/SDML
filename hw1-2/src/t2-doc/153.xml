Topological Effects in Medium
</title>

<abstract>
  Two closely related topological phenomena are studied at finite density and
temperature. These are chiral anomaly and Chern--Simons term. It occurs that
the chiral anomaly doesn't depend on density and temperature. Chern-Simons term
appearance in even dimensions is studied under two types of constraints: chiral
and usual charges conservation. In odd dimensions, by using different methods
it is shown that $\mu^2 = m^2$ is the crucial point for Chern--Simons at zero
temperature. So when $\mu^2 < m^2$ $\mu$--influence disappears and we get the
usual Chern-Simons term. On the other hand, when $\mu^2 > m^2$ the Chern-Simons
term vanishes because of non--zero density of background fermions. The
connection between parity anomalous Chern-Simons in odd dimension and chiral
anomaly in even dimension is established at arbitrary density and temperature.
These results hold in any dimension as in abelian, so as in nonabelian cases.
