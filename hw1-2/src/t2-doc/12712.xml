A Time-Dependent Classical Solution of C=1 String Field Theory and
  Non-Perturbative Effects
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a real-time classical solution of $c=1$ string field theory
written in terms of the phase space density, $u(p,q,t)$, of the equivalent
fermion theory. The solution corresponds to tunnelling of a single fermion
above the filled fermi sea and leads to amplitudes that go as $\exp(- C/
\gst)$. We discuss how one can use this technique to describe non-perturbative
effects in the Marinari-Parisi model. We also discuss implications of this type
of solution for the two-dimensional black hole.
