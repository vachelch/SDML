Homogeneous Plane Waves
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the search for potentially exactly solvable time-dependent
string backgrounds, we determine all homogeneous plane wave (HPW) metrics in
any dimension and find one family of HPWs with geodesically complete metrics
and another with metrics containing null singularities. The former generalises
both the Cahen-Wallach (constant $A_{ij}$) metrics to time-dependent HPWs,
$A_{ij}(t)$, and the Ozsvath-Sch\"ucking anti-Mach metric to arbitrary
dimensions. The latter is a generalisation of the known homogeneous metrics
with $A_{ij}\sim 1/t^2$ to a more complicated time-dependence. We display these
metrics in various coordinate systems, show how to embed them into string
theory, and determine the isometry algebra of a general HPW and the associated
conserved charges. We review the Lewis-Riesenfeld theory of invariants of
time-dependent harmonic oscillators and show how it can be deduced from the
geometry of plane waves. We advocate the use of the invariant associated with
the extra (timelike) isometry of HPWs for lightcone quantisation, and
illustrate the procedure in some examples.
