Holography in (2+1)-dimensional cosmological models
</title>

<abstract>
  The cosmic holographic principle suggested by Fischler and Susskind has been
examined in (2+1)-dimensional cosmological models. Analogously to the
(3+1)-dimensional counterpart, the holographic principle is satisfied in all
flat and open universes. For (2+1)-dimensional closed universes the holographic
principle cannot be realized in general. The principle cannot be maintained,
neither introducing negative pressure matter nor matter with highly
unconventional equation of state.
