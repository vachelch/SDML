Nonlocal conservation laws in N=1,2 Supersymetric KdV equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The \nl \cls for the N=1 supersymmetric KdV equation are shown to be related
in a simple way to powers of the fourth root of its Lax operator. This provides
a direct link between the supersymmetry invariance and the existence of \nl
conservation laws. It is also shown that nonlocal conservation laws exist for
the two integrable N=2 supersymmetric KdV equations whose recursion operator is
known.
