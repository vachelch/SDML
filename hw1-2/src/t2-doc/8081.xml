Domain Walls in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a detailed analysis of the domain walls in supersymmetric
gluodynamics and SQCD. We use the (corrected) Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective
Lagrangians to explicitely obtain the wall profiles and check recent results of
Dvali and Shifman (Phys. Lett. B396, (1997) 64: (i) the BPS-saturated nature of
the walls; (ii) the exact expressions for the wall energy density which depend
only on global features of dynamics (the existence of a non-trivial central
extension of N=1 superalgebra in the theories which admit wall-like solutions).
If supersymmetry is softly broken by the gluino mass, the degeneracy of the
distinct vacua is gone, and one can consider the decay rate of the "false"
vacuum into the genuine one. We do this calculation in the limit of the small
gluino mass. Finally, we comment on the controversy regarding the existence of
$N$ distinct chirally asymmetric vacua in SU(N) SUSY gluodynamics.
