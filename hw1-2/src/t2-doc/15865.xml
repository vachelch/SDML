Linearized Analysis of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati Brane Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve the Einstein equations in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model with a
static, spherically symmetric matter distribution on the physical brane and
obtain an exact expression for the gravitational field outside the source to
the first order in the gravitational coupling. Although when confined on the
physical brane this expression reproduces the correct 4D Newtonian potential
for distances r_s << r << {\lambda}, where {\lambda} is a characteristic length
scale of the model, it does not coincide with the standard linearized form of
the 4D Schwarzschild metric. The solution reproduces the 5D Schwarzschild
metric in the linearized approximation for r >> {\lambda}.
