Dynamical symmetry algebra of the Calogero model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the dynamical symmetry algebra of the N-body Calogero model
describing the structure of degenerate levels and demonstrate that the algebra
is intrisically polynomial. We discuss some general properties of an algebra of
S_N-symmetric operators acting on the S_N-symmetric subspace of the Fock space
for any statistical parameter \nu. In the bosonic case (\nu=0) we find the
algebra of generators for every N. For \nu\neq 0, we explicitly reproduce the
finite algebra for the 4-particle model, demonstrating some general features of
our construction.
