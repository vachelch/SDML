Interaction Representation in Boltzmann Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an interaction representation in the Boltzmann field theory. It
describes the master field for a subclass of planar diagrams in matrix models,
so called half-planar diagrams. This interaction representation was found in
the previous paper by Accardi, Volovich and one of us (I.A.) and it has an
unusual property that one deals with a rational function of the interaction
Lagrangian instead of the ordinary exponential function. Here we study the
interaction representation in more details and show that under natural
assumptions this representation is in fact unique. We demonstrate that
corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equations lead to a closed set of integral
equations for two- and four-point correlation functions. Renormalization of the
model is performed and renormalization group equations are obtained. Some model
examples with discrete number of degrees of freedom are solved numerically. The
solution for one degree of freedom is compared with the planar approximation
for one matrix model. For large variety of coupling constant it reproduces the
planar approximation with good accuracy.
