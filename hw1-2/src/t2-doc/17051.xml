An SU(2) Analog of the Azbel--Hofstadter Hamiltonian
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by recent findings due to Wiegmann and Zabrodin, Faddeev and
Kashaev concerning the appearence of the quantum U_q(sl(2)) symmetry in the
problem of a Bloch electron on a two-dimensional magnetic lattice, we introduce
a modification of the tight binding Azbel--Hofstadter Hamiltonian that is a
specific spin-S Euler top and can be considered as its ``classical'' analog.
The eigenvalue problem for the proposed model, in the coherent state
representation, is described by the S-gap Lam\'e equation and, thus, is
completely solvable. We observe a striking similarity between the shapes of the
spectra of the two models for various values of the spin S.
