Chern-Simons Theory as the Large Mass Limit of Topologically Massive
  Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study quantum Chern-Simons theory as the large mass limit of the limit
$D\to 3$ of dimensionally regularized topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.
This approach can also be interpreted as a BRS-invariant hybrid regularization
of Chern-Simons theory, consisting of a higher-covariant derivative Yang-Mills
term plus dimensional regularization. Working in the Landau gauge, we compute
radiative corrections up to second order in perturbation theory and show that
there is no two-loop correction to the one-loop shift $k\rightarrow k+
c_{\scriptscriptstyle V},\,\,k$ being the bare Chern-Simons parameter. In
passing we also prove by explicit computation that topologically massive
Yang-Mills theory is UV finite.
