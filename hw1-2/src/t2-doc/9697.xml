On the WKB quantum equivalence between diverse p-brane actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an action for a closed, bosonic, p-brane, where the brane tension
is not an assigned parameter but rather it is induced by a maximal rank gauge
p-form. This model is classically equivalent to the Nambu--Goto/Howe-Tucker
model. We investigate how this classical equivalence can be implemented in the
path integral framework. For this purpose we adopt a ``first order''
integration procedure over gauge p-forms and a ``shortened'' Fadeev-Popov
procedure.
