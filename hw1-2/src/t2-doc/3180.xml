The Massless Spectrum of Covariant Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the correct cohomology at any ghost number for the open and closed
covariant superstring, quantized by an approach which we recently developed. We
define physical states by the usual condition of BRST invariance and a new
condition involving a new current which is related to a grading of the
underlying affine Lie algebra.
