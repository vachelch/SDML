Note on the dual BRST Symmetry in U(1) Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the relation between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian BRST symmetry
generators for a recently proposed two-dimensional symmetry. In particular it
is shown that this symmetry may be obtained from a canonical transformation in
the ghost sector in a gauge independent way.
