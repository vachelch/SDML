Multiple vacua in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Two-dimensional SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is endowed with a non-trivial vacuum
structure (k-sectors). The presence of k-sectors modifies the energy spectrum
of the theory and its instanton content, the (Euclidean) space-time being
compactified on a sphere. For the exact solution, in the limit in which the
sphere is decompactified, a k-sector can be mimicked by the presence of
k-fundamental charges at infinity, according to a Witten's suggestion. However,
this property neither holds before decompactification nor for the genuine
perturbative solution which corresponds to the zero-instanton contribution on
the sphere.
