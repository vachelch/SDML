Quantum corrections to the kinetic term in the Randall-Sundrum model
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action of the radion in the Randall-Sundrum model is analysed.
Fine tunings are needed to obtain the observed mass hierarchy and an invisible
radion. since the kinetic terms are important for determining the radion mass,
the finite quantum corrections from massless conformally coupled fermions are
analysed and found to vanish at one loop order.
