Supergravity Predictions on Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an update on recent results about the matching between CFT operators
and KK states in the AdS/CFT correspondence, and add some new comments on the
realization of the baryonic symmetries from the supergravity point of view.
