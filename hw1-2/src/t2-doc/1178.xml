Vortices and bags in 2+1 dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the effect of the (heavy) fundamental quarks on the low energy
effective Lagrangian description of nonabelian gauge theories in 2+1
dimensions. We show that in the presence of the fundamental charges, the
magnetic $Z_N$ symmetry becomes local. We construct the effective Lagrangian
representing this local symmetry in terms of magnetic vortex fields, and
discuss its physical consequences. We show that the finite energy states
described by this Lagrangian have distinct bag-like structure. The point-like
quarks are confined to the region of space where the value of the vortex field
is much smaller than in the surrounding vacuum.
