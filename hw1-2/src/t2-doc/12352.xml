Uniqueness of the Axionic Kerr Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  Under the axisymmetry and under the invarance of simultaneous inversion of
time and azimuthal angle, we show that the axionic Kerr black hole is the ${\it
unique}$ stationary solution of the minimal coupling theory of gravity and the
Kalb-Ramond field, which has a regular event horizon, is asymptotically flat
and has a finite axion field strength at event horizon.
