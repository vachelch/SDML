Dilaton Quantum Cosmology in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a renormalizable two-dimensional model of dilaton gravity coupled
to a set of conformal fields as a toy model for quantum cosmology. We discuss
the cosmological solutions of the model and study the effect of including the
backreaction due to quantum corrections. As a result, when the matter density
is below some threshold new singularities form in a weak coupling region, which
suggests that they will not be removed in the full quantum theory. We also
solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Depending on the quantum state of the
Universe, the singularities may appear in a quantum region where the wave
function is not oscillatory, i.e., when there is not a well defined notion of
classical spacetime.
