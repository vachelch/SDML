Interaction between Noncommutative Open String and Closed-String Tachyon
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a vertex operator which describes an emission of the
ground-state tachyon of the closed string out of the noncommutative open
string. Such a vertex operator is shown to exist only when the momentum of the
closed-string tachyon is subject to some constraints coming from the background
$B$ field. The vertex operator has a multiplicative coupling constant $g(\sigma
)$ which depends on $\sigma $ as $g(\sigma)=\sin^2 \sigma $ in $0 \le \sigma
\le \pi $. This behavior is the same as in the ordinary B=0 case.
