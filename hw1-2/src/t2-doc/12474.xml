Multiloop World-Line Green Functions from String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the multiloop bosonic Green function of closed string theory
reduces to the world-line Green function as defined by Schmidt and Schubert in
the limit where the string world-sheet degenerates into a $\Phi^3$ particle
diagram. To obtain this correspondence we have to make an appropriate choice of
the local coordinates defined on the degenerate string world sheet. We also
present a set of simple rules that specify, in the explicit setting of the
Schottky parametrization, which is the corner of moduli space corresponding to
a given multiloop $\Phi^3$ diagram.
