Hamiltonian lattice gauge models and the Heisenberg double
</title>

<abstract>
Hamiltonian lattice gauge models based on the assignment of the Heisenberg
double of a Lie group to each link of the lattice are constructed in arbitrary
space-time dimensions. It is shown that the corresponding generalization of the
gauge-invariant Wilson line observables requires to attach to each vertex of
the line a vertex operator which goes to the unity in the continuum limit.
