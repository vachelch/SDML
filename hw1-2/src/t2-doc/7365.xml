Consistency conditions and trace anomalies in six dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Conformally invariant quantum field theories develop trace anomalies when
defined on curved backgrounds. We study again the problem of identifying all
possible trace anomalies in d=6 by studying the consistency conditions to
derive their 10 independent solutions. It is known that only 4 of these
solutions represent true anomalies, classified as one type A anomaly, given by
the topological Euler density, and three type B anomalies, made up by three
independent Weyl invariants. However, we also present the explicit expressions
of the remaining 6 trivial anomalies, namely those that can be obtained by the
Weyl variation of local functionals. The knowledge of the latter is in general
necessary to disentangle the universal coefficients of the type A and B
anomalies from calculations performed on concrete models.
