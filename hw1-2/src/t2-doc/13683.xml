Super Liouville Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe in superspace a classical theory of of two dimensional $(1,1)$
dilaton supergravity coupled to a super-Liouville field, and find exact super
black hole solutions to the field equations that have non-constant curvature.
We consider the possibility that a gravitini condensate forms and look at the
implications for the resultant spacetime structure. We find that all such
condensate solutions have a condensate and/or naked curvature singularity.
