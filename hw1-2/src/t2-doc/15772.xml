Hamiltonian Approach to Poisson Lie T-Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian formalism offers a natural framework for discussing the
notion of Poisson Lie T-duality. This is because the duality is inherent in the
Poisson structures alone and exists regardless of the choice of Hamiltonian.
Thus one can pose alternative dynamical systems possessing nonabelian
T-duality. As an example, we find a dual Hamiltonian formulation of the O(3)
nonlinear sigma-model. In addition, starting from a general quadratic
Hamiltonian, we easily recover the known dynamical systems having Poisson Lie
T-duality.
