Tracing the String: BMN correspondence at Finite J^2/N
</title>

<abstract>
  Employing the string bit formalism of hep-th/0209215, we identify the basis
transformation that relates BMN operators in N=4 gauge theory to string states
in the dual string field theory at finite g_2=J^2/N. In this basis, the
supercharge truncates at linear order in g_2, and the mixing amplitude between
1 and 2-string states precisely matches with the (corrected) answer of
hep-th/0206073 for the 3-string amplitude in light-cone string field theory.
Supersymmetry then predicts the order g_2^2 contact term in the string bit
Hamiltonian. The resulting leading order mass renormalization of string states
agrees with the recently computed shift in conformal dimension of BMN operators
in the gauge theory.
