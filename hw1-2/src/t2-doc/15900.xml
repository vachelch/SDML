Time and Temperature Dependent Correlation Functions of 1D Models of
  Quantum Statistical Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider gapless models of statistical mechanics. At zero temperatures
correlation functions decay asymptotically as powers of distance in these
models. Temperature correlations decay exponentially. We used an example of
solvable model to find the formula, which describes long distance and large
time asymptotic of correlation function of local fields. The formula describes
correlation at any temperature and arbitrary coupling constant.
