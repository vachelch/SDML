Mirror Symmetry and An Exact Calculation of N-2 Point Correlation
  Function on Calabi-Yau Manifold embedded in CP^{N-1}
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an (N-2)-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold which is defined as the
zero locus of the polynomial of degree N (of Fermat type) in CP^{N-1} and its
mirror manifold. We introduce the (N-2)-point correlation function (generalized
Yukawa coupling) and evaluate it both by solving the Picard-Fuchs equation for
period integrals in the mirror manifold and also by explicitly calculating the
contribution of holomorphic maps of degree 1 to the Yukawa coupling in the
Calabi-Yau manifold using the method of Algebraic geometry...
