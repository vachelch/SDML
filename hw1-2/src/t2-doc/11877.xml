LATTICE CONFORMAL THEORIES AND THEIR INTEGRABLE PERTURBATIONS
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider lattice analogues of some conformal theories, including WZW and
Toda models. We describe discrete versions of Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction and
Sugawara construction for the WZW model. We formulate perturbation theory in
chiral sector. We describe the spaces of Integrals of Motion in the perturbed
theories. We interpret the perturbed WZW model in terms of NLS hierarchy and
obtain of this model into the lattice KP-hierarchy.
