Supermultiplets of AdS Black Holes in 2+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct super AdS black holes in 2+1 dimensions in terms of Chern Simons
gauge theory of N=(1,1) super AdS group coupled to a (super)source. We take the
source to be a super AdS state specified by its Casimir invariants. We show
that the corresponding space-time is a supermultiplet of AdS space-times
related to each other by supersymmetry transformations. We give explicit
expressions for the masses and the angular momenta of the black holes in a
supermultiplet. With one exception, for N=(1,1) one pair of extremal black
holes can be accommodated in such all-black hole supermultiplets. The
requirement that the source be a unitary representation leads to a discrete
tower of excited states which provide a microscopic model for the super black
hole.
