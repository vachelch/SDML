Quasi-Exactly Solvable Models and W-Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The relationship between the quasi-exactly solvable problems and W-algebras
is revealed. This relationship enabled one to formulate a new general method
for building multi-dimensional and multi-channel exactly and quasi-exactly
solvable models with hermitian hamiltonians. The method is based on the use of
multi-parameter spectral differential equations constructable from generators
of finite-dimensional representations of simple Lie algebras and from
generators of the associated W-algebras. It is shown that algebras B(n),
C(n+1), D(2n+2) with n>1 and also algebras A(1), G(2), F(4), E(7) and E(8)
always lead to models with hermitian hamiltonians. The situation with the
remaining algebras A(n), D(2n+3) with n>1 and E(6) is still unclear.
