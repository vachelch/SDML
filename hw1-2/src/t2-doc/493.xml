N=2 Massive superparticle: the Minimality Principle and the k-symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The electromagnetic interaction of massive superparticles with N=2 extended
Maxwell supermultiplet is studied. It is proved that the minimal coupling
breaks the k-symmetry. A non-minimal k-symmetric action is built and it is
established that the k-symmetry uniquely fixes the value of the superparticle's
anomalous magnetic moment
