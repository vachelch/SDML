Non-abelian 4-d black holes, wrapped 5-branes, and their dual
  descriptions

  We study extremal and non-extremal generalizations of the regular non-abelian
monopole solution of hep-th/9707176, interpreted in hep-th/0007018 as 5-branes
wrapped on a shrinking S^2. Naively, the low energy dynamics is pure N=1
supersymmetric Yang-Mills. However, our results suggest that the scale of
confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in the Yang-Mills theory actually
coincides with the Hagedorn temperature of the little string theory. We find
solutions with regular horizons and arbitrarily high Hawking temperature.
Chiral symmetry is restored at high energy density, corresponding to large
black holes. But the entropy of the black hole solutions decreases as one
proceeds to higher temperatures, indicating that there is a thermodynamic
instability and that the canonical ensemble is ill-defined. For certain limits
of the black hole solutions, we exhibit explicit non-linear sigma models
involving a linear dilaton. In other limits we find extremal non-BPS solutions
which may have some relevance to string cosmology.
