The equations of some dispersionless limit
</title>

<abstract>
  This short article presents a table of new equations which can be regarded as
the generalized equations of the dispersionless limit of several nonlinear
equations. From the definition expressed in an algebraic formula, one can get
an equation for any positive numbers p and q. The equations were calculated by
using the computers and were examined by hand-calculation up to p=10. Relations
with some dispersionless hierarchies are mentioned.
