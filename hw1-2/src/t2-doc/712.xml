Functional Callan-Symanzik equation for QED
</title>

<abstract>
  An exact evolution equation, the functional generalization of the
Callan-Symanzik method, is given for the effective action of QED where the
electron mass is used to turn the quantum fluctuations on gradually. The usual
renormalization group equations are recovered in the leading order but no
Landau pole appears.
