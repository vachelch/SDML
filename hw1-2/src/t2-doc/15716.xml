The canonical quantization of the kink -- model beyond the static
  solution
</title>

<abstract>
  A new approach to the quantization of the relativistic kink - model around
the solitonic solution is developed on the ground of the collective coordinates
method. The corresponding effective action is proved to be the action of the
nonminimal $d=1+1$ point - particle with curvature. It is shown that upon
canonical quantization this action yields the spectrum of kink - solution
obtained firstly with the help of the WKB - quantization.
