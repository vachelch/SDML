Relative entropy in 2d Quantum Field Theory, finite-size corrections and
  irreversibility of the Renormalization Group
</title>

<abstract>
  The relative entropy in two-dimensional Field Theory is studied for its
application as an irreversible quantity under the Renormalization Group,
relying on a general monotonicity theorem for that quantity previously
established. In the cylinder geometry, interpreted as finite-temperature field
theory, one can define from the relative entropy a monotonic quantity similar
to Zamolodchikov's c function. On the other hand, the one-dimensional quantum
thermodynamic entropy also leads to a monotonic quantity, with different
properties. The relation of thermodynamic quantities with the complex
components of the stress tensor is also established and hence the entropic c
theorems are proposed as analogues of Zamolodchikov's c theorem for the
cylinder geometry.
