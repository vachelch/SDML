A Supersymmetric and Smooth Compactification of M-theory to AdS(5)
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain smooth M-theory solutions whose geometry is a warped product of
AdS_5 and a compact internal space that can be viewed as an S^4 bundle over
S^2. The bundle can be trivial or twisted, depending on the even or odd values
of the two diagonal monopole charges. The solution preserves N=2 supersymmetry
and is dual to an N=1 D=4 superconformal field theory, providing a concrete
framework to study the AdS_5/CFT_4 correspondence in M-theory. We construct
analogous embeddings of AdS_4, AdS_3 and AdS_2 in massive type IIA, type IIB
and M-theory, respectively. The internal spaces have generalized holonomy and
can be viewed as S^n bundles over S^2 for n=4, 5 and 7. Surprisingly, the
dimensions of spaces with generalized holonomy includes D=9. We also obtain a
large class of solutions of AdS\times H^2.
