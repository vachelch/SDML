A Note on Invariant Measure on the Local Gauge Group
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we investigated the problem of the existence of invariant
meaures on the local gauge group. We prove that it is impossible to define a
{\it finite} translationally invariant measure on the local gauge group
$C^{\infty}({\bf R}^n,G)$(where $G$ is an arbitrary matrix Lie group).
