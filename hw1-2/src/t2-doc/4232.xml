QUANTIZATION OF A CLASS OF PIECEWISE AFFINE TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE
  TORUS.
</title>

<abstract>
Abstract: We present a unified framework for the quantization of a family of
discrete dynamical systems of varying degrees of ``chaoticity". The systems to
be quantized are piecewise affine maps on the two-torus, viewed as phase space,
and include the automorphisms, translations and skew translations. We then
treat some discontinuous transformations such as the Baker map and the
sawtooth-like maps. Our approach extends some ideas from geometric quantization
and it is both conceptually and calculationally simple.
