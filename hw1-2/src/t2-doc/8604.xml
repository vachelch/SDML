BPS Nature of 3-String Junctions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study BPS-saturated classical solutions for the world-sheet theory of a
D-string in the presence of a point charge. These solutions are interpreted as
describing planar 3-string junctions, which arise because the original D-string
is deformed by the presence of the inserted charge. We compute the angles of
the junctions and show that the vector sum of string tensions is zero,
confirming a conjecture of Schwarz that such configurations are BPS states.
