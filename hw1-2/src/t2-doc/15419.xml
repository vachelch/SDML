Four-Point Amplitude from Open Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  An open superstring field theory action has been proposed which does not
suffer from contact term divergences. In this paper, we compute the on-shell
four-point tree amplitude from this action using the Giddings map. After
including contributions from the quartic term in the action, the resulting
amplitude agrees with the first-quantized prescription.
