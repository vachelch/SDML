Superfield effective potential
</title>

<abstract>
  A superfield method of computing the effective potential in supersymmetric
field theories is suggested. Analysis of the structure of the effective
potential in the Wess-Zumino model is carried out. It is shown that the
superfield effective potential is defined by three objects: kahlerian effective
potential, chiral effective potential and auxiliary fields' effective
potential. One-loop kahlerian effective potential is calculated using the
superfield heat kernel technique. A corresponding superfield kernel is found in
explicit form. Procedure for computing higher loop corrections is developed.
First (two-loop) correction to chiral effective potential is found. Two-loop
kahlerian effective potential is calculated.
