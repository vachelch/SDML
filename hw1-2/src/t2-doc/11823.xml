An Algebraic Bootstrap for Dimensionally Reduced Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Cylindrical gravitational waves of Einstein gravity are described by an
integrable system (Ernst system) whose quantization is a long standing problem.
We propose to bootstrap the quantum theory along the following lines: The
quantum theory is described in terms of matrix elements e.g. of the metric
operator between spectral-transformed multi-vielbein configurations. These
matrix elements are computed exactly as solutions of a recursive system of
functional equations, which in turn is derived from an underlying quadratic
algebra. The Poisson algebra emerging in its classical limit links the
spectral-transformed vielbein and the non-local conserved charges and can be
derived from first principles within the Ernst system. Among the noteworthy
features of the quantum theory are: (i) The issue of (non-)renormalizability is
sidestepped and (ii) there is an apparently unavoidable ``spontaneous''
breakdown of the SL(2,R) symmetry that is a remnant of the 4D diffeomorphism
invariance in the compactified dimensions.
