Composite gauge field models with broken symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a generalization of the non-Abelian version of the $CP^{N-1}$
models (also known as Grassmannian models) that involve composite gauge fields
to accommodate partial breaking of the non-Abelian gauge symmetry. For this to
be possible, in most cases, the constituent fields need to belong to an anomaly
free complex representation. Symmetry is broken dynamically for large $N$
primarily by a naturally generated composite scalar which simulates Higgs
mechanism. In the example studied in some detail, the gauge group SO(10) gets
broken down to subgroups like SU(5) or SU(5)$\times$U(1).
