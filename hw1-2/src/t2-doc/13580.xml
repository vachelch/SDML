Phenomenological Consequences of Non-commutative QED
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of the noncommutative QED we consider few phenomena which
reflect the noncommutativity. In all of them the new interactions in the
Feynmann diagrams that are responsible for the deviation from the standard QED
results. These deviations appear as the violations of Lorentz symmetry. We
suggest experimental situations where these effects may be observed. The extra
phases have far reaching consequences including violation of crossing symmetry.
Considering the e-p scattering and Compton scattering the electric dipole
moments of the electron and the photon is calculated.
