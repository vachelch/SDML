The D2-D6 System and a Fibered AdS Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  The system of D2 branes localized on or near D6 branes is considered. The
world-volume theory on the D2 branes is investigated, using its conjectured
relation to the near-horizon geometry. The results are in agreement with known
facts and expectations for the corresponding field theory and a rich phase
structure is obtained as a function of the energy scale and the number of
branes. In particular, for an intermediate range of the number of D6 branes,
the IR geometry is that of an AdS_4 space fibered over a compact space. This
D2-D6 system is compared to other systems, related to it by compactification
and duality and it is shown that the qualitative differences have compatible
explanations in the geometric and field-theoretic descriptions. Another system
-- that of NS5 branes located at D6 branes -- is also briefly studied, leading
to a similar phase structure.
