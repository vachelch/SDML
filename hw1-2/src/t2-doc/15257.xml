A Dual Description of the Four Dimensional Non-Linear Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The dual of the four dimensional non-linear sigma model is constructed using
techniques familiar to string theory. This construction necessitates the
introduction of a rank two antisymmetric tensor field whose properties are
examined. The physics of the dual theory and that of the original model are
compared. As an illustration we study in detail the SU(2) chiral model. We find
that the scattering amplitudes of the charged Goldstone bosons in the two
theories are in complete agreement at the one loop level.
