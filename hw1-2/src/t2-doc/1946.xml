Transformations Generalizing the Levi-Civita, Kustaanheimo-Stiefel, and
  Fock Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  Preliminary results concerning non-quadratic (and non-bijective)
transformations that exibit a degree of parentage with the well known
Levi-Civita, Kustaanheimo-Stiefel, and Fock transformations are reported in
this article. Some of the new transformations are applied to non-relativistic
quantum dynamical systems in two dimensions.
