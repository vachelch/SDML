Moduli Space Dynamics of a First-Order Vortex System
</title>

<abstract>
  The moduli space dynamics of vortices in the Jackiw-Pi model where a
non-relativistic Schrodinger field couples minimally to Chern-Simons gauge
field, is considered. It is shown that the difficulties in direct application
of Manton's method to obtain a moduli-space metric in the first order system
can be circumvented by turning the Lagrangian into a second order system. We
obtain exact metrics for some simple cases and describe how the vortices
respond to an external U(1) field. We then construct an effective Lagrangian
describing dynamics of the vortices. In addition, we clarify strong-weak
coupling duality between fundamental particles and vortices.
