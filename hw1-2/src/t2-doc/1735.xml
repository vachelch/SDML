Hodge Duality on the Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been claimed that whereas scalars can be bound to a Randall-Sundrum
brane, higher p-form potentials cannot, in contradiction with the Hodge duality
between 0-form and 3-form potentials in the five-dimensional bulk. Here we show
that a 3-form in the bulk correctly yields a 2-form on the brane, in complete
agreement with both bulk and brane duality. We also emphasize that the
phenomenon of photon screening in the Randall-Sundrum geometry is ruled out by
the bulk Einstein equation.
