Four Dimensional Black Holes in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact solutions of heterotic string theory corresponding to four-dimensional
charge Q magnetic black holes are constructed as tensor products of an
SU(2)/Z(2Q+2) WZW orbifold with a (0,1) supersymmetric SU(1,1)/U(1) WZW coset
model. The spectrum is analyzed in some detail. ``Bad'' marginal operators are
found which are argued to deform these theories to asymptotically flat black
holes. Surprising behaviour is found for small values of Q, where low-energy
field theory is inapplicable. At the minimal value Q=1, the theory degenerates.
Renormalization group arguments are given that suggest the potential
gravitational singularity of the low-energy field theory is resolved by a
massive two-dimensional field theory. At Q=0, a stable, neutral ``remnant,'' of
potential relevance to the black hole information paradox, is found.
