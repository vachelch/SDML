Orbifolds AdS_7xS^4 and Six Dimensional (0, 1) SCFT
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the relation between the large N limit of 6 dimensional
superconformal field theories with eight supercharges and M theory on orbifolds
of AdS_7xS^4. We use the known spectrum of Kaluza-Klein harmonics of
supergravity on AdS_7xS^4 and we take their orbifold projection to get
information about the chiral primary operators of 6 dimensional SCFT which is
realized on the worldvolume of M5 brane sitting at the orbifold singularities.
