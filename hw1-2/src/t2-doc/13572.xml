Flavor changing neutral current constraints on standard-like orbifold
  models
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine for standard-like orbifold compactification models the constraints
due to quarks and leptons generation non-universality of soft supersymmetry
breaking interactions. We follow the approach initiated by Ibanez and Lust and
developed by Brignole, Ibanez and Munoz. The breaking of supersymmetry is
represented in terms of dilaton and moduli auxiliary field components and,
consistently with a vanishing cosmological constant, is parametrized in terms
of the dilaton-moduli mixing angle $\theta $ and the gravitino mass scale
$m_g$. The soft breaking interactions (gaugino masses, squarks and sleptons
mass matrices, scalars interactions A and B coupling constants) are calculable
as a function of these parameters and of the discrete set of modular weight
parameters specifying the modular transformation properties of the low-energy
fields. We solve the renormalization group one-loop equations for the full set
of gauge, Yukawa and supersymmetry breaking coupling constants.
