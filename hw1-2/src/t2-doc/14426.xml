On nonequilibrium states in QFT model with boundary interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that certain nonequilibrium expectation values in the boundary
sine-Gordon model coincide with associated equilibrium-state expectation values
in the systems which differ from the boundary sine-Gordon in that certain extra
boundary degrees of freedom (q-oscillators) are added. Applications of this
result to actual calculation of nonequilibrium characteristics of the boundary
sine-Gordon model are also discussed.
