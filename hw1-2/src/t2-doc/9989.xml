Affine Toda Solitons and Systems of Calogero-Moser Type
</title>

<abstract>
  The solitons of affine Toda field theory are related to the spin-generalised
Ruijsenaars-Schneider (or relativistic Calogero-Moser) models. This provides
the sought after extension of the correspondence between the sine-Gordon
solitons and the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.
