Zero-point energies and the multiplicative anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  For the case of a relativistic scalar field at finite temperature with a
chemical potential, we calculate an exact expression for the one-loop effective
action using the full fourth order determinant and zeta-function
regularisation. We find that it agrees with the exact expression for the
factored operator and thus there appears to be no mulitplicative anomaly. The
appearance of the anomaly for the fourth order operator in the high temperature
limit is explained and we show that the multiplicative anomaly can be
calculated as the difference between two zeta-regularised zero-point energies.
This difference is a result of using a charge operator in the Hamiltonian which
has not been normal ordered.
