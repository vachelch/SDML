Harmonic Maps and Self-Dual Equations for Immersed Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The immersion of the string world sheet, regarded as a Riemann surface, in
$R^3$ and $R^4$ is described by the generalized Gauss map. When the Gauss map
is harmonic or equivalently for surfaces of constant mean curvature, we obtain
Hitchin's self-dual equations, by using $SO(3)$ and $SO(4)$ gauge fields
constructed in our earlier studies. This complements our earlier result that
$h\surd g\ =\ 1$ surfaces exhibit Virasaro symmetry. The self-dual system so
obtained is compared with self-dual Chern-Simons system and a generalized
Liouville equation involving extrinsic geometry is obtained.
  The immersion in $R^n, \ n>4$ is described by the generalized Gauss map. It
is shown that when the Gauss map is harmonic, the mean curvature of the
immersed surface is constant. $SO(n)$ gauge fields are constructed from the
geometry of the surface and expressed in terms of the Gauss map. It is found
Hitchin's self- duality relations for the gauge group $SO(2)\times SO(n-2)$.
