Supergravity Fluxbranes in Various Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate fluxbrane solutions to the Einstein-antisymmetric form-dilaton
theory in arbitrary space-time dimensions for a transverse space of cylindrical
topology $S^k\times R^n$, corresponding to smeared and unsmeared solutions. A
master equation for a single metric function is derived. This is a non-linear
second-order ordinary differential equation admitting an analytic solution,
singular at the origin, which serves as an attractor for globally regular
solutions, whose existence is demonstrated numerically. For all fluxbranes of
different levels of smearing the metric function diverges at infinity as the
same power of the radial coordinate except for the maximally smeared case,
where a global solution is known in closed form and can be obtained
algebraically using U-duality. The particular cases of F6 and F3 fluxbranes in
D=11 supergravity and fluxbranes in IIA, IIB supergravities are discussed.
