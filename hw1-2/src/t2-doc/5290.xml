Origin of Logarithmic Operators in Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study logarithmic operators in Coulomb gas models, and show that they
occur when the ``puncture'' operator of the Liouville theory is included in the
model. We also consider WZNW models for $SL(2,R)$, and for SU(2) at level 0, in
which we find logarithmic operators which form Jordan blocks for the current as
well as the Virasoro algebra.
