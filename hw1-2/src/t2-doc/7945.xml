Kinematics and uncertainty relations of a quantum test particle in a
  curved space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  A possible model for quantum kinematics of a test particle in a curved
space-time is proposed. Every reasonable neighbourhood V_e of a curved
space-time can be equipped with a nonassociative binary operation called the
geodesic multiplication of space-time points. In the case of the Minkowski
space-time, left and right translations of the geodesic multiplication coincide
and amount to a rigid shift of the space-time x->x+a. In a curved space-time
infinitesimal geodesic right translations can be used to define the (geodesic)
momentum operators. The commutation relations of position and momentum
operators are taken as the quantum kinematic algebra. As an example, detailed
calculations are performed for the space-time of a weak plane gravitational
wave. The uncertainty relations following from the commutation rules are
derived and their physical meaning is discussed.
