Boundary terms and their Hamiltonian dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  It is described how the standard Poisson bracket formulas should be modified
in order to incorporate integrals of divergences into the Hamiltonian formalism
and why this is necessary. Examples from Einstein gravity and Yang-Mills gauge
field theory are given.
