Commuting quantities and exceptional W-algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Sets of commuting charges constructed from the current of a U(1) Kac-Moody
algebra are found. There exists a set S_n of such charges for each positive
integer n > 1; the corresponding value of the central charge in the
Feigin-Fuchs realization of the stress tensor is c = 13-6n-6/n. The charges in
each series can be written in terms of the generators of an exceptional
W-algebra.
