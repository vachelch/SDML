Renormalization-group at criticality and complete analyticity of
  constrained models: a numerical study
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the majority rule transformation applied to the Gibbs measure for
the 2--D Ising model at the critical point. The aim is to show that the
renormalized hamiltonian is well defined in the sense that the renormalized
measure is Gibbsian. We analyze the validity of Dobrushin-Shlosman Uniqueness
(DSU) finite-size condition for the "constrained models" corresponding to
different configurations of the "image" system. It is known that DSU implies,
in our 2--D case, complete analyticity from which, as it has been recently
shown by Haller and Kennedy, Gibbsianness follows. We introduce a Monte Carlo
algorithm to compute an upper bound to Vasserstein distance (appearing in DSU)
between finite volume Gibbs measures with different boundary conditions. We get
strong numerical evidence that indeed DSU condition is verified for a large
enough volume $V$ for all constrained models.
