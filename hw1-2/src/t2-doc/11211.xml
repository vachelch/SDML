Fundamental Strings as Black Bodies
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the decay spectrum of massive excitations in perturbative string
theories is thermal when averaged over the (many) initial degenerate states. We
first compute the inclusive photon spectrum for open strings at the tree level
showing that a black body spectrum with the Hagedorn temperature emerges in the
averaging. A similar calculation for a massive closed string state with winding
and Kaluza-Klein charges shows that the emitted graviton spectrum is thermal
with a "grey-body" factor, which approaches one near extremality. These results
uncover a simple physical meaning of the Hagedorn temperature and provide an
explicit microscopic derivation of the black body spectrum from a unitary $S$
matrix.
