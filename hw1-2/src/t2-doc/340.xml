Canonical Chern-Simons Theory and the Braid Group on a Riemann Surface
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the problem of determining which representations of the braid
group on a Riemann surface are carried by the wave function of a quantized
Abelian Chern-Simons theory interacting with non-dynamical matter. We
generalize the quantization of Chern-Simons theory to the case where the
coefficient of the Chern-Simons term, $k$, is rational, the Riemann surface has
arbitrary genus and the total matter charge is non-vanishing. We find an
explicit solution of the Schr\"odinger equation. We find that the wave
functions carry a representation of the braid group as well as a projective
representation of the discrete group of large gauge transformations. We find a
fundamental constraint which relates the charges of the particles, $q_i$, the
coefficient $k$ and the genus of the manifold, $g$.
