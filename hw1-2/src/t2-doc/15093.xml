Temperature Independent Renormalization of Finite Temperature Field
  Theory

<abstract>
  We analyse 4-dimensional massive $\vp^4$ theory at finite temperature T in
the imaginary-time formalism. We present a rigorous proof that this quantum
field theory is renormalizable, to all orders of the loop expansion. Our main
point is to show that the counterterms can be chosen temperature independent,
so that the temperature flow of the relevant parameters as a function of $T$
can be followed. Our result confirms the experience from explicit calculations
to the leading orders. The proof is based on flow equations, i.e. on the
(perturbative) Wilson renormalization group. In fact we will show that the
difference between the theories at T>0 and at T=0 contains no relevant terms.
Contrary to BPHZ type formalisms our approach permits to lay hand on
renormalization conditions and counterterms at the same time, since both appear
as boundary terms of the renormalization group flow. This is crucial for the
proof.
