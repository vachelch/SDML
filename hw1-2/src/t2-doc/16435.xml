Faddeev-Jackiw approach to gauge theories and ineffective constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  The general conditions for the applicability of the Faddeev-Jackiw approach
to gauge theories are studied. When the constraints are effective a new proof
in the Lagrangian framework of the equivalence between this method and the
Dirac approach is given. We find, however, that the two methods may give
different descriptions for the reduced phase space when ineffective constraints
are present. In some cases the Faddeev-Jackiw approach may lose some
constraints or some equations of motion. We believe that this inequivalence can
be related to the failure of the Dirac conjecture (that says that the Dirac
Hamiltonian can be enlarged to an Extended Hamiltonian including all first
class constraints, without changes in the dynamics) and we suggest that when
the Dirac conjecture fails the Faddeev-Jackiw approach fails to give the
correct dynamics. Finally we present some examples that illustrate this
inequivalence.
