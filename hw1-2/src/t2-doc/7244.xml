SUSY and Goliath
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the `giant gravitons' of McGreevy, Susskind and Toumbas
[hep-th/0003075]. We demonstrate that these are BPS configurations which
preserve precisely the same supersymmetries as a `point-like' graviton. We also
show that there exist `dual' giant gravitons consisting of spherical branes
expanding into the AdS component of the spacetime. Finally, we discuss the
realization of the stringy exclusion principle within this expanded framework.
