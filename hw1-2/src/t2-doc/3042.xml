Open string with a background B-field as the first order mechanics and
  noncommutativity
</title>

<abstract>
  To study noncommutativity properties of the open string with constant B-field
we construct a mechanical action which reproduces classical dynamics of the
string sector under consideration. It allows one to apply the Dirac
quantization procedure for constrained systems in a direct and unambiguous way.
The mechanical action turns out to be the first order system without taking the
strong field limit $B\longrightarrow\infty$. In particular, it is true for zero
mode of the string coordinate which means that the noncommutativity is
intrinsic property of this mechanical system. We describe the arbitrariness in
the relation existent between the mechanical and the string variables and show
that noncommutativity of the string variables on the boundary can be removed.
It is in correspondence with the result of Seiberg and Witten on relation among
noncommutative and ordinary Yang-Mills theories.
