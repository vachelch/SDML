Exact Solution of Long-Range Interacting Spin Chains with Boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider integrable models of the Haldane-Shastry type with open boundary
conditions. We define monodromy matrices, obeying the reflection equation,
which generate the symmetries of these models. Using a map to the
Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian of BC type, we derive the spectrum and the
highest weight eigenstates.
