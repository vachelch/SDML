Supersymmetric Lorentz-Covariant Hyperspaces and self-duality equations
  in dimensions greater than (4|4)
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalise the notions of supersymmetry and superspace by allowing
generators and coordinates transforming according to more general Lorentz
representations than the spinorial and vectorial ones of standard lore. This
yields novel SO(3,1)-covariant superspaces, which we call hyperspaces, having
dimensionality greater than (4|4) of traditional super-Minkowski space. As an
application, we consider gauge fields on complexifications of these
superspaces; and extending the concept of self-duality, we obtain classes of
completely solvable equations analogous to the four-dimensional self-duality
equations.
