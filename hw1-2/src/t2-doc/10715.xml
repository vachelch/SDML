A simple construction of elliptic $R$-matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that Belavin's solutions of the quantum Yang--Baxter equation can be
obtained by restricting an infinite $R$-matrix to suitable finite dimensional
subspaces. This infinite $R$-matrix is a modified version of the
Shibukawa--Ueno $R$-matrix acting on functions of two variables.
