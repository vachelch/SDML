Renormalizable Non-Covariant Gauges and Coulomb Gauge Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  To study ``physical'' gauges such as the Coulomb, light-cone, axial or
temporal gauge, we consider ``interpolating'' gauges which interpolate linearly
between a covariant gauge, such as the Feynman or Landau gauge, and a physical
gauge. Lorentz breaking by the gauge-fixing term of interpolating gauges is
controlled by extending the BRST method to include not only the local gauge
group, but also the global Lorentz group. We enumerate the possible divergences
of interpolating gauges, and show that they are renormalizable, and we show
that the expectation value of physical observables is the same as in a
covariant gauge. In the second part of the article we study the Coulomb-gauge
as the singular limit of the Landau-Coulomb interpolating gauge. We find that
unrenormalized and renormalized correlation functions are finite in this limit.
We also find that there are finite two-loop diagrams of ``unphysical''
particles that are not present in formal canonical quantization in the Coulomb
gauge. We verify that in the same limit, the Gauss-BRST Ward identity holds,
which is the functional analog of the operator statement that a BRST
transformation is generated by the Gauss-BRST charge. As a consequence, $gA_0$
is invariant under renormalization, whereas in a covariant gauge, no component
of the gluon field has this property.
