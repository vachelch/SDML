On Classification of N=2 Supersymmetric Theories, (e-mail uncorrupted

</title>

<abstract>
  We find a relation between the spectrum of solitons of massive $N=2$ quantum
field theories in $d=2$ and the scaling dimensions of chiral fields at the
conformal point. The condition that the scaling dimensions be real imposes
restrictions on the soliton numbers and leads to a classification program for
symmetric $N=2$ conformal theories and their massive deformations in terms of a
suitable generalization of Dynkin diagrams (which coincides with the A--D--E
Dynkin diagrams for minimal models). The Landau-Ginzburg theories are a proper
subset of this classification. In the particular case of LG theories we relate
the soliton numbers with intersection of vanishing cycles of the corresponding
singularity; the relation between soliton numbers and the scaling dimensions in
this particular case is a well known application of Picard-Lefschetz theory.
