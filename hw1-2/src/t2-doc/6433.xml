The Initial Value Problem For Maximally Non-Local Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the initial value problem for actions which contain non-trivial
functions of integrals of local functions of the dynamical variable. In
contrast to many other non-local actions, the classical solution set of these
systems is at most discretely enlarged, and may even be restricted, with
respect to that of a local theory. We show that the solutions are those of a
local theory whose (spacetime constant) parameters vary with the initial value
data according to algebraic equations. The various roots of these algebraic
equations can be plausibly interpreted in quantum mechanics as different
components of a multi-component wave function. It is also possible that the
consistency of these algebraic equations imposes constraints upon the initial
value data which appear miraculous from the context of a local theory.
