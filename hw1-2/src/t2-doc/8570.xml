Quotient Construction of 't Hooft's Quantum Equivalence Classes
</title>

<abstract>
  Most recently 't Hooft has postulated (G 't Hooft, Class. Quant. Grav. 16
(1999) 3263-3279) that quantum states at the ``atomic scale''can be understood
as equivalence classes of primordial states governed by a dissipative
deterministic theory underlying quantum theory at the ``Planck scale''.
Defining invariant subspaces clearly for primordial states according to a given
evolution, we mathematically re-formulate 't Hooft's theory as a quotient space
construction with the time-reversible evolution operator induced naturally.
With this observation and some analysis, 't Hooft's theory is generalized
beyond his case where the evolution at the ``Planck scale'' is periodic or the
time is discrete. We also give a novel illustration that the Fock space of
quantum oscillator could follow from the quotient space construction for
certain primordial states obeying non-reversible evolution governed by a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.
