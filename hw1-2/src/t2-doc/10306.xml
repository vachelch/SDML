On Large N Gauge Theories from Orientifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider four dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories
obtained via orientifolds of Type IIB on Abelian C^3/G orbifolds. We construct
all such theories that have well defined world-sheet expansion. The number of
such orientifolds is rather limited. We explain this fact in the context of
recent developments in four dimensional Type IIB orientifolds. In particular,
we elaborate these issues in some examples of theories where world-sheet
description is inadequate due to non-perturbative (from the orientifold
viewpoint) states arising from D-branes wrapping (collapsed) 2-cycles in the
orbifold. We find complete agreement with the corresponding statements recently
discussed in the context of Type I compactifications on toroidal orbifolds.
This provides a non-trivial check for correctness of the corresponding
conclusions. We also find non-trivial agreement with various field theory
expectations, and point out their origin in string language. The orientifold
gauge theories that do possess well defined world-sheet description have the
property that in the large N limit computation of any M-point correlation
function in these theories reduces to the corresponding computation in the
parent ${\cal N}=4$ oriented theory.
