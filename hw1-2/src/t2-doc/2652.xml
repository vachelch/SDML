BPS Domain Wall Junctions in Infinitely Large Extra Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider models of scalar fields coupled to gravity which are
higher-dimensional generalizations of four dimensional supergravity. We use
these models to describe domain wall junctions in an anti-de Sitter background.
We derive Bogomolnyi equations for the scalar fields from which the walls are
constructed and for the metric. From these equations a BPS-like formula for the
junction energy can be derived. We demonstrate that such junctions localize
gravity in the presence of more than one uncompactified extra dimension.
