Black Holes and Super Black Holes as Chern Simons Theories in 2+1
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study anti-de Sitter black holes in 2+1 dimensions in terms of Chern
Simons gauge theory of the anti-de Sitter group coupled to a Source. Taking the
source to be an anti-de Sitter state specified by its Casimir invariants, we
show how all the relevant features of the black hole are accounted for.
Enlarging the gauge symmetry to super AdS group, we obtain a supermultiplet of
AdS black holes. We give explicit expressions for the masses and the angular
momenta of the members of the multiplet.
