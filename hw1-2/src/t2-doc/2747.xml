Tachyon condensation using the disc partition function
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been recently proposed that the background independent open
superstring field theory action is given by the disc partition function with
all possible open string operators inserted at the boundary of the disc. We use
this proposal to study tachyon condensation in the D0-D2 system. We evaluate
the disc partition function for the D0-D2 system in presence of a large
Neveu-Schwarz B-field using perturbation theory. This perturbative expansion of
the disc partition function makes sense as the boundary tachyon operator for
the large Neveu-Schwarz B-field is almost marginal. We find that the mass
defect for the formation of the D0-D2 bound state agrees exactly with the
expected result in the large B-field limit.
