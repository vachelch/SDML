An involution and dynamics for the $q$-deformed quantum top
</title>

<abstract>
  It is known that the involution corresponding to the compact form is
incompatible with comultiplication for quantum groups at $|q|=1$. In this paper
we consider the quantum algebra of functions on the deformed space $T^{*}G_{q}$
which includes both the quantum group and the quantum universal enveloping
algebra as subalgebras. For this extended object we construct an
anti-involution which reduces to the compact form $*$-operation in the limit
$q\rightarrow 1$. The algebra of functions on $T^{*}G_{q}$ endowed with the
$*$-operation may be viewed as an algebra of observables of a quantum
mechanical system. The most natural interpretation for such a system is a
deformation of the quantum symmetric top. We suggest a discrete dynamics for
this system which imitates the free motion of the top.
