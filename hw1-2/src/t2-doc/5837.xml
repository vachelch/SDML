<title>
Supersymmetric Gauge Anomaly with General Homotopic Paths
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the method of Banerjee, Banerjee and Mitra and minimal homotopy paths
to compute the consistent gauge anomaly for several superspace models of SSYM
coupled to matter. We review the derivation of the anomaly for N=1 in four
dimensions and then discuss the anomaly for two-dimensional models with (2,0)
supersymmetry.
