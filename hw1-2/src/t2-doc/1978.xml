Supersolutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop classical globally supersymmetric theories. As much as possible,
we treat various dimensions and various amounts of supersymmetry in a uniform
manner. We discuss theories both in components and in superspace. Throughout we
emphasize geometric aspects. The beginning chapters give a general discussion
about supersymmetric field theories; then we move on to detailed computations
of lagrangians, etc. in specific theories. An appendix details our sign
conventions. This text will appear in a two-volume work "Quantum Fields and
Strings: A Course for Mathematicians" to be published soon by the American
Mathematical Society. Some of the cross-references may be found at
