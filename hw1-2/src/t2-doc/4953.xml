A method for obtaining quantum doubles from the Yang-Baxter R-matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop the approach of Faddeev, Reshetikhin, Takhtajan [1] and of Majid
[2] that enables one to associate a quasitriangular Hopf algebra to every
regular invertible constant solution of the quantum Yang-Baxter equations. We
show that such a Hopf algebra is actually a quantum double.
