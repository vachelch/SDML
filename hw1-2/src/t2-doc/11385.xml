On Unconstrained SU(2) Gluodynamics with Theta Angle
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian reduction of classical SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory to the
equivalent unconstrained theory of gauge invariant local dynamical variables is
generalized to the case of nonvanishing theta angle. It is shown that for any
theta angle the elimination of the pure gauge degrees of freedom leads to a
corresponding unconstrained nonlocal theory of self-interacting second rank
symmetric tensor fields, and that the obtained classical unconstrained
gluodynamics with different theta angles are canonically equivalent as on the
original constrained level.
