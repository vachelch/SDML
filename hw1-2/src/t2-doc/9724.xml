Two Dimensional Mirror Symmetry From M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct two dimensional gauge theories with $N= (4,4)$ supersymmetry
from branes of type IIA string theory. Quantum effects in the two dimensional
gauge theory are analyzed by embedding the IIA brane construction into
M-theory. We find that the Coulomb branch of one theory and the Higgs branch of
a mirror theory become equivalent at strong coupling. A relationship to the
decoupling limit of the type IIA and IIB 5-branes in Matrix theory is shown.
T-duality between the ALE metric and the wormhole metric of Callan, Harvey, and
Strominger is discussed from a brane perspective and some puzzles regarding
string duality resolved. We comment on the existence of a quantum Higgs branch
in two dimensional theories. Branes prove to be useful tools in analyzing
singular conformal field theories.
