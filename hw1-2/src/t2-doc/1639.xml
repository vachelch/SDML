Quantum Field Theory with Null-Fronted Metrics
</title>

<abstract>
  There is a large class of classical null-fronted metrics in which a free
scalar field has an infinite number of conservation laws. In particular, if the
scalar field is quantized, the number of particles is conserved. However, with
more general null-fronted metrics, field quantization cannot be interpreted in
terms of particle creation and annihilation operators, and the physical meaning
of the theory becomes obscure.
