D-brane Inflation
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a calculable version of brane inflation, in which a set of
parallel D-brane and anti-D-brane worlds, initially displaced in extra
dimension, slowly attract each other. In the effective four-dimensional theory
this slow motion of branes translates into a slow-roll of a scalar field
(proportional to their separation) with a flat potential that drives inflation.
The number of possible e-foldings is severely constrained. The scalar spectral
index is found to be 0.97, while the effective compactification scale is of
order $10^{12}$ GeV. Reheating of the Universe is provided by collision and
subsequent annihilation of branes.
