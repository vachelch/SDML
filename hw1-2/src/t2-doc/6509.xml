Towards a SDLCQ test of the Maldacena Conjecture
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Maldacena conjecture applied to the near horizon geometry of
a D1-brane in the supergravity approximation and present numerical results of a
test of the conjecture against the boundary field theory calculation using
DLCQ. We previously calculated the two-point function of the stress-energy
tensor on the supergravity side; the methods of Gubser, Klebanov, Polyakov, and
Witten were used. On the field theory side, we derived an explicit expression
for the two-point function in terms of data that may be extracted from the
supersymmetric discrete light cone quantization (SDLCQ) calculation at a given
harmonic resolution. This yielded a well defined numerical algorithm for
computing the two-point function. For the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with
16 supercharges that arises in the Maldacena conjecture, the algorithm is
perfectly well defined; however, the size of the numerical computation
prevented us from obtaining a numerical check of the conjecture. We now present
numerical results with approximately 1000 times as many states as we previously
considered. These results support the Maldacena conjecture and are within
$10-15%$ of the predicted numerical results in some regions. Our results are
still not sufficient to demonstrate convergence, and, therefore, cannot be
considered to a numerical proof of the conjecture. We present a method for
using a ``flavor'' symmetry to greatly reduce the size of the basis and discuss
a numerical method that we use which is particularly well suited for this type
of matrix element calculation.
