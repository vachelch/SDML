Universailty of Low Energy Absorption Cross-sections for Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we compute the low energy absorption cross-section for
minimally coupled massles scalars and spin-$1/2$ particles, into a general
spherically symmetric black hole in arbitrary dimensions. The scalars have a
cross section equal to the area of the black hole, while the spin-$1/2$
particles give the area measured in a flat spatial metric conformally related
to the true metric.
