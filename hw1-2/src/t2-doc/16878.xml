Origin of Matter from Vacuum in Conformal Cosmology

<abstract>
  We introduce the hypothesis that the matter content of the universe can be a
product of the decay of primordial vector bosons.
 The effect of the intensive cosmological creation of these primordial vector
$W, ~Z $ bosons from the vacuum is studied in the framework of General
Relativity and the Standard Model where the relative standard of measurement
identifying conformal quantities with the measurable ones is accepted.
 The relative standard leads to the conformal cosmology with the z-history of
masses with the constant temperature, instead of the conventional z-history of
the temperature with constant masses in inflationary cosmology.
 In conformal cosmology both the latest supernova data and primordial
nucleosynthesis are compatible with a stiff equation of state associated with
one of the possible states of the infrared gravitation field.
 The distribution function of the created bosons in the lowest order of
perturbation theory exposes a cosmological singularity as a consequence of the
theorem about the absence of the massless limit of massive vector fields in
quantum theory. This singularity can be removed by taking into account the
collision processes leading to a thermalization of the created particles. The
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature T=(M_W^2H_0)^{1/3} ~ 2.7 K occurs
as an integral of motion for the universe in the stiff state. We show that this
temperature can be attained by the CMB radiation being the final product of the
decay of primordial bosons.
 The effect of anomalous nonconservation of baryon number due to the
polarization of the Dirac sea vacuum by these primordial bosons is considered.
