Towards a Canonical Formalism of Field Theory on Discrete Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the difficulties in formulating the quantum field theory on
discrete spacetime appear already in classical dynamics of one degree of
freedom on discrete time. The difference equation of motion which maintains a
conserved quantity like energy has a very restricted form that is not probably
derived by the least action principle. On the other hand, the classical
dynamics is possible to be canonically formulated and quantized, if the
equation is derived from an action. The difficulties come mainly from this
incompatibility of the conserved quantity and the action principle. We
formulate a quantum field theory canonically on discrete spacetime in the case
where the field equation is derived from an action, though there may be no
exactly conserved quantity. It may, however, be expected that a conserved
quantity exists for a low "energy" region.
