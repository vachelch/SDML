The Heterotic Life of the D-particle
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the dynamics of D-particles (D0-branes) in type I' string theory and
of the corresponding states in the dual heterotic description. We account for
the presence of the two 8-orientifolds (8 dimensional orientifold planes) and
sixteen D8-branes by deriving the appropriate quantum mechanical system. We
recover the familiar condition of eight D8-branes for each 8-orientifold. We
investigate bound states and compute the phase shifts for the scattering of
such states and find that they agree with the expectations from the
supergravity action. In the type I' regime we study the motion transverse to
the 8-orientifold and find an interesting cancellation effect.
