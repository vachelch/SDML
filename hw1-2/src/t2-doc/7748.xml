On electromagnetic interaction of massive spin-2 particle
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we construct a gauge invariant description of free massive
particle with an arbitrary integer spin. Such description allows one to
investigate the problem of consistent interactions for massive high spin
particles using the requirement that the whole interaction Lagrangian must be
gauge invariant. As a first example of such approach, we consider the case of
electromagnetic interaction of massive spin-2 particle: a linear approximation
in a case of the arbitrary field and a full theory for the homogeneous
electromagnetic field in the space-time of any dimensionality.
