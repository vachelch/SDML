Symmetry, Integrable Chain Models and Stochastic Processes
</title>

<abstract>
  A general way to construct chain models with certain Lie algebraic or quantum
Lie algebraic symmetries is presented. These symmetric models give rise to
series of integrable systems. As an example the chain models with $A_n$
symmetry and the related Temperley-Lieb algebraic structures and
representations are discussed. It is shown that corresponding to these $A_n$
symmetric integrable chain models there are exactly solvable stationary
discrete-time (resp. continuous-time) Markov chains whose spectra of the
transition matrices (resp. intensity matrices) are the same as the ones of the
corresponding integrable models.
