Supersymmetric D2 anti-D2 Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the flat supersymmetric D2 and anti-D2 system, which follows from
ordinary noncommutative D2 anti-D2 branes by turning on an appropriate
worldvolume electric field describing dissolved fundamental strings. We study
the strings stretched between D2 and anti-D2 branes and show explicitly that
the would-be tachyonic states become massless. We compute the string spectrum
and clarify the induced noncommutativity on the worldvolume. The results are
compared with the matrix theory description of the worldvolume gauge theories.
