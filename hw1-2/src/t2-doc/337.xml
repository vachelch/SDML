String-string duality for some black hole type solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the duality transformation relating the heterotic to the IIA string
in 6D to the class of exact string solutions described by the chiral null model
and derive explicit formulas for all fields after reduction to 4D. If the model
is restricted to asymptotically flat black hole type solutions with well
defined mass and charges the purely electric solutions on the heterotic side
are mapped to dyonic ones on the IIA side. The mass remains invariant. Before
and after the duality transformation the solutions belong to short $N=4$ SUSY
multiplets and saturate the corresponding Bogomol'nyi bounds.
