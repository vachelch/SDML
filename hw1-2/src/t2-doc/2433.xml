2+1 dimensional charged black hole with (anti-)self dual Maxwell fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the exact electrically charged BTZ black hole solutions to the
Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant in 2+1
spacetime dimensions assuming a (anti-)self dual condition between the
electromagnetic fields. In a coordinate condition there appears a logarithmic
divergence in the angular momentum at spatial infinity. We show how it is to be
regularized by taking the contribution from the boundary into account. We show
another coordinate condition which leads to a finite angular momentum though it
brings about a peculiar spacetime topology.
