Representations of $SO(5)_{q}$ and Non-Minimal $q$-Deformation
</title>

<abstract>
  Representations of $SO(5)_{q}$ can be constructed on bases such that either
the Chevalley triplet $(e_{1},\;f_{1},\;h_{1})$ or $(e_{2},\;f_{2},\;h_{2})$
has the standard $SU(2)_{q}$ matrix elements. The other triplet in each cases
has a more complicated action. The $q$-deformation of such representations
present striking differences. In one case a {\bf non-minimal} deformation is
found to be essential. This is explained and illustrated below. Broader
interests of a parallel use of the two bases are pointed out.
