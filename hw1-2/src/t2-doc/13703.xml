Poisson-Sigma-Models: A Generalization of 2-D Gravity Yang-Mills-Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  A new class of two dimensional integrable field theories, based on the
mathematical notion of Poisson manifolds, and containing gravity-Yang-Mills
systems as well as the G/G gauged Wess-Zumino Witten-model, are presented. The
local solutions of the classical equations of motions as well as a scheme for
the quantization in a Hamiltonian formulation is presented for the general
model. Partial results of a calculation of the partition function on arbitrary
Riemann surfaces via path integral techniques are given. (Contribution to the
proceedings of the Conference on Integrable Systems at the JINR, Dubna, July
1994).
