MORE ON THE LINEARIZATION OF $W$-ALGEBRAS
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a wide class of $W$-(super)algebras, including $W_N^{(N-1)}$,
$U(N)$-superconformal as well as $W_N$ nonlinear algebras, can be linearized by
embedding them as subalgebras into some {\em linear} (super)conformal algebras
with finite sets of currents. The general construction is illustrated by the
example of $W_4$ algebra.
