Dynamical Poincare Symmetry Realized by Field-dependent Diffeomorphisms
</title>

<abstract>
  We present several Galileo invariant Lagrangians, which are invariant against
Poincare transformations defined in one higher (spatial) dimension. Thus these
models, which arise in a variety of physical situations, provide a
representation for a dynamical (hidden) Poincare symmetry. The action of this
symmetry transformation on the dynamical variables is nonlinear, and in one
case involves a peculiar field-dependent diffeomorphism. Some of our models are
completely integrable, and we exhibit explicit solutions.
