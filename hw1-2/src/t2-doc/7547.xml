Topological interpretation of Dirac equation and geometrisation of
  electromagnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  A new concept of geometrization of electromagnetic field is proposed. Instead
of the concept of extended field and its point sources, the interacting
Maxwellian and Dirac electron--positron fields are considered as a microscopic
unified closed connected nonmetrized space--time 4-manifold. Within this
approach, the Dirac equation proves to be a group-theoretic relation that
accounts for the topological and metric properties of this manifold. The Dirac
spinors serve as basis functions of its fundamental group representation, while
the tensor components of electromagnetic field prove to be the components of a
curvature tensor of the relevant covering space. A basic distinction of the
suggested approach from the geometrization of gravitational field in general
relativity is that, first, not only the field is geometrized but also are its
microscopic sources and, second, the field and its sources are treated not as a
metrized Riemannian space--time but as a nonmetrized space-- time manifold. A
possibility to geometrize weak interaction is also discussed.
