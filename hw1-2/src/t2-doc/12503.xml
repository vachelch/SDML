Nonequilibrium problems in quantum field theory and Schwinger's Closed
  Time Path formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the closed time path formalism of Schwinger using a path integral
approach. We apply this formalism to the study of pair production from strong
external fields as well as the time evolution of a nonequilibrium chiral phase
transition.
