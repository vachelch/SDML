Interactions of strings and D-branes from M theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the relation between M theory and type II string theories. We show
that, assuming ``natural'' interactions between membranes and fivebranes in M
theory, the known interactions between strings and D-branes in type II string
theories arise in appropriate limits. Our discussion of the interactions is
purely at the classical level. We remark on issues associated with the M theory
approach to enhanced gauge symmetries, which deserve further investigation.
