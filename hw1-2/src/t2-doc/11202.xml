CFT fusion rules, DHR gauge groups, and CAR algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  It is demonstrated that several series of conformal field theories, while
satisfying braid group statistics, can still be described in the conventional
setting of the DHR theory, i.e. their superselection structure can be
understood in terms of a compact DHR gauge group. Besides theories with only
simple sectors, these include (the untwisted part of) c=1 orbifold theories and
level two so(N) WZW theories. We also analyze the relation between these models
and theories of complex free fermions.
