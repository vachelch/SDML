D-branes as Solitons of an N=1, D=10 Non-commutative Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a Dp brane within a D9 brane in the presence of a B-field whose
polarization is {\em transverse} to the Dp brane. To be definite, we take a
D3-D9 system. It is observed that the system has the same pattern of
supersymmetry breaking as that of a soliton of the six dimensional
non-commutative gauge theory that is obtained by dimensional reduction of an
{\cal N}=1, D=10 gauge theory. These results indicate that the soliton solution
is the low energy realization of a D3 brane in a D9 brane with a transverse
B-field, hence can be viewed as a generalization of the previous results in the
literature where similar observations were made for lower codimensional cases.
