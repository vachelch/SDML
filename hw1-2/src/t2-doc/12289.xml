An Exact Solution to Seiberg-Witten Equation of Noncommutative Gauge
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive an exact expression for the Seiberg-Witten map of noncommutative
gauge theory. It is found by studying the coupling of the gauge field to the
Ramond-Ramond potentials in string theory. Our result also proves the earlier
conjecture by Liu.
