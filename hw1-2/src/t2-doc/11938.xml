Superembeddings, Non-Linear Supersymmetry and 5-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine general properties of superembeddings, i.e., embeddings of
supermanifolds into supermanifolds. The connection between an embedding
procedure and the method of non-linearly realised supersymmetry is clarified,
and we demonstrate how the latter arises as a special case of the former. As an
illustration, the super-5-brane in 7 dimensions, containing a self-dual 3-form
world-volume field strength, is formulated in both languages, and provides an
example of a model where the embedding condition does not suffice to put the
theory on-shell.
