A Simple Action for a Free Anyon
</title>

<abstract>
  By studying classical realizations of the sl(2,R) algebra in a two
dimensional phase space $(q,\pi)$, we have derived a continuous family of new
actions for free anyons in 2+1 dimensions. For the case of light-like spin
vector $(S_\mu S^\mu =0)$, the action is remarkably simple. We show the
appearence of the Zitterbewegung in the solutions of the equations of motion,
and relate the actions to others in the literature at classical level.
