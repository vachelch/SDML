Operator product expansion of the energy momentum tensor in 2D conformal
  field theories on manifolds with boundary

  Starting from the well-known expression for the trace anomaly we derive the
$T\cdot T$ operator product expansion of the energy-momentum tensor in 2D
conformal theories defined in the upper halfplane $without$ making use of the
additional condition of no energy-momentum flux across the boundary. The OPE
turns out to be the same as in the absence of the boundary. For this result it
is crucial that the trace anomaly is proportional to the Gau\ss-Bonnet density.
Some relations to the $\sigma$ - model approach for open strings are discussed.
