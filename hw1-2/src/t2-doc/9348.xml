A New Solution of the Supersymmetric TJ Model by Means of the Quantum
  Inverse Scattering Method
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the enveloping fundamental spin model of the t-J hamiltonian
using the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method (QISM), and present all three
possible Algebraic Bethe Ans\"atze. Two of the solutions have been previously
obtained in the framework of Coordinate Space Bethe Ansatz by Sutherland and by
Schlottmann and Lai, whereas the third solution is new. The formulation of the
model in terms of the QISM enables us to derive explicit expressions for higher
conservation laws.
