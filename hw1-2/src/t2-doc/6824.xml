Quantum gravity and spin 1/2 particles effective dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum gravity phenomenology opens up the possibility of probing Planck
scale physics. Thus, by exploiting the generic properties that a semiclassical
state of the compound system fermions plus gravity should have, an effective
dynamics of spin-1/2 particles is obtained within the framework of loop quantum
gravity. Namely, at length scales much larger than Planck length and below the
wave length of the fermion, the spin-1/2 dynamics in flat spacetime includes
Planck scale corrections. In particular we obtain modified dispersion relations
in vacuo for fermions. These corrections yield a time of arrival delay of the
spin 1/2 particles with respect to a light signal and, in the case of
neutrinos, a novel flavor oscillation. To detect these effects the
corresponding particles must be highly energetic and should travel long
distances. Hence Neutrino Bursts accompanying Gamma Ray Bursts or ultra high
energy cosmic rays could be considered. Remarkably, future neutrino telescopes
may be capable to test such effects. This paper provides a detailed account of
the calculations and elaborates on results previously reported in a Letter.
These are further amended by introducing a real parameter Upsilon aimed at
encoding our lack of knowledge of scaling properties of the gravitational
degrees of freedom.
