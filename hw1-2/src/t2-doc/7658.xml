Anomalous dimensions and ghost decoupling in a perturbative approach to
  the generalized chiral Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalized chiral Schwinger model is studied by means of perturbative
techniques. Explicit expressions are obtained, both for bosonic and fermionic
propagators, and compared to the ones derived by means of functional
techniques. In particular a consistent recipe is proposed to describe the
ambiguity occurring in the regularization of the fermionic determinant. The
role of the gauge fixing term, which is needed to develop perturbation theory
and the behaviour of the spectrum as a function of the parameters are clarified
together with ultraviolet and infrared properties of the model.
