Mother Moose: Generating Extra Dimensions from Simple Groups at Large N
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that there exists a correspondence between four dimensional gauge
theories with simple groups and higher dimensional gauge theories at large N.
As an example, we show that a four dimensional {N}=2 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge
theory, on the Higgs branch, has the same correlators as a five dimensional
SU(N) gauge theory in the limit of large N provided the couplings are
appropriately rescaled. We show that our results can be applied to the AdS/CFT
correspondence to derive correlators of five or more dimensional gauge theories
from solutions of five dimensional supergravity in the large t'Hooft coupling
limit.
