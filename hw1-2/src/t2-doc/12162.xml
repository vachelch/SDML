Constraints on Black Hole Remnants
</title>

<abstract>
  One possible fate of information lost to black holes is its preservation in
black hole remnants. It is argued that a type of effective field theory
describes such remnants (generically referred to as informons). The general
structure of such a theory is investigated and the infinite pair production
problem is revisited. A toy model for remnants clarifies some of the basic
issues; in particular, infinite remnant production is not suppressed simply by
the large internal volumes as proposed in cornucopion scenarios. Criteria for
avoiding infinite production are stated in terms of couplings in the effective
theory. Such instabilities remain a problem barring what would be described in
that theory as a strong coupling conspiracy. The relation to euclidean
calculations of cornucopion production is sketched, and potential flaws in that
analysis are outlined. However, it is quite plausible that pair production of
ordinary black holes (e.g. Reissner Nordstrom or others) is suppressed due to
strong effective couplings. It also remains an open possibility that a
microscopic dynamics can be found yielding an appropriate strongly coupled
effective theory of neutral informons without infinite pair production.
