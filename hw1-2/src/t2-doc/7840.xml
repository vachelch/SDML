On Subleading Contributions to the AdS/CFT Trace Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we perform a direct computation
in AdS_5 supergravity of the trace anomaly of a d=4, N=2 SCFT. We find
agreement with the field theory result up to next to leading order in the 1/N
expansion. In particular, the order N gravitational contribution to the anomaly
is obtained from a Riemann tensor squared term in the 7-brane effective action
deduced from heterotic - type I duality. We also discuss, in the AdS/CFT
context, the order N corrections to the trace anomaly in d=4, N=4 SCFTs
involving SO or Sp gauge groups.
