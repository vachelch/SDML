Counting BPS Blackholes in Toroidal Type II String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a $U$-duality invariant formula for the degeneracies of BPS
multiplets in a D1-D5 system for toroidal compactification of the type II
string. The elliptic genus for this system vanishes, but it is found that BPS
states can nevertheless be counted using a certain topological partition
function involving two insertions of the fermion number operator. This is
possible due to four extra toroidal U(1) symmetries arising from a Wigner
contraction of a large $\CN=4$ algebra $\CA_{\kappa,\kappa'}$ for $\kappa' \to
\infty$. We also compare the answer with a counting formula derived from
supergravity on $AdS_3\times S^3 \times T^4$ and find agreement within the
expected range of validity.
