(m,n)-Strings In IIB Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  By adding gauge fields to the D-string classical solution, which have
non-zero contribution to commutators in continuum limit (extreme large $N$), we
introduced $(m,n)$-strings in IIB matrix model. It is found that the size of
matrices depends on the value of the electric field. The tension of these
strings appears in $SL(2,Z)$ invariant form. The interaction for parallel and
angled strings are found in agreement with the string theory for small electric
fields.
