Static and non-static quantum effects in two-dimensional dilaton gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study backreaction effects in two-dimensional dilaton gravity. The
backreaction comes from an $R^2$ term which is a part of the one-loop effective
action arising from massive scalar field quantization in a certain
approximation. The peculiarity of this term is that it does not contribute to
the Hawking radiation of the classical black hole solution of the field
equations. In the static case we examine the horizon and the physical
singularity of the new black hole solutions. Studying the possibility of time
dependence we see the generation of a new singularity. The particular solution
found still has the structure of a black hole, indicating that non-thermal
effects cannot lead, at least in this approximation, to black hole evaporation.
