Domain Walls of D=8 Gauged Supergravities and their D=11 Origin
</title>

<abstract>
  Performing a Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction of D=11 supergravity on a
three-dimensional group manifold we construct five D=8 gauged maximal
supergravities whose gauge groups are the three-dimensional (non-)compact
subgroups of SL(3,R). These cases include the Salam-Sezgin SO(3) gauged
supergravity. We construct the most general half-supersymmetric domain wall
solutions to these five gauged supergravities. The generic form is a triple
domain wall solution whose truncations lead to double and single domain wall
solutions. We find that one of the single domain wall solutions has zero
potential but nonzero superpotential.
  Upon uplifting to 11 dimensions each domain wall becomes a purely
gravitational 1/2 BPS solution. The corresponding metric has a 7+4 split with a
Minkowski 7-metric and a 4-metric that corresponds to a gravitational
instanton. These instantons generalize the SO(3) metric of Belinsky, Gibbons,
Page and Pope (which includes the Eguchi-Hanson metric) to the other Bianchi
types of class A.
