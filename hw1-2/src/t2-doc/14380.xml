On Feynman's Approach to the Foundations of Gauge Theory

<abstract>
  In 1948, Feynman showed Dyson how the Lorentz force and Maxwell equations
could be derived from commutation relations coordinates and velocities. Several
authors noted that the derived equations are not Lorentz covariant and so are
not the standard Maxwell theory. In particular, Hojman and Shepley proved that
the existence of commutation relations is a strong assumption, sufficient to
determine the corresponding action, which for Feynman's derivation is of
Newtonian form. Tanimura generalized Feynman's derivation to a Lorentz
covariant form, however, this derivation does not lead to the standard Maxwell
theory either. Tanimura's force equation depends on a fifth ({\it scalar})
electromagnetic potential, and the invariant evolution parameter cannot be
consistently identified with the proper time of the particle motion. Moreover,
the derivation cannot be made reparameterization invariant; the scalar
potential causes violations of the mass-shell constraint which this invariance
should guarantee. In this paper, we examine Tanimura's derivation in the
framework of the proper time method in relativistic mechanics, and use the
technique of Hojman and Shepley to study the unconstrained commutation
relations. We show that Tanimura's result then corresponds to the
five-dimensional electromagnetic theory previously derived from a
Stueckelberg-type quantum theory in which one gauges the invariant parameter in
the proper time method. This theory provides the final step in Feynman's
program of deriving the Maxwell theory from commutation relations; the Maxwell
theory emerges as the ``correlation limit'' of a more general gauge theory, in
which it is properly contained.
