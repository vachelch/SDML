Canonical Chern-Simons Theory and the Braid Group on a Riemann Surface
</title>

<abstract>
  We find an explicit solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for a Chern-Simons
theory coupled to charged particles on a Riemann surface, when the coefficient
of the Chern-Simons term is a rational number (rather than an integer) and
where the total charge is zero. We find that the wave functions carry a
projective representation of the group of large gauge transformations. We also
examine the behavior of the wave function under braiding operations which
interchange particle positions. We find that the representation of both the
braiding operations and large gauge transformations involve unitary matrices
which mix the components of the wave function. The set of wave functions are
expressed in terms of appropriate Jacobi theta functions. The matrices form a
finite dimensional representation of a particular (well known to
mathematicians) version of the braid group on the Riemann surface. We find a
constraint which relates the charges of the particles, $q$, the coefficient of
the Chern-Simons term, $k$ and the genus of the manifold, $g$: $q^2(g-1)/k$
must be an integer. We discuss a duality between large gauge transformations
and braiding operations.
