Non-parallel Electric and Magnectic Fields in a Gravitational
  Background, Stationary Gravitational Waves and Gravitons
</title>

<abstract>
  The existence of an electromagnectic field with parallel electric and
magnetic components is readdressed in the presence of a gravitational field. A
non-parallel solution is shown to exist. Next, we analyse the possibility of
finding stationary gravitational waves in de nature. Finaly, We construct a D=4
effective quantum gravity model. Tree-level unitarity is verified.
