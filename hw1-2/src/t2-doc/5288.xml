Restoring Reality for the Self-Dual N=2 String
</title>

<abstract>
  It is known that the critical N=(2,2) string describes 2+2 dimensional
self-dual gravity in a non-covariant form, since it requires the choice of a
complex structure in the target, which leaves only U(1,1) Lorentz symmetry. We
briefly review picture-changing and spectral flow and show that the world-sheet
Maxwell instantons individually break the Lorentz group further to SU(1,1).
However, their contributions conspire to restore full SO(2,2) global symmetry
if dilaton and axion fields are assembled in a null anti-self-dual two-form,
denying them the status of Lorentz scalars. We present the fully SO(2,2)
invariant tree-level three-point amplitude and the corresponding extension of
the Plebanski action for self-dual gravity.
