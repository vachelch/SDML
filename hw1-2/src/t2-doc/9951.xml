Critical amplitudes and mass spectrum of the 2D Ising model in a
  magnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the spectrum and several critical amplitudes of the two
dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field with the transfer matrix method.
The three lightest masses and their overlaps with the spin and the energy
operators are computed on lattices of a width up to L=21. In extracting the
continuum results we also take into account the corrections to scaling due to
irrelevant operators. In contrast with previous Monte Carlo simulations our
final results are in perfect agreement with the predictions of S-matrix and
conformal field theory. We also obtain the amplitudes of some of the subleading
corrections, for which no S-matrix prediction has yet been obtained.
