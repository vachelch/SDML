Scale Invariance of Dirac Condition $g_e g_m = 1$ in Type 0 String
  Approach to Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we shall discuss a description of non-supersymmetric
four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory based on Type 0 strings recently proposed by
Klebanov and Tseytlin. The three brane near-horizon geometry allows one to
study the UV behaviour of the gauge theory. Following Minahan and Klebanov and
Tseytlin we shall discuss how the gravity solution reproduces logarithmic
renormalization of coupling constant $g_e$ extracted from quark-antiquark
potential and then show that effective coupling constant $g_m$ describing
monopole-antimonopole interactions is of zero-charge type and Dirac condition
$g_e g_m = 1$ is scale invariant in logarithmic approximation.
