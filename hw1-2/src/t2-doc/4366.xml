Three-Dimensional Gauge Dynamics from Brane Configurations with
  (p,q)-Fivebrane
</title>

<abstract>
  We study three-dimensional gauge dynamics by using type IIB superstring brane
configurations, which can be obtained from the M-theory configuration of
M2-branes stretched between two M5-branes with relative angles. Our
construction of brane configurations includes (p,q)5-brane and gives a
systematic classification of possible three-dimensional gauge theories. The
explicit identification of gauge theories are made and their mirror symmetry is
discussed. As a new feature, our theories include interesting
Maxwell-Chern-Simons system whose vacuum structure is also examined in detail,
obtaining results consistent with the brane picture.
