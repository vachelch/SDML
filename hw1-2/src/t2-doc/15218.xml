Non-BPS Brane Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We study cosmology on a BPS D3-brane evolving in the 10D SUGRA background
describing a non-BPS brane. Initially the BPS brane is taken to be a probe
whose dynamics we determine in the non-compact non-BPS background. The
cosmology observed on the brane is of the FRW type with a scale factor
$S(\tau)$. In this mirage cosmology approach, there is no self-gravity on the
brane which cannot inflate. Self-gravity is then included by compactifying the
background space-time. The low energy effective theory below the
compactification scale is shown to be bi-metric, with matter coupling to a
different metric than the geometrically induced metric on the brane. The
geometrical scale factor on the brane is now $S(\tau) a(\tau)$ where $a(\tau)$
arises from brane self-gravity. In this non-BPS scenario the brane generically
inflates. We study the resulting inflationary scenario taking into account the
fact that the non-BPS brane eventually decays on a time-scale much larger than
the typical inflationary time-scale. After the decay, the theory ceases to be
bi-metric and COBE normalization is used to estimate the string scale which is
found to be of order $10^{14}$ GeV.
