  The wave functions of the Haldane-Rezayi paired Hall state have been
previously described by a non-unitary conformal field theory with central
charge c=-2. Moreover, a relation with the c=1 unitary Weyl fermion has been
suggested. We construct the complete unitary theory and show that it
consistently describes the edge excitations of the Haldane-Rezayi state.
Actually, we show that the unitary (c=1) and non-unitary (c=-2) theories are
related by a local map between the two sets of fields and by a suitable change
of conjugation. The unitary theory of the Haldane-Rezayi state is found to be
the same as that of the 331 paired Hall state. Furthermore, the analysis of
modular invariant partition functions shows that no alternative unitary
descriptions are possible for the Haldane-Rezayi state within the class of
rational conformal field theories with abelian current algebra. Finally, the
known c=3/2 conformal theory of the Pfaffian state is also obtained from the
331 theory by a reduction of degrees of freedom which can be physically
realized in the double-layer Hall systems.
