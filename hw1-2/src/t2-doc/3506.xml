"Integrability" of RG flows and duality in three dimensions in the 1/N
  expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  I study some classes of RG flows in three dimensions that are classically
conformal and have manifest g -> 1/g dualities. The RG flow interpolates
between known (four-fermion, Wilson-Fischer, phi_3^6) and new interacting fixed
points. These models have two remarkable properties: i) the RG flow can be
integrated for arbitrarily large values of the couplings g at each order of the
1/N expansion; ii) the duality symmetries are exact at each order of the 1/N
expansion. I integrate the RG flow explicitly to the order O(1/N), write
correlators at the leading-log level and study the interpolation between the
fixed points. I examine how duality is implemented in the regularized theory
and verified in the results of this paper.
