1/4 PBGS and Superparticle Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the worldline superfield massive superparticle actions which
preserve 1/4 portion of the underlying higher-dimensional supersymmetry. We
consider the cases of N=4/N=1 and N=8/N=2 partial breaking. In the first case
we present the corresponding Green-Schwarz type target superspace action with
one kappa supersymmetry. In the second case we find out two possibilities, one
of which is a direct generalization of the N=4/N=1 case, while another is
essentially different.
