D-brane interactions in type IIB plane-wave background
</title>

<abstract>
  The cylinder diagrams that determine the static interactions between pairs of
Dp-branes in the type IIB plane wave background are evaluated. The resulting
expressions are elegant generalizations of the flat-space formulae that depend
on the value of the Ramond-Ramond flux of the background in a non-trivial
manner. The closed-string and open-string descriptions consistently transform
into each other under a modular transformation only when each of the
interacting D-branes separately preserves half the supersymmetries. These
results are derived for configurations of euclidean signature
 D(p+1)-instantons but also generalize to lorentzian signature Dp-branes.
