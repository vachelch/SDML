Casimir energy of massive MIT fermions in a Bohm-Aharonov background
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effect of a background flux string on the vacuum energy of
massive Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions confined to a finite spatial region
through MIT boundary conditions. We treat two admissible self-adjoint
extensions of the Hamiltonian and compare the results. In particular, for one
of these extensions, the Casimir energy turns out to be discontinuous at
integer values of the flux.
