Spectral stochastic processes arising in quantum mechanical models with
  a non-L2 ground state

<abstract>
  A functional integral representation is given for a large class of quantum
mechanical models with a non--L2 ground state. As a prototype the particle in a
periodic potential is discussed: a unique ground state is shown to exist as a
state on the Weyl algebra, and a functional measure (spectral stochastic
process) is constructed on trajectories taking values in the spectrum of the
maximal abelian subalgebra of the Weyl algebra isomorphic to the algebra of
almost periodic functions. The thermodynamical limit of the finite volume
functional integrals for such models is discussed, and the superselection
sectors associated to an observable subalgebra of the Weyl algebra are
described in terms of boundary conditions and/or topological terms in the
finite volume measures.
