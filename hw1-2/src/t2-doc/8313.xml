Equivalence of renormalization with self-adjoint extension in Green's
  function formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  Energy-dependent Green's functions for the two and three dimensional
$\delta$-function plus harmonic oscillator potential systems are derived by
incorporating the renormalization and the self-adjoint extension into the
Green's function formalism, respectively. It is shown that both methods yield
an identical Green's function if a certain relation between the self-adjoint
extension parameter and the renormalized coupling constant is imposed.
