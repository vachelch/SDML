The entropy of near-extreme N=2 black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an explicit form of the classical entropy for four-dimensional static
near-BPS-saturated black holes of generic N=2 superstring vacua. The expression
is obtained by determining the leading corrections in the non-extremality
parameter to the corresponding BPS-saturated black hole solutions. These
classical results are quantitatively compared with the microscopic leading
order corrections to the microscopic result of Maldacena Strominger and Witten
for N=2 BPS-saturated black holes.
