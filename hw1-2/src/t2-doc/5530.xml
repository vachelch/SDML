Inequalities for trace anomalies, length of the RG flow, distance
  between the fixed points and irreversibility
</title>

  I argue that in quantum field theory: i) the scheme-invariant area Delta(a')
of the graph of the effective beta function between the fixed points defines
the length of the RG flow; ii) the minimum of Delta(a') in the space of flows
connecting the same UV and IR fixed points defines the (oriented) distance
between the fixed points; iii) in even dimensions, the distance between the
fixed points is equal to Delta(a)=a_UV-a_IR. These statements imply, in even
dimensions, the inequalities 0 =< Delta(a) =< Delta(a'), the irreversibility of
the RG flow and the inequality a =< c for free scalars and fermions (but not
vectors). I elaborate the axiomatic set-up of irreversibility, based on the
notion of oriented distance and the "oriented-triangle inequalities". I show
that these axioms imply the irreversibility of the RG flow without a global "a"
function. I argue that the RG flow is irreversible in odd dimensions (without a
global "a" function) and, in support of this, I check the axioms of
irreversibility in a class of d=3 theories where the RG flow is integrable at
each order of the large N expansion.
