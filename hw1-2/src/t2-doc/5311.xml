Flux-Confinement in Dilatonic Cosmic Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We study dilaton-electrodynamics in flat spacetime and exhibit a set of
global cosmic string like solutions in which the magnetic flux is confined.
These solutions continue to exist for a small enough dilaton mass but cease to
do so above a critcal value depending on the magnetic flux. There also exist
domain wall and Dirac monopole solutions. We discuss a mechanism whereby
magnetic monopolesmight have been confined by dilaton cosmic strings during an
epoch in the early universe during which the dilaton was massless.
