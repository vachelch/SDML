Quasi-exactly solvable problems and random matrix theory
</title>

<abstract>
  There exists an exact relationship between the quasi-exactly solvable
problems of quantum mechanics and models of square and rectangular random
complex matrices. This relationship enables one to reduce the problem of
constructing topological ($1/N$) expansions in random matrix models to the
problem of constructing semiclassical expansions for observables in
quasi-exactly solvable problems. Lie algebraic aspects of this relationship are
also discussed.
