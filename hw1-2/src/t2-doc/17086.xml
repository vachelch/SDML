PP-Wave Light-Cone Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the cubic interaction vertex and dynamically generated
supercharges in light-cone superstring field theory in the pp-wave background.
We show that these satisfy the pp-wave superalgebra at first order in string
coupling. The cubic interaction vertex and dynamical supercharges presented
here differ from the expressions previously given in the literature. Using this
vertex we compute various string theory three-point functions and comment on
their relation to gauge theory in the BMN limit.
