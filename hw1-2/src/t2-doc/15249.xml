Stable non-BPS states in string theory: a pedagogical review
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a pedagogical review of the stable non-BPS states in string theory
which have recently attracted some attention in the literature. In particular,
following the analysis of A. Sen, we discuss in detail the case of the stable
non-BPS D-particle of Type I theory whose existence is predicted (and required)
by the heterotic/Type I duality. We show that this D-particle originates from
an unstable bound state formed by a D1/anti-D1 pair of Type IIB in which the
tachyon field acquires a solitonic kink configuration. The mechanism of tachyon
condensation is discussed first at a qualitative level and then with an exact
conformal field theory analysis.
