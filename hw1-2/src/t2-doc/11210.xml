  theories with generic background configurations

  In the framework of osp(1,2)-symmetric quantization of irreducible massive
gauge theories the background field method is studied for the simplest case of
a linear splitting of the gauge field into a background configuration and the
quantum fluctuations. The symmetries of that approach - including three types
of background-dependent gauge transformations - are expressed by Ward
identities. From these identities together with the equations of motion of the
auxiliary field the background dependence of the vertex functions and of the
Greens functions is determined. It is proven that the introduction of a
background field does not change the ultraviolet asymptotics of the theory.
