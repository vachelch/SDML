The Moduli Space of CP^1 Stringy Cosmic Lumps
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the low-energy dynamics of CP^1 lumps coupled to gravity, taking
into account the gravitational back-reaction of the spacetime geometry. We show
that the single lump moduli space is equipped with a three-dimensional metric,
and we derive stability bounds on the scalar coupling constant. We also derive
an expression for the multi-lump moduli space metric.
