  Path integrals have played a fundamental role in emphasizing the profound
analogies between Quantum Field Theory (QFT), and Classical as well as Quantum
Statistical Physics. Ideas coming from Statistical Physics have then led to a
deeper understanding of Quantum Field Theory and open the way for a wealth of
non-perturbative methods. Conversely QFT methods are become essential for the
description of the phase transitions and critical phenomena beyond mean field
theory. This is the point we want to illustrate here. We therefore review the
methods, based on renormalized phi^4_3 quantum field theory and renormalization
group, which have led to an accurate determination of critical exponents of the
N-vector model, and more recently of the equation of state of the 3D Ising
model. The starting point is the perturbative expansion for RG functions or the
effective potential to the order presently available. Perturbation theory is
known to be divergent and its divergence has been related to instanton
contributions. This has allowed to characterize the large order behaviour of
perturbation series, an information that can be used to efficiently "sum" them.
Practical summation methods based on Borel transformation and conformal mapping
have been developed, leading to the most accurate results available probing
field theory in a non perturbative regime. We illustrate the methods with a
short discussion of the scaling equation of state of the 3D Ising model.
Compared to exponents its determination involves a few additional (non-trivial)
technical steps, like the use of the parametric representation, and the
order-dependent mapping.
