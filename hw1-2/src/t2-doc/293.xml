Universal features of the holographic duality: conformal anomaly and
  brane gravity trapping from 5d AdS Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the holographic conformal anomaly and brane Newton potential
when bulk is 5d AdS BH. It is shown that such anomaly is the same as in the
case of pure AdS or (asymptotically) dS bulk spaces, i.e. it is (bulk) metric
independent one. While Newton potential on the static brane in AdS BH is
different from the one in pure AdS space, the gravity trapping still occurs for
two branes system. This indicates to metric independence of gravity
localization.
