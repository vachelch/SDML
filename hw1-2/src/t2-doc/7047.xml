Vertex Operators and Matrix Elements of $U_q(su(2)_k)$ via Bosonization
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct bosonized vertex operators (VOs) and conjugate vertex operators
(CVOs) of $U_q(su(2)_k)$ for arbitrary level $k$ and representation $j\leq
k/2$. Both are obtained directly as two solutions of the defining condition of
vertex operators - namely that they intertwine $U_q(su(2)_k)$ modules. We
construct the screening charge and present a formula for the n-point function.
Specializing to $j=1/2$ we construct all VOs and CVOs explicitly. The existence
of the CVO allows us to place the calculation of the two-point function on the
same footing as $k=1$; that is, it is obtained without screening currents and
involves only a single integral from the CVO. This integral is evaluated and
the resulting function is shown to obey the q-KZ equation and to reduce simply
to both the expected $k=1$ and $q=1$ limits.
