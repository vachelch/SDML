Collapse versus Turbulence
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the solutions of the equations of motion in the gauged
(2+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger model. The contribution of
Chern-Simons gauge fields leads to a significant decrease of the critical power
of self-focusing. We also show that at appropriate boundary conditions in the
considered model there exists a regime of turbulent motions of hydrodynamic
type.
