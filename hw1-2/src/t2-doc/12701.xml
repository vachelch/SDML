Exact One-Point Function of N=1 super-Liouville Theory with Boundary
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, exact one-point functions of N=1 super-Liouville field theory
in two-dimensional space-time with appropriate boundary conditions are
presented. Exact results are derived both for the theory defined on a
pseudosphere with discrete (NS) boundary conditions and for the theory with
explicit boundary actions which preserves super conformal symmetries. We
provide various consistency checks. We also show that these one-point functions
can be related to a generalized Cardy conditions along with corresponding
modular $S$-matrices. Using this result, we conjecture the dependence of the
boundary two-point functions of the (NS) boundary operators on the boundary
parameter.
