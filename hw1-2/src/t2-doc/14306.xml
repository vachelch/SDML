Exact Symmetries realized on the Renormalized Group Flow
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that symmetries are preserved exactly along the (Wilsonian)
renormalization group flow, though the IR cutoff deforms concrete forms of the
transformations. For a gauge theory the cutoff dependent Ward-Takahashi
identity is written as the master equation in the antifield formalism: one may
read off the renormalized BRS transformation from the master equation. The
Maxwell theory is studied explicitly to see how it works. The renormalized BRS
transformation becomes non-local but keeps off-shell nilpotency. Our formalism
is applicable for a generic global symmetry. The master equation considered for
the chiral symmetry provides us with the continuum analog of the
Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the L{\" u}scher's symmetry.
