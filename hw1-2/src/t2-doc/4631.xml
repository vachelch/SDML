D-branes in String theory Melvin backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We determine the consistent D-brane configurations in type II
nonsupersymmetric Melvin Background. The D-branes are analysed from three
complementary points of view: the effective Born-Infeld action, the open string
partition function and the boundary state approach. We show the agreement of
the results obtained by the three different approaches. Among the surprising
features is the existence of supersymmetric branes, some of them having a
quasi-periodic direction. We also discuss the generalisation to backgrounds
with several magnetic fields, some of them preserving in the closed and the
open spectra some amount of supersymmetry. The case of rational magnetic flux,
equivalent to freely-acting noncompact orbifolds, is also studied. It allows
more possibilities of consistent D-brane configurations.
