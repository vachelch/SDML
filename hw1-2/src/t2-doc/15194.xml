Origin of a classical space in guantum cosmologies

<abstract>
  The influence of vector fields on the origin of a classical space in quantum
cosmologies and on the possible compactification process in multidimensional
gravity is investigated. It is shown that all general features of the
transition between classical and quantum regimes of the evolution can be
obtained within the simplest Bianchi-I model for arbitrary number of
dimensions. It is shown that the classical space appears when the horizon size
reaches the smallest of characteristic scales (the characteristic scale of
inhomogeneity or a scale associated with vector fields). In multidimensional
case the presence of vector fields completely removes the initial stage of the
compactification process which takes place in the case of vacuum models.
