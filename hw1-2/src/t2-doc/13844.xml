Matrix Description of Intersecting M5 Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Novel 3+1 dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories (with tensionless BPS
string solitons) are believed to arise when two sets of M5 branes intersect
over a 3+1 dimensional hyperplane. We derive a DLCQ description of these
theories as supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the Higgs branch of suitable 4d
N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. Our formulation allows us to determine the
scaling dimensions of certain chiral primary operators in the conformal field
theories. We also discuss general criteria for quantum mechanical DLCQ
descriptions of supersymmetric field theories (and the resulting multiplicities
and scaling dimensions of chiral primary operators).
