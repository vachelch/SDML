Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking at Two Loop in 3-d Massless Scalar
  Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  In three dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons massless scalar electrodynamics
with $ \phi^6$ coupling, the $U(1)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken at two
loop order regardless of the presence or absence of the Maxwell term.
Dimensional transmutation takes place in pure Chern-Simons scalar
electrodynamics. The beta function for the $\phi^6$ coupling is independent of
gauge couplings.
