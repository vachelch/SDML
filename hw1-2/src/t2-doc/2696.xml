A Stable Supergravity Dual of Non-supersymmetric Glue
</title>

<abstract>
  We study non-supersymmetric fermion mass and condensate deformations of the
AdS/CFT Correspondence. The 5 dimensional supergravity flows are lifted to a
complete and remarkably simple 10 dimensional background. A brane probe
analysis shows that when all the fermions have an equal mass a positive mass is
generated for all six scalar fields leaving non-supersymmetric Yang Mills
theory in the deep infra-red. We numerically determine the potential, produced
by the background, in the Schroedinger equation relevant to the study of O^++
glueballs. The potential is a bounded well, providing evidence of stability and
for a discrete, confined spectrum. The geometry can also describe the
supergravity background around an (unstable) fuzzy 5-brane.
