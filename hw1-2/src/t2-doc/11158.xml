Exact braneworld cosmology induced from bulk black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We use a new, exact approach in calculating the energy density measured by an
observer living on a brane embedded in a charged black hole spacetime. We find
that the bulk Weyl tensor gives rise to non-linear terms in the energy density
and pressure in the FRW equations for the brane. Remarkably, these take exactly
the same form as the ``unconventional'' terms found in the cosmology of branes
embedded in pure AdS, with extra matter living on the brane. Black hole driven
cosmologies have the benefit that there is no ambiguity in splitting the
braneword energy momentum into tension and additional matter. We propose a new,
enlarged relationship between the two descriptions of braneworld cosmology. We
also study the exact thermodynamics of the field theory and present a
generalised Cardy-Verlinde formula in this set up.
