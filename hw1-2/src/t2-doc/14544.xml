Superspace formulation of the Chern character of a theta-summable
  Fredholm module
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the concepts of superanalysis to present an intrinsically
supersymmetric formulation of the Chern character in entire cyclic cohomology.
We show that the cocycle condition is closely related to the invariance under
supertranslations. Using the formalism of superfields, we find a path integral
representation of the index of the generalized Dirac operator.
