A Perturbative Improvement of the Hierarchical Approximation
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a perturbative improvement of the hierarchical approximation for
gaussian models. The procedure is based on a relabeling of the momenta which
allows one to express the symmetries of the hierarchical model using a simple
multiplication group. The representations of this group are used to expand the
action. The perturbative expansion is treated as a problem of symmetry breaking
using Ward identity techniques.
