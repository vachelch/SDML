Inhomogeneous Magnetic Response in Anyon Fluid at High Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The charged anyon fluid in the presence of an externally applied constant and
homogeneous magnetic field is investigated at temperatures larger than the
energy gap ($T\gg \omega_{c}$). It is shown that the applied magnetic field
inhomogeneously penetrates the sample with a spatial periodicity depending on a
wavelength that decreases with temperature. The distribution of charges in the
($T\gg \omega_{c}$)-phase acquires a periodic spatial arrangement.
