Non abelian bosonisation in three dimensional field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a method based on the generalised St\"uckelberg prescription for
discussing bosonisation in the low energy regime of the SU(2) massive Thirring
model in 2+1 dimensions. For arbitrary values of the coupling parameter the
bosonised theory is found to be a nonabelian gauge theory whose physical sector
is explicitly obtained. In the case of vanishing coupling this gauge theory can
be identified with the SU(2) Yang-Mills Chern-Simons theory in the limit when
the Yang-Mills term vanishes. Bosonisation identities for the fermionic current
are derived.
