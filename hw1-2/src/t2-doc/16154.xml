N=1 Theories, T-duality, and AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an N=1 superconformal field theory using branes of type IIA
string theory. The IIA construction is related via T-duality to a IIB
configuration with 3-branes in a background generated by two intersecting
O7-planes and 7-branes. The IIB background can be viewed as a local piece of an
F-theory compactification previously studied by Sen in connection with the
Gimon-Polchinski orientifold. We discuss the deformations of the IIA and IIB
constructions and describe a new supersymmetric configuration with curving
D6-branes. Starting from the IIB description we find the supergravity dual of
the large N field theory and discuss the matching of operators and KK states.
The matching of non-chiral primaries exhibits some interesting new features. We
also discuss a relevant deformation of the field theory under which it flows to
a line of strongly coupled N=1 fixed points in the infrared. For these fixed
points we find a partial supergravity description.
