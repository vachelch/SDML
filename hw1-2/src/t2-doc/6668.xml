Quasi-Supersymmetry in Top Sector of the Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show the existence of quasi-supersymmetry as formulated by Nambu in the
top-sector of the standard model. We present the explicit form of the
quasi-supersymmetric charge. We also deduce,like Nambu, a quasi supersymmetric
mass relation which is the same as suggested by Veltman.
