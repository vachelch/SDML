Holography of asymmetrically warped space-times
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the holographic dual of asymmetrically warped space-times, which are
asymptotically AdS. The self-tuning of the cosmological constant is
reinterpreted as a cancellation of the visible sector stress-energy tensor by
the contribution of a hidden CFT, charged under a spontaneously broken global
symmetry. The apparent violation of 4D causality due to bulk geodesics is
justified by considering that the CFT feels the background metric as smeared
out over a length of the order of the AdS radius.
