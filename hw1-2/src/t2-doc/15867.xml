Covariance Properties of Reflection Equation Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The reflection equations (RE) are a consistent extension of the Yang-Baxter
equations (YBE) with an addition of one element, the so-called reflection
matrix or $K$-matrix. For example, they describe the conditions for
factorizable scattering on a half line just like the YBE give the conditions
for factorizable scattering on an entire line. The YBE were generalized to
define quadratic algebras, \lq Yang-Baxter algebras\rq\ (YBA), which were used
intensively for the discussion of quantum groups. Similarly, the RE define
quadratic algebras, \lq the reflection equation algebras\rq\ (REA), which enjoy
various remarkable properties both new and inherited from the YBA. Here we
focus on the various properties of the REA, in particular, the quantum group
comodule properties, generation of a series of new solutions by composing known
solutions, the extended REA and the central elements, etc.
