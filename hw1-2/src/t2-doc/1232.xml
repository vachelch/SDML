Duality of the Dirichlet and Neumann problems in braneworld physics
</title>

<abstract>
  Braneworld effective action for two-brane model is constructed by two
different methods based respectively on the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
value problems. The equivalence of these methods is shown due to nontrivial
duality relations between special boundary operators of these two problems.
