Topological Quantum Groups, Star Products and their relations
</title>

<abstract>
  This short summary of recent developments in quantum compact groups and star
products is divided into 2 parts. In the first one we recast star products in a
more abstract form as deformations and review its recent developments. The
second part starts with a rapid presentation of standard quantum group theory
and its problems, then moves to their completion by introduction of suitable
Montel topologies well adapted to duality. Preferred deformations (by star
products and unchanged coproducts) of Hopf algebras of functions on compact
groups and their duals, are of special interest. Connection with the usual
models of quantum groups and the quantum double is then presented.
