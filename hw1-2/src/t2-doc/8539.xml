On the Algebraic Structure of Gravitational Descendants in CP(n-1) Coset
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate how specific free-field realizations of twisted N=2
supersymmetric coset models give rise to natural extensions of the ``matter''
Hilbert spaces in such a manner as to incorporate the various gravitational
excitations. In particular, we show that adopting a particular screening
prescription is equivalent to imposing the requisite equivariance condition on
cohomology. We find a simple algebraic characterization of the
$W_n$-gravitational ground ring spectra of these theories in terms of
affine-$SU(n)$ highest weights..
