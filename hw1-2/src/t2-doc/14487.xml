BRST Cohomology and Renormalizability of Quantum Gravity near Two
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the renormalizability of quantum gravity near two dimensions based
on the results obtained by a computation of the BRST-antibracket cohomology in
the space of local functionals of the fields and antifields. We justify the
assumption on the general structure of the counterterms which have been used in
the original proof of renormalizability of the quantum gravity near two
dimensions.
