D=2+1 N=2 Yang-Mills Theory From Wrapped Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We find a new solution of Type IIB supergravity which represents a collection
of D5 branes wrapped on the topologically non-trivial S^3 of the deformed
conifold geometry T^*S^3. The Type IIB solution is obtained by lifting a new
solution of D=7 SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R gauged supergravity to ten dimensions in
which SU(2)_D gauge fields in the diagonal subgroup are turned on. The
supergravity solution describes a slice of the Coulomb branch in the large N
limit of N=2 SYM in three dimensions.
