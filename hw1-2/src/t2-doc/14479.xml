Maxwell-Chern-Simons Scalar Electrodynamics at Two Loop
</title>

<abstract>
  The Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge theory with charged scalar fields is analyzed
at two loop level. The effective potential for the scalar fields is derived in
the closed form, and studied both analytically and numerically. It is shown
that the U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken in the massless scalar theory.
Dimensional transmutation takes place in the Coleman-Weinberg limit in which
the Maxwell term vanishes. We point out the subtlety in defining the pure
Chern-Simons scalar electrodynamics and show that the Coleman-Weinberg limit
must be taken after renormalization. Renormalization group analysis of the
effective potential is also given at two loop.
