Noncommutative K3 Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider deformations of a toroidal orbifold $T^4/Z_2$ and an orbifold of
quartic in $CP^3$. In the $T^4/Z_2$ case, we construct a family of
noncommutative K3 surfaces obtained via both complex and noncommutative
deformations. We do this following the line of algebraic deformation done by
Berenstein and Leigh for the Calabi-Yau threefold. We obtain 18 as the
dimension of the moduli space both in the noncommutative deformation as well as
in the complex deformation, matching the expectation from classical
consideration. In the quartic case, we construct a $4 \times 4$ matrix
representation of noncommutative K3 surface in terms of quartic variables in
$CP^3$ with a fourth root of unity. In this case, the fractionation of branes
occurs at codimension two singularities due to the presence of discrete
torsion.
