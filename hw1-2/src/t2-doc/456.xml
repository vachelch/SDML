Weyl Invariant Gonihedric Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We study quantum corrections in the earlier proposed string theory, which is
based on Weyl invariant purely extrinsic curvature action. At one-loop level it
remains Weyl invariant irrespective of the dimension D of the embedding
spacetime. To some extent the counterterms are reminiscent of the ones in pure
quantum gravity. At classical level the string tension is equal to zero and
quarks viewed as open ends of the surface are propagating freely without
interaction. We demonstrate that quantum fluctuations generate nonzero area
term (string tension).
