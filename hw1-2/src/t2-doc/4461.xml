A Naturally Small Cosmological Constant on the Brane?
</title>

<abstract>
  There appears to be no natural explanation for the cosmological constant's
small size within the framework of local relativistic field theories. We argue
that the recently-discussed framework for which the observable universe is
identified with a p-brane embedded within a higher-dimensional `bulk'
spacetime, has special properties that may help circumvent the obstacles to
this understanding. This possibility arises partly due to several unique
features of the brane proposal. These are: (1) the potential such models
introduce for partially breaking supersymmetry, (2) the possibility of having
low-energy degrees of freedom which are not observable to us because they are
physically located on a different brane, (3) the fundamental scale may be much
smaller than the Planck scale. Furthermore, although the resulting cosmological
constant in the scenarios we outline is naturally suppressed by weak coupling
constants of gravitational strength, it need not be exactly zero, raising the
possibility it could be in the range favoured by recent cosmological
observations.
