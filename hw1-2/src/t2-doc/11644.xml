Second Class Constraints in a Higher-Order Lagrangian Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the description of second-class constraints in a Lagrangian path
integral associated with a higher-order $\Delta$-operator. Based on two
conjugate higher-order $\Delta$-operators, we also propose a Lagrangian path
integral with $Sp(2)$ symmetry, and describe the corresponding system in the
presence of second-class constraints.
