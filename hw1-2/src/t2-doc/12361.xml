Realization of Global Symmetries in the Wilsonian Renormalization Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a method to solve the master equation for the Wilsonian action in
the antifield formalism. This is based on a representation theory for cutoff
dependent global symmetries along the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG)
flow. For the chiral symmetry, the master equation for the free theory yields a
continuum version of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. We construct chiral
invariant operators describing fermionic self-interactions. The use of
canonically transformed variables is shown to simplify the underlying algebraic
structure of the symmetry. We also give another non-trivial example, a
realization of SU(2) vector symmetry. Our formalism may be used for a
non-perturbative truncation of the Wilsonian action preserving global
symmetries.
