Conformal blocks for admissible representations of $SL(2)$ current
  algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  A review is presented of the recently obtained expressions for conformal
blocks for {\it admissible} representations in $SL(2)$ current algebra based on
the Wakimoto free field construction. In this realization one needs to
introduce a second screening charge, one which depends on fractional powers of
free fields. The techniques necessary to deal with these complications are
developed, and explicit general integral representations for conformal blocks
on the sphere are provided. The fusion rules are discussed and as a check it is
verified that the conformal blocks satisfy the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equations. (Talk presented by J. Rasmussen at the Leuven workshop, July 10-14
