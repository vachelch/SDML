Ghost Systems: A Vertex Algebra Point of View
</title>

<abstract>
  Fermionic and bosonic ghost systems are defined each in terms of a single
vertex algebra which admits a one-parameter family of conformal structures. The
observation that these structures are related to each other provides a simple
way to obtain character formulae for a general twisted module of a ghost
system. The U(1) symmetry and its subgroups that underly the twisted modules
also define an infinite set of invariant vertex subalgebras. Their structure is
studied in detail from a W-algebra point of view with particular emphasis on
Z_N-invariant subalgebras of the fermionic ghost system.
