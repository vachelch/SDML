The Moduli Space of N=2 SUSY QCD and Duality in N=1 SUSY QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze in detail the moduli space of vacua of N=2 SUSY QCD with n_c
colors and n_f flavors. The Coulomb branch has submanifolds with non-Abelian
gauge symmetry. The massless quarks and gluons at these vacua are smoothly
connected to the underlying elementary quarks and gluons. Upon breaking N=2 by
an N=1 preserving mass term for the adjoint field the theory flows to N=1 SUSY
QCD. Some of the massless quarks and gluons on the moduli space of the N=2
theory become the magnetic quarks and gluons of the N=1 theory. In this way we
derive the duality in N=1 SUSY QCD by identifying its crucial building
blocks---the magnetic degrees of freedom---using only semiclassical physics and
the non-renormalization theorem.
