No-interaction theorem without Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalism:
  invariant momentum on null cones
</title>

<abstract>
  In a previous paper (G.Yoneda, Proc.R.Soc.London, A445,(1994),221), we proved
the no-interaction theorem for four particles with the assumption that the
(linear and angular) momentum on space-like planes is invariant. In this paper,
we assume that the momentum on null cones is invariant and prove that there is
no interaction for four particles.
