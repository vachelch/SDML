Exact Finite Size Results on the Ising Model in 2D Curved Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an approach to statistical systems on lattices with sphere-like
topology. Focusing on the Ising model, we consider the thermodynamic limit
along a sequence of lattices which preserve the {\em fixed} large scale
geometry. The hypothesis of scaling appears to hold at criticality, pointing at
a sensible definition of the continuum limit of the model in the curved space.
