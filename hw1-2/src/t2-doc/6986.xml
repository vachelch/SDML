Hamiltonian Frenet-Serret dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian formulation of the dynamics of a relativistic particle
described by a higher-derivative action that depends both on the first and the
second Frenet-Serret curvatures is considered from a geometrical perspective.
We demonstrate how reparametrization covariant dynamical variables and their
projections onto the Frenet-Serret frame can be exploited to provide not only a
significant simplification of but also novel insights into the canonical
analysis. The constraint algebra and the Hamiltonian equations of motion are
written down and a geometrical interpretation is provided for the canonical
variables.
