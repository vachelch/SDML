Super-Weyl Invariant 2D Supergravity, Anomaly and WZ Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a candidate of anomaly and Wess Zumino action of the two
dimensional supergravity coupling with matters in a super-Weyl invariant
regularization. It is a generalization of the Weyl and the area preserving
\Diff invariant formulation of two dimensional gravity theory.
