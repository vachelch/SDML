Charge and Magnetic Flux Correlations in Chern-Simons Theory with
  Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  Charge and magnetic flux bearing operators are introduced in Chern-Simons
theory both in its pure form and when it is coupled to fermions. The magnetic
flux creation operator turns out to be the Wilson line. The euclidean
correlation functions of these operators are shown to be local and are
evaluated exactly in the pure case and through an expansion in the inverse
fermion mass whenever these are present. Physical states only occur in the
presence of fermions and consist of composite charge-magnetic flux carrying
states which are in general anyonic. The large distance behavior of the
correlation functions indicates the condensation of charge and magnetic flux.
