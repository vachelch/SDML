IR Dynamics of d=2, N=(4,4) Gauge Theories and DLCQ of "Little String
  Theories"
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the superconformal theories (SCFTs) which arise in the low-energy
limit of N=(4,4) supersymmetric gauge theories in two dimensions, primarily the
Higgs branch SCFT. By a direct field theory analysis we find a continuum of
"throat"-like states localized near the singularities of the Higgs branch. The
"throat" is similar to the "throat" found in the Coulomb branch of the same
theories, but the full superconformal field theories of the two branches are
different. A particular example is the SCFT of the R^4/Z_2 sigma model with
zero theta angle. In the application of the Higgs branch SCFTs to the DLCQ
description of "little string theories" (LSTs), the "throat" continuum is
identified with the continuum of "throat" states in the holographic description
of the LSTs. We also match the descriptions of the string interactions (in the
"throat" region) in the DLCQ and holographic descriptions of the N=(2,0) LSTs.
