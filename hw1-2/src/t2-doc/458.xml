AdS Calibrations
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new bound for the worldvolume actions of branes with a
Wess-Zumino term. For this we introduce a generalization of calibrations for
which the calibration form is not closed. We then apply our construction to
find the M-5-brane worldvolume solitons in an AdS background that saturate this
bound. We show that these worldvolume solitons are supersymmetric and that they
satisfy differential equations which generalize those of standard calibrations.
