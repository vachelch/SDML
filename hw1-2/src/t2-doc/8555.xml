Flux, Supersymmetry and M theory on 7-manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Various aspects of low energy M theory compactified to four dimensions are
considered. If the supersymmetry parameter is parallel in the unwarped metric,
then supersymmetry requires that the warp factor is trivial, the background
four-form field strength is zero and that the internal 7-manifold has $G_2$
holonomy (we assume the absence of boundaries and other impurities). A proposal
of Gukov - extended here to include M2-brane domain walls - for the
superpotential of the compactified theory is shown to yield the same result.
Finally, we make some speculative remarks concerning higher derivative
corrections and supersymmetry breaking.
