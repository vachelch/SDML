Holomorphic effective potential in general chiral superfield model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a holomorphic effective potential $W_{eff}(\Phi)$ in chiral
superfield model defined in terms of arbitrary k\"{a}hlerian potential
$K(\bar{\Phi},\Phi)$ and arbitrary chiral potential $W(\Phi)$. Such a model
naturally arises as an ingredient of low-energy limit of superstring theory and
it is called here the general chiral superfield model. Generic procedure for
calculating the chiral loop corrections to effective action is developed. We
find lower two-loop correction in the form $W^{(2)}_{eff}(\Phi)= 6/(4\pi)^4
\bar{W}^{'''2}(0){(\frac{W^{''}(\Phi)}{K^2_{\Phi\bar{\Phi}(0,\Phi)}})}^3$ where
$K_{\Phi\bar{\Phi}}(0,\Phi)=\frac{\partial^2 K(\bar{\Phi},\Phi)}
{\partial\Phi\partial\bar{\Phi}}|_{\bar{\Phi}=0}$ and $\zeta(x)$ be Riemannian
zeta-function. This correction is finite at any $K(\bar{\Phi},\Phi), W(\Phi)$.
