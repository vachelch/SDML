Supersymmetric quantization of gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a new operator quantization scheme for gauge theories in which the
dynamics of the ghost sector is described by an N=2 supersymmetry. In this
scheme no gauge condition is imposed on the gauge fields. The corresponding
path integral is explicitly Lorentz invariant and, in contrast to the BRST-BFV
path integral in the Lorentz gauge, it is free of the Gribov ambiguity, i.e.,
it is also valid in the non-perturbative domain. The formalism can therefore be
used to study the non-perturbative properties of gauge theories in the
infra-red region (gluon confinement).
