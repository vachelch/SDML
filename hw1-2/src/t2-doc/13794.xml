A General Relativistic Model for Confinement in SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we present a model of confinement based on an analogy with the
confinement mechanism of the Schwarzschild solution of general relativity.
Using recently discovered exact, Schwarzschild-like solutions of the SU(2)
Yang-Mills-Higgs equations we study the behaviour of a scalar, SU(2) charged
test particle placed in the gauge fields of this solution. We find that this
test particle is indeed confined inside the color event horizon of our
solution. Additionally it is found that this system is a composite fermion even
though there are no fundamental fermions in the original Lagrangian.
