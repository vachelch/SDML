Incidence Matrix Description of Intersecting p-brane Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  An algebraic method for a general construction of intersecting p-brane
solutions in diverse spacetime dimensions is discussed. An incidence matrix
describing configurations of electric and magnetic fields is introduced.
Intersecting p-branes are specified by solutions of a system of characteristic
algebraic equations for the incidence matrix. This set of characteristic
equations generalizes a single characteristic equation found before for a
special "flower" ansatz. The characteristic equations admit solutions only for
quantized values of scalar coupling parameters. A wide list of examples
including solutions with regular horizons and non-zero entropy in D=11 and D=10
theories is presented.
