N=1 String Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss duality between Type IIA string theory, eleven-dimensional
supergravity, and heterotic string theory in four spacetime dimensions with
$N=1$ supersymmetry. We find theories whose infrared limit is trivial at
enhanced symmetry points as well as theories with $N=1$ supersymmetry but the
field content of $N=4$ theories which flow to the $N=4$ fixed line in the
infrared.
