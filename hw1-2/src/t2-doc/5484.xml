Thermal history of the string universe
</title>

<abstract>
  Thermal history of the string universe based on the Brandenberger and Vafa's
scenario is examined. The analysis thereby provides a theoretical foundation of
the string universe scenario. Especially the picture of the initial oscillating
phase is shown to be natural from the thermodynamical point of view. A new tool
is employed to evaluate the multi state density of the string gas. This
analysis points out that the well-known functional form of the multi state
density is not applicable for the important region $T \leq T_H$, and derives a
correct form of it.
