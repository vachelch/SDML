Gauging of Flat Groups in Four Dimensional Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that N=8 spontaneously broken supergravity in four dimensions
obtained by Scherk-Schwarz generalized dimensional reduction can be obtained
from a pure four dimensional perspective by gauging a suitable electric
subgroup of E_{7,7}. Owing to the fact that there are non isomorphic choices of
maximal electric subgroups of the U-duality group their gaugings give rise to
inequivalent theories. This in particular shows that the Scherk-Schwarz
gaugings do not fall in previous classifications of possible gauged N=8
supergravities. Gauging of flat groups appear in many examples of string
compactifications in presence of brane fluxes.
