Two-dimensional Black Hole With Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  The 2D model of gravity with zweibeins $e^{a}$ and the Lorentz connection
one-form $\omega^{a}_{\ b}$ as independent gravitational variables is
considered and it is shown that the classical equations of motion are exactly
integrated in coordinate system determined by components of 2D torsion. For
some choice of integrating constant the solution is of the charged black hole
type. The conserved charge and ADM mass of the black hole are calculated.
