Prepotentials for (2,2) Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a complete solution of the constraints for two-dimensional, N=2
supergravity in N=2 superspace. We obtain explicit expressions for the
covariant derivatives in terms of the vector superfield $H^m$ and, for the two
versions of minimal (2,2) supergravity, a chiral or twisted chiral scalar
superfield $\phi$.
