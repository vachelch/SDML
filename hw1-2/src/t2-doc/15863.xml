Brane-Antibrane Systems on Calabi-Yau Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a correspondence between brane-antibrane systems and stable
triples (E_1,E_2,T), where E_1,E_2 are holomorphic vector bundles and the
tachyon T is a map between them. We demonstrate that, under the assumption of
holomorphicity, the brane-antibrane field equations reduce to a set of vortex
equations, which are equivalent to the mathematical notion of stability of the
triple. We discuss some examples and show that the theory of stable triples
suggests a new notion of BPS bound states and stability, and curious relations
between brane-antibrane configurations and wrapped branes in higher dimensions.
