Dynamical localization of gauge fields on a brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a dynamical mechanism of localization of gauge fields on a brane
in which gauge bosons are excitations of the brane itself or composites made
out of matter fields localized on the brane. The mechanism is operative for
both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. Several scalar and scalar-fermion
composite models of gauge fields are considered. The models exhibit exact gauge
invariance and therefore charge universality of gauge interactions is
automatically preserved. The mechanism is shown to be equivalent to a
modification of the Dvali, Gabadadze and Shifman scenario in which gauge bosons
have no bulk kinetic terms and only possess induced kinetic terms on the brane.
