Integrals of Motion and Quantum Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  A homological construction of integrals of motion of the classical and
quantum Toda field theories is given. Using this construction, we identify the
integrals of motion with cohomology classes of certain complexes, which are
modeled on the BGG resolutions of the associated Lie algebras and their quantum
deformations. This way we prove that all classical integrals of motion can be
quantized. For the Toda field theories associated to finite-dimensional Lie
algebras, the algebra of integrals of motions is the corresponding W-algebra.
For affine Toda field theories this algebra is a commutative subalgebra of a
W-algebra; it consists of quantum KdV hamiltonians.
