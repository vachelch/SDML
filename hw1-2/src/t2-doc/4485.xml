Long Range Forces in Quantum Gravity

<abstract>
We calculate the leading quantum and semi-classical corrections to the
Newtonian potential energy of two widely separated static masses. In this
large-distance, static limit, the quantum behaviour of the sources does not
contribute to the quantum corrections of the potential. These arise exclusively
from the propagation of massless degrees of freedom. Our one-loop result is
based on Modanese's formulation and is in disagreement with Donoghue's recent
calculation. Also, we compare and contrast the structural similarities of our
approach to scattering at ultra-high energy and large impact parameter. We
connect our approach to results from string perturbation theory.
