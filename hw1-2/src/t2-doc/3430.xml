Massive Superstring Vertex Operator in D=10 Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the pure spinor formalism for the superstring, the vertex operator for
the first massive states of the open superstring is constructed in a manifestly
super-Poincar\'e covariant manner. This vertex operator describes a massive
spin-two multiplet in terms of ten-dimensional superfields.
