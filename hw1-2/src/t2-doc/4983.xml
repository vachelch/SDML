Critical fields on the M5-brane and noncommutative open strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The M5-brane is investigated near critical field-strength. We show that this
limit on the M5-brane reduces to the noncommutative open string limit on the
D4-brane. The reduction on a two-torus leads to both the noncommutative open
string limit and the noncommutative Yang-Mills limit on the D3-brane. The
decoupled noncommutative five-brane is identified with the strong coupling
limit of the noncommutative open string theory on the D4-brane and S-duality on
the noncommutative D3-brane is identified with a modular transformation on the
five-brane. We argue that the open membrane metric defines a finite length
scale on the worldvolume of the M5-brane in the decoupling limit. This length
scale can be associated to the effective length scale of an open membrane.
