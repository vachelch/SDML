Symmetric Monopoles

<abstract>
  We discuss the spectral curves and rational maps associated with $SU(2)$
Bogomolny monopoles of arbitrary charge $k$. We describe the effect on the
rational maps of inverting monopoles in the plane with respect to which the
rational maps are defined, and discuss the monopoles invariant under such
inversion. We define the strongly centred monopoles, and show they form a
geodesic submanifold of the $k$-monopole moduli space. The space of strongly
centred $k$-monopoles invariant under the cyclic group of rotations about a
fixed axis, $C_k$, is shown to consist of several surfaces of revolution,
generalizing the two surfaces obtained by Atiyah and Hitchin in the 2-monopole
case. Geodesics on these surfaces give a novel type of $k$-monopole scattering.
We present a number of curves in $TP_1$ which we conjecture are the spectral
curves of monopoles with the symmetries of a regular solid. These conjectures
are based on analogies with Skyrmions.
