The Cosmological Constant and Warped Extra Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the behavior of a general gravitational action, including quadratic
terms in the curvature, supplemented by a compact scalar field in 4+1
dimensions. The generalized Einstein equation for this system admits solutions
which are compact in one direction and Poincare invariant in the remaining
directions. These solutions do not require any fine-tuning of the parameters in
the action---including the cosmological constant---only that they should
satisfy some mild inequalities. Some of these inequalities can be expressed in
a universal form that does not depend on the number of extra compact dimensions
when the scenario is generalized beyond 4+1 dimensions.
