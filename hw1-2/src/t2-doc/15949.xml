Holographic renormalization group and conformal anomaly for AdS_9/CFT_8
  correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  Holographic Renormalization Group (RG) in nine dimensions is considered. The
d8 holographic conformal anomaly is found. It should correspond to d8 CFT in
AdS_9/CFT_8 correspondence. The comparison of holographic and QFT anomalies in
d8 de Sitter space is done. It may give the indication for rigorous AdS_9/CFT_8
correspondence proposal.
