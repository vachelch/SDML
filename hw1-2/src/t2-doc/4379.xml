Physical nonlinear aspects of classical and quantum q-oscillators
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical limit of quantum q-oscillators suggests an interpretation of
the deformation as a way to introduce non linearity. Guided by this idea, we
considered q-fields, the partition fumction, and compute a consequence on
specific heat and second order correlation function of the q-oscillator which
may serve for experimental checks for the non linearity.
