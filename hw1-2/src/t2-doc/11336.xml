The Other Spectral Flow
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently we showed that the spectral flow acting on the N=2 twisted
topological theories gives rise to a topological algebra automorphism. Here we
point out that the untwisting of that automorphism leads to a spectral flow on
the untwisted N=2 superconformal algebra which is different from the usual one.
This "other" spectral flow does not interpolate between the chiral ring and the
antichiral ring. In particular, it maps the chiral ring into the chiral ring
and the antichiral ring into the antichiral ring. We discuss the similarities
and differences between both spectral flows. We also analyze their action on
null states.
