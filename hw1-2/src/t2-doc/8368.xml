How Noncommutative Gauge Theories Couple to Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study coupling of noncommutative gauge theories on branes to closed string
in the bulk. We derive an expression for the gauge theory operator dual to the
bulk graviton, both in bosonic string theory and superstring theory. In either
case, we find that the coupling is different from what was expected in the
literature when the graviton is polarized in the noncommutative directions. In
the case of superstring, the expression for the energy-momentum tensor is
consistent with the way the bulk metric appears in the action for the
noncommutative gauge theory. We also clarify some aspects of the correspondence
between operators in the gauge theory and boundary conditions in the dual
gravitational description.
