Electric-Magnetic Duality Rotations and Invariance of Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  For D=4 theories of a single U(1) gauge field strength coupled to gravity and
matters, we show that the electric-magnetic duality can be formulated as an
invariance of the actions. The symmetry is associated with duality rotation
acting directly on the gauge field. The rotation is constructed in flat space,
and an extension to curved spaces is also given. It is non-local and
non-covariant, yet generates off-shell extended transformation of the field
strength. The algebraic condition of Gaillard and Zumino turns out to be a
necessary and sufficient condition for the invariance of actions. It may be
used as a guiding principle in constructing self-dual actions in string and
field theories.
