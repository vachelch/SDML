Genuine Dyons in Born-Infeld Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Study of magnetic monopoles in the original version of Born-Infeld (BI)
electrodynamics is performed. It then is realized that interesting new physics
emerge and they include exotic behavior of radial electric monopole field such
as its regularity as $r\to 0$ and its changing behavior with the absence or
presence of the radial magnetic monopole field. This last point has been
interpreted as the manifestation of the existence of point-like dyons in
abelian BI theory. Two pieces of clear evidences in favor of this dyon
interpretation are provided. It is also demonstrated that despite these unique
features having no analogues in standard Maxwell theory, the cherished Dirac
quantisation condition remains unchanged. Lastly, comments are given concerning
that dyons found here in the original version of BI electrodynamics should be
distinguished from the ones with the same name or BIons being studied in the
recent literature on D-brane physics.
