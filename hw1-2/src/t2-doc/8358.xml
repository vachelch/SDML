Quantum Field Theories on Null Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the behaviour of quantum field theories defined on a surface $S$ as
it tends to a null surface $S_n$. In the case of a real, free scalar field
theory the above limiting procedure reduces the system to one with a finite
number of degrees of freedom. This system is shown to admit a one parameter
family of inequivalent quantizations. A duality symmetry present in the model
can be used to remove the quantum ambiguity at the self-dual point . In the
case of the non-linear $\sigma$-model with the Wess-Zumino-Witten term a
similar limiting behaviour is obtained. The quantization ambiguity in this case
however cannot be removed by any means.
