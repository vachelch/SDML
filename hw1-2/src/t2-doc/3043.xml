Anomalous Magnetic Moment of Anyons
</title>

<abstract>
  The anomalous magnetic moment of anyons is calculated to leading order in a
1/N expansion. It is shown that the gyromagnetic ratio g remains 2 to the
leading order in 1/N. This result strongly supports that obtained in
\cite{poly}, namely that g=2 is in fact exact.
