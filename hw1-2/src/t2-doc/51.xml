Symplectic connections, Noncommutative Yang Mills theory and
  Supermembranes
</title>

<abstract>
  In built noncommutativity of supermembranes with central charges in eleven
dimensions is disclosed. This result is used to construct an action for a
noncommutative supermembrane where interesting topological terms appear. In
order to do so, we first set up a global formulation for noncommutative Yang
Mills theory over general symplectic manifolds. We make the above constructions
following a pure geometrical procedure using the concept of connections over
Weyl algebra bundles on symplectic manifolds. The relation between
noncommutative and ordinary supermembrane actions is discussed.
