Regular Poisson structures on massive non-rotating BTZ black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We revisit the non-rotating massive BTZ black hole within a pseudo-Riemannian
symmetric space context. Using classical symmetric space techniques we find
that every such space intrinsically carries a regular Poisson structure whose
symplectic leaves are para-hermitian symmetric surfaces. We also obtain a
global expression of the metric yielding a dynamical description of the black
hole from its initial to its final singularity.
