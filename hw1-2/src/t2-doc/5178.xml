The Fate of the Radion in Models with Metastable Graviton
</title>

<abstract>
  We clarify some general issues in models where gravity is localized at
intermediate distances. We introduce the radion mode, which is usually
neglected, and we point out that its role in the model is crucial. We show that
the brane bending effects discussed in the literature can be obtained in a
formalism where the physical origin is manifest. The model violates positivity
of energy due to a negative tension brane, which induces a negative kinetic
term for the radion. The very same effect that violates positivity is
responsible for the recovery of conventional Einstein gravity at intermediate
distances.
