Hidden Virasoro Symmetry of (Soliton Solutions of) the Sine Gordon
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a construction of a Virasoro symmetry of the sine-Gordon (SG)
theory. It is a dynamical one and has nothing to do with the space-time
Virasoro symmetry of 2D CFT. Although it is clear how it can be realized
dyrectly in the SG field theory, we are rather concerned here with the
corresponding N-soliton solutions. We present explicit expressions for their
infinithesimal transformations and show that they are local in this case. Some
preliminary stages about the quantization of the classical results presented in
this paper are also given.
