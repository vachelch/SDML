Entropy and Topology for Gravitational Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work a relation between topology and thermodynamical features of
gravitational instantons is shown. The expression for the Euler characteristic,
through the Gauss-Bonnet integral, and the one for the entropy of gravitational
instantons are proposed in a form that makes the relation between them
self-evident. A new formulation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, where the
entropy and the Euler characteristic are related by $S=\chi A/8$, is obtained.
This formula provides the correct results for a wide class of gravitational
instantons described by both spherically and axially symmetric metrics.
