Duality in deformed coset fermionic models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the $SU(2)_k/U(1)$-parafermion model perturbed by its first thermal
operator. By formulating the theory in terms of a (perturbed) fermionic coset
model we show that the model is equivalent to interacting WZW fields modulo
free fields. In this scheme, the order and disorder operators of the $Z_k$
parafermion theory are constructed as gauge invariant composites. We find that
the theory presents a duality symmetry that interchanges the roles of the spin
and dual spin operators. For two particular values of the coupling constant we
find that the theory recovers conformal invariance and the gauge symmetry is
enlarged. We also find a novel self-dual point.
