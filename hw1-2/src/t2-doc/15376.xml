Evaporation of Schwarzschild Black Holes in Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, in collaboration with Susskind, we proposed a model of
Schwarzschild black holes in Matrix theory. A large Schwarzschild black hole is
described by a metastable bound state of a large number of D0-branes which are
held together by a background, whose structure has so far been understood only
in 8 and 11 dimensions. The Hawking radiation proceeds by emission of small
clusters of D0-branes. We estimate the Hawking rate in the Matrix theory model
of Schwarzschild black holes and find agreement with the semiclassical rate up
to an undetermined numerical coefficient of order 1.
