Asymptotic Solutions to the Quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equation
  and Bethe Vectors
</title>

<abstract>
  Asymptotic solutions to the quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation
associated with $\frak{gl}_{N+1}$ are constructed. The leading term of an
asymptotic solution is the Bethe vector -- an eigenvector of the
transfer-matrix of a quantum spin chain model. We show that the norm of the
Bethe vector is equal to the product of the Hessian of a suitable function and
an explicitly written rational function. This formula is an analogue of the
Gaudin-Korepin formula for the norm of the Bethe vector. It is shown that,
generically, the Bethe vectors form a base for the $\frak{gl}_2$ case.
