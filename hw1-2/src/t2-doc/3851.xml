The Collective Field Theory of a Singular Supersymmetric Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The supersymmetric collective field theory with the potential $v'(x)=\omega
x-{\eta\over x}$ is studied, motivated by the matrix model proposed by Jevicki
and Yoneya to describe two dimensional string theory in a black hole
background. Consistency with supersymmetry enforces a two band solution. A
supersymmetric classical configuration is found, and interpreted in terms of
the density of zeros of certain Laguerre polynomials. The spectrum of the model
is then studied and is seen to correspond to a massless scalar and a majorana
fermion. The $x$ space eigenfunctions are constructed and expressed in terms of
Chebyshev polynomials. Higher order interactions are also discussed.
