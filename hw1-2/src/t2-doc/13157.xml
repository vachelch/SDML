From p-branes to fluxbranes and back
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we study aspects of the interplay between fluxbranes and
p-branes. We describe how a fluxbrane can be physically realized as a limit of
a brane-antibrane configuration, in a manner similar to the way a uniform
electric field appears in between the plates of a capacitor. We also study the
evolution of a fluxbrane after nucleation of p-branes. We find that
Kaluza-Klein fluxbranes do relax by forming brane-antibrane pairs or spherical
branes, but we also find that for fluxtubes with dilaton coupling in a
different range, the field strength does not relax, instead it becomes stronger
after each nucleation bounce. We speculate on a possible runaway instability of
such fluxtubes an an eventual breakdown of their classical description.
