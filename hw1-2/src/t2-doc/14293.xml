OM Theory in Diverse Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Open string theories can be decoupled from closed strings and gravity by
scaling to the critical electric field. We propose dual descriptions for the
strong coupling limit of these NCOS (Non-Commutative Open String) theories in
six or fewer spacetime dimensions. In particular, we conjecture that the
five-dimensionsal NCOS theory at strong coupling, is a theory of light Open
Membranes (OM), decoupled from gravity, on an M5-brane with a near-critical
three-form field strength. The relation of OM theory to NCOS theories resembles
that of M theory to Type II closed string theories. In two dimensions we
conjecture that supersymmetric U($n$) gauge theory with a unit of electric flux
is dual to the NCOS theory with string coupling $1 \over n$. A construction
based on NS5-branes leads to new theories in six dimensions generalising the
little string theory. A web of dualities relates all the above theories when
they are compactified on tori.
