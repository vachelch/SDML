4d Conformal Field Theories and Strings on Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose correspondences between 4d quantum field theories with N=2,1,0
(super)conformal invariance and Type IIB string theory on various orbifolds. We
argue using the spacetime string theory, and check using the beta functions
(exactly for N=2,1 and so far at 1-loop for the gauge couplings in the N=0
case), that these theories have conformal fixed lines. The latter case
potentially gives well-defined non-supersymmetric vacua of string theory, with
a mechanism for making the curvature and cosmological constant small at
nontrivial string coupling. We suggest a correspondence between
nonsupersymmetric conformal fixed lines and nonsupersymmetric string vacua with
vanishing vacuum energy.
