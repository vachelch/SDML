Spectrum Generating Algebra and No-Ghost Theorem for Fermionic Massive
  String
</title>

<abstract>
  The covariant operator quantization of the ordinary free spinning BDH string
modified by adding the supersymmetric Liouville sector is analysed in the even
target space dimensions $d=2,4,6,8$. The spectrum generating algebra for this
model is constructed and a general version of the no-ghost theorem is proven. A
counterpart of the GSO projection leads to a family of tachyon free unitary
free string theories. One of these models is equivalent to the non-critical
Rammond-Neveu-Schwarz spinning string truncated in the Neveu-Schwarz sector to
the tachyon free eigenspace of the fermion parity operator.
