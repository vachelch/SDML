Stability of Vacua and Domain Walls in Supergravity and Superstring
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We address the possibility of false vacuum decay in $N=1$ supergravity
theories, including those corresponding to superstring vacua. By establishing a
Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy density stored in the domain wall of the
$O(4)$ invariant bubble, we show that supersymmetric vacua remain absolutely
stable against false vacuum decay into another supersymmetric vacuum, including
those from a Minkowski to an anti-deSitter (AdS) one. As a consequence, there
are no compact static spherical domain walls, while on the other hand there
exist planar domain walls interpolating between non-degenerate supersymmetric
vacua, e.g. between Minkowski (topology $\Re^{4}$) and AdS (topology
$S^{1}(time) \times \Re^{3}(space)$) vacua. (Talk presented at the XXVI
