Large $N$ Matrix Models and $q$-Deformed Quantum Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently it was shown that an asymptotic behaviour of $SU(N)$ gauge theory
for large $N$ is described by q-deformed quantum field. The master fields for
large N theories satisfy to standard equations of relativistic field theory but
fields satisfy $q$-deformed commutation relations with $q=0$. These commutation
relations are realized in the Boltzmannian Fock space. The master field for
gauge theory does not take values in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra however
there is a non-Abelian gauge symmetry. The gauge master field for a subclass of
planar diagrams, so called half-planar diagrams, is also considered. A
recursive set of master fields summing up a matreoshka of 2-particles reducible
planar diagrams is briefly described.
