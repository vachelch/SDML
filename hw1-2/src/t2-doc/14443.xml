Coordinate-free quantization of first-class constrained systems
</title>

<abstract>
  The coordinate-free formulation of canonical quantization, achieved by a
flat-space Brownian motion regularization of phase-space path integrals, is
extended to a special class of closed first-class constrained systems that is
broad enough to include Yang-Mills type theories with an arbitrary compact
gauge group. Central to this extension are the use of coherent state path
integrals and of Lagrange multiplier integrations that engender projection
operators onto the subspace of gauge invariant states.
