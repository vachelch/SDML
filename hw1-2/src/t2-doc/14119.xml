Seiberg-Witten Systems and Whitham Hierarchies: a Short Review
</title>

<abstract>
  We briefly review the Whitham hierarchies and their applications to
integrable systems of the Seiberg-Witten type. The simplest example of the N=2
supersymmetric SU(2) pure gauge theory is considered in detail and the
corresponding Whitham solutions are found explicitely.
