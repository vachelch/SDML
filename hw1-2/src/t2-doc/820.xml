Yukawa couplings in intersecting D-brane models
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the Yukawa couplings among chiral fields in toroidal Type II
compactifications with wrapping D6-branes intersecting at angles. Those models
can yield realistic standard model spectrum living at the intersections. The
Yukawa couplings depend both on the Kahler and open string moduli but not on
the complex structure. They arise from worldsheet instanton corrections and are
found to be given by products of complex Jacobi theta functions with
characteristics. The Yukawa couplings for a particular intersecting brane
configuration yielding the chiral spectrum of the MSSM are computed as an
example. We also show how our methods can be extended to compute Yukawa
couplings on certain classes of elliptically fibered CY manifolds which are
mirror to complex cones over del Pezzo surfaces. We find that the Yukawa
couplings in intersecting D6-brane models have a mathematical interpretation in
the context of homological mirror symmetry. In particular, the computation of
such Yukawa couplings is related to the construction of Fukaya's category in a
generic symplectic manifold.
