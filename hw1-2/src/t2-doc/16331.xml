A Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem for Nonlinear Response
  Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  A nonlinear generalization of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) for
the n-point Green functions and the amputated 1PI vertex functions at finite
temperature is derived in the framework of the Closed Time Path formalism. We
verify that this generalized FDT coincides with known results for n=2 and 3.
New explicit relations among the 4-point nonlinear response and correlation
(fluctuation) functions are presented.
