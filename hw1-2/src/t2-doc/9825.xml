Non-perturbative 2d quantum gravity and hamiltonians unbounded from
  below
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the stochastic stabilization provides both the weak coupling
genus expansion and a strong coupling expansion of 2d quantum gravity. The
double scaling limit is described by a hamiltonian which is unbounded from
below, but which has a discrete spectrum.
