*-Products on Quantum Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we present explicit formulas for the *-product on quantum
spaces which are of particular importance in physics, i.e., the q-deformed
Minkowski space and the q-deformed Euclidean space in 3 and 4 dimensions,
respectively. Our formulas are complete and formulated using the deformation
parameter q. In addition, we worked out an expansion in powers of h=lnq up to
second order, for all considered cases.
