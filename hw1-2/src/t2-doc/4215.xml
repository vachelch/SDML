Minimal Length Uncertainty Relation and Ultraviolet Regularisation
</title>

<abstract>
  Studies in string theory and quantum gravity suggest the existence of a
finite lower limit $\Delta x_0$ to the possible resolution of distances, at the
latest on the scale of the Planck length of $10^{-35}m$. Within the framework
of the euclidean path integral we explicitly show ultraviolet regularisation in
field theory through this short distance structure. Both rotation and
translation invariance can be preserved. An example geometry is studied in
detail.
