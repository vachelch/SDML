NDIM achievements: Massive, Arbitrary tensor rank and N-loop insertions
  in Feynman integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  One of the main difficulties in studying Quantum Field Theory, in the
perturbative regime, is the calculation of D-dimensional Feynman integrals. In
general, one introduces the so-called Feynman parameters and associated with
them the cumbersome parametric integrals. Solving these integrals beyond the
one-loop level can be a difficult task. Negative dimensional integration method
(\ndim{}) is a technique whereby such problem is dramatically reduced. In this
work we present the calculation of two-loop integrals in three diferent cases:
scalar ones with three diferent masses, massless with arbitrary tensor rank,
with N-insertions of a 2-loop diagram.
