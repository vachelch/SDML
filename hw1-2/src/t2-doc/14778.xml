Supersymmetry algebras and Lorentz invariance for d=10 Super Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider ways in which conventional supersymmetry can be embedded in the
set of more general fermionic transformations proposed recently [\Ref{B}] as a
framework in which to study $d=10$ super Yang-Mills. Solutions are exhibited
which involve closed algebras of various numbers of supersymmetries together
with their invariance groups: nine supersymmetries with $\GT {\times}\SO (1,1)$
invariance; eight supersymmetries with $\SO (7){\times}\SO (1,1)$ invariance;
four supersymmetries with $\SO (3,1){\times}\U (3)$ invariance. We recover in
this manner all previously known ways of adding finite numbers of bosonic
auxiliary fields so as to partially close the $d=10$ superalgebra. A crucial
feature of these solutions is that the auxiliary fields transform non-trivially
under the residual Lorentz symmetry, even though they are originally introduced
as Lorentz scalars.
