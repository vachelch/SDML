String Kaluza-Klein cosmologies with RR-fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct 4-dimensional cosmological FRW--models by compactifying a black
5-brane solution of type IIB supergravity, which carries both magnetic
NS-NS-charge and RR-charge. The influence of nontrivial RR-fields on the
dynamics of the cosmological models is investigated.
