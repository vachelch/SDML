Note on W3 Realizations of the Bosonic String
</title>

<abstract>
  In order to investigate to what extent string theories are different vacua of
a general string theory (the ``universal string"), we discuss realizations of
the bosonic string as particular background of certain types of $W$-strings.
Our discussions include linearized $W_3^{lin}$, non-critical $W_3$, linearized
$W_3^{(2)lin}$ and critical $W_3^{(2)}$ realizations of the bosonic string.
