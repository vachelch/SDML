Higher spin constraints and the super $( W_{\infty\over 2}\oplus
  W_{{1+\infty}\over 2})$ algebra in the super eigenvalue model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the partition function of the super eigenvalue model satisfies
an infinite set of constraints with even spins $s=4,6,\cdots,\infty$. These
constraints are associated with half of the bosonic generators of the super
$\left( W_{\infty \over 2}\oplus W_{{1+\infty}\over 2}\right)$ algebra. The
simplest constraint $(s=4)$ is shown to be reducible to the super Virasoro
constraints, previously used to construct the model. All results hold for
finite $N$.
