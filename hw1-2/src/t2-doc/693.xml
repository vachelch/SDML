Solitons in Seiberg-Witten Theory and D-branes in the Derived Category
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the "geometric engineering" limit of a type II string on a
suitable Calabi-Yau threefold to obtain an N=2 pure SU(2) gauge theory. The
derived category picture together with Pi-stability of B-branes beautifully
reproduces the known spectrum of BPS solitons in this case in a very explicit
way. Much of the analysis is particularly easy since it can be reduced to
questions about the derived category of CP1.
