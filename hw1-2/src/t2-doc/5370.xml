Superstring Vertex Operators in an AdS_5 x S^5 Background
</title>

<abstract>
  A quantizable action has recently been proposed for the superstring in an
AdS_5 x S^5 background with Ramond-Ramond flux. In this paper, we construct
physical vertex operators corresponding to on-shell fluctuations around the
AdS_5 x S^5 background. The structure of these AdS_5 x S^5 vertex operators
closely resembles the structure of the massless vertex operators in a flat
background.
