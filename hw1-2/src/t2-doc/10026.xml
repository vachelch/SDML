Soliton equations and the zero curvature condition in noncommutative
  geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  Familiar nonlinear and in particular soliton equations arise as zero
curvature conditions for GL(1,R) connections with noncommutative differential
calculi. The Burgers equation is formulated in this way and the Cole-Hopf
transformation for it attains the interpretation of a transformation of the
connection to a pure gauge in this mathematical framework. The KdV, modified
KdV equation and the Miura transformation are obtained jointly in a similar
setting and a rather straightforward generalization leads to the KP and a
modified KP equation.
 Furthermore, a differential calculus associated with the Boussinesq equation
is derived from the KP calculus.
