Curved branes from string dualities
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a simple method for generating new string solutions for which the
brane worldvolume is a curved space. As a starting point we use solutions with
NS-NS charges combined with 2-d CFT's representing different parts of
space-time. We illustrate our method with many examples, some of which are
associated with conformally invariant sigma models. Using U-duality, we also
obtain supergravity solutions with RR charges which can be interpreted as
D-branes with non-trivial worldvolume geometry. In particular, we discuss the
case of a D5-brane wrapped on AdS_3 x S^3, a solution interpolating between
AdS_3 x S^3 x R^5 and AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x R, and a D3-brane wrapped over S^3 x
R or AdS_2 x S^2. Another class of solutions we discuss involves NS5-branes
intersecting over a 3-space and NS5-branes intersecting over a line. These
solutions are similar to D7-brane or cosmic string backgrounds.
