Bound States at Threshold in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a general method that allows to detect the existence of
normalizable ground states in supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems with
non-Fredholm spectrum. We apply our method to show the existence of bound
states at threshold in two important cases: 1) the quantum mechanical system
describing H-monopoles; 2) the quantum mechanics of D0 branes.
