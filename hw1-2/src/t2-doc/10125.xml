The Ward Identity from the Background Field Dependence of the Effective
  Action
</title>

<abstract>
  The dependence of the effective action for gauge theories on the background
field obeys an exact identity. We argue that for Abelian theories the Ward
identity follows from the more general background field identity. This
observation is particularly relevant for the anomalous Ward identity valid for
gauge theories with an effective infrared cutoff as used for flow equations.
