Torsion D-Branes in Nongeometrical Phases
</title>

<abstract>
  In a geometrical background, D-brane charge is classified by topological
K-theory. The corresponding classification of D-brane charge in an arbitrary,
nongeometrical, compactification is still a mystery. We study D-branes on
non-simply-connected Calabi-Yau 3-folds, with particular interest in the
D-branes whose charges are torsion elements of the K-theory. We argue that we
can follow the D-brane charge through the nongeometrical regions of the Kahler
moduli space and, as evidence, explicitly construct torsion D-branes at the
Gepner point in some examples. In one of our examples, the Gepner theory is a
nonabelian orbifold of a tensor product of minimal models, and this somewhat
exotic situation seems to be essential to the physics.
