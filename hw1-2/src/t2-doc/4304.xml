Effective Field Theory, Black Holes, and the Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  Bekenstein has proposed the bound S < pi M_P^2 L^2 on the total entropy S in
a volume L^3. This non-extensive scaling suggests that quantum field theory
breaks down in large volume. To reconcile this breakdown with the success of
local quantum field theory in describing observed particle phenomenology, we
propose a relationship between UV and IR cutoffs such that an effective field
theory should be a good description of Nature. We discuss implications for the
cosmological constant problem. We find a limitation on the accuracy which can
be achieved by conventional effective field theory: for example, the minimal
correction to (g-2) for the electron from the constrained IR and UV cutoffs is
larger than the contribution from the top quark.
