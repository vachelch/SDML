Note on Open String/D-brane System and Noncommutative Soliton
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a summary of a series of papers hep-th/9910263,0005283,0010066
written with B. Chen, T. Matsuo and K. Murakami on a p-p', (p<p^{\prime}) open
string with B_{ij} field, which has led us to the explicit identification of
the Dp-brane with the noncommutative projector soliton via the gaussian damping
factor. A lecture given at Summer Institute 2000, FujiYoshida, Yamanashi,
Japan, at August 7-14, 2000.
