Scalar Field Corrections to AdS_4 Gravity from Higher Spin Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the complete contribution to the stress-energy tensor in the
minimal bosonic higher spin theory in D=4 that is quadratic in the scalar
field. We find arbitrarily high derivative terms, and that the total sign of
the stress-energy tensor depends on the parity of the scalar field.
