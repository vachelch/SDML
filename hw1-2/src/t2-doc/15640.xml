Particle description of zero energy vacuum. I. Virtual particles

  First the "frame problem" is sketched: the motion of an isolated particle
obeys a simple law in galilean frames, but how does the galilean character of
the frame manifest itself at the place of the particle? A description of vacuum
as a system of virtual particles will help to answer this question. For future
application to such a description, the notion of global particle is defined and
studied. To this end, a systematic use of the Fourier transformation on the
Poincare group is needed. The state of a system of n free particles is
represented by a statistical operator W, which defines an operator-valued
measure on the n-th power of the dual of the Poincare group. The inverse
Fourier-Stieltjes transform of that measure is called the characteristic
function of the system; it is a function on the n-th power of the Poincare
group. The main notion is that of global characteristic function: it is the
restriction of the characteristic function to the diagonal subgroup ; it
represents the state of the system, considered as a single particle. The main
properties of characteristic functions, and particularly of global
characteristic functions, are studied. A mathematical Appendix defines two
functional spaces involved.
