Emergence of Skyrme crystal in Gross-Neveu and 't Hooft models at finite
  density
</title>

<abstract>
  We study two-dimensional, large $N$ field theoretic models (Gross-Neveu
model, 't Hooft model) at finite baryon density near the chiral limit. The same
mechanism which leads to massless baryons in these models induces a breakdown
of translational invariance at any finite density. In the chiral limit baryonic
matter is characterized by a spatially varying chiral angle with a wave number
depending only on the density. For small bare quark masses a sine-Gordon kink
chain is obtained which may be regarded as simplest realization of the Skyrme
crystal for nuclear matter. Characteristic differences between confining and
non-confining models are pointed out.
