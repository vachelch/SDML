The Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for quadratic algebras of Koszul type
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we discuss a generalization of the classica PBW-theorem to the
case of Koszul algebras. Our result is a slight generalization of that obtained
by A.Polischuk and L.Positselsky, but the proof is different and uses
deformation theory.
