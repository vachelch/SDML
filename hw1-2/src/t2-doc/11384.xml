Topology of the gauge-invariant gauge field in two-color QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate solutions to a nonlinear integral equation which has a central
role in implementing the non-Abelian Gauss's Law and in constructing
gauge-invariant quark and gluon fields. Here we concern ourselves with
solutions to this same equation that are not operator-valued, but are functions
of spatial variables and carry spatial and SU(2) indices. We obtain an
expression for the gauge-invariant gauge field in two-color QCD, define an
index that we will refer to as the ``winding number'' that characterizes it,
and show that this winding number is invariant to a small gauge transformation
of the gauge field on which our construction of the gauge-invariant gauge field
is based. We discuss the role of this gauge field in determining the winding
number of the gauge-invariant gauge field. We also show that when the winding
number of the gauge field is an integer $\ell{\neq}0$, the gauge-invariant
gauge field manifests winding numbers that are not integers, and are
half-integers only when $\ell=0$.
