A nonsupersymmetric matrix orbifold

<abstract>
  We construct the matrix description for a twisted version of the IIA string
theory on S^1 with fermions antiperiodic around a spatial circle. The result is
a 2+1-dimensional U(N) x U(N) nonsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with
fermionic matter transforming in the (N,Nbar). The two U(N)'s are exchanged if
one goes around a twisted circle of the worldvolume. Relations with Type 0
theories are explored and we find Type 0 matrix string limits of our gauge
theory. We argue however that most of these results are falsified by the
absence of SUSY nonrenormalization theorems and that the models do not in fact
have a sensible Lorentz invariant space time interpretation.
