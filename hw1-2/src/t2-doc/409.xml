Planar QED in Magnetic or Electric Solitonic Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the resolvent technique for computing the effective action in
planar QED. For static magnetic backgrounds the effective action yields (minus)
the effective energy of the fermions, while for electric backgrounds the
imaginary part of the effective action gives (half) the probability of
fermion-antifermion pair creation. For some special `solitonic' background
profiles, these effective actions can be computed exactly.
