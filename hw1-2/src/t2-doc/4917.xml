Monopoles in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A realization of E_{n+1} monopoles in string theory is given. The NS five
brane stuck to an Orientifold eight plane is identified as the 't Hooft
Polyakov monopole. Correspondingly, the moduli space of many such NS branes is
identified with the moduli space of SU(2) monopoles. These monopoles transform
in the spinor representation of an SO(2n) gauge group when n D8 branes are
stacked upon the orientifold plane. This leads to a realization of E_{n+1}
monopole moduli spaces. Charge conservation leads to a dynamical effect which
does not allow the NS branes to leave the orientifold plane. This suggests that
the monopole moduli space is smooth for n<8. Odd n>8 obeys a similar condition.
Using a chain of dualities, we also connect our system to an Heterotic
background with Kaluza-Klein monopoles.
