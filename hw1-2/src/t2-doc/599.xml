On the quantum matrix string
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the behavior of matrix string theory in the strong coupling region,
where it is expected to reduce to discrete light-cone type IIA superstring. In
the large $N$ limit, the reduction corresponds to the double-dimensional
reduction from wrapped supermembranes on $R^{10}\times S^1$ to type IIA
superstrings on $R^{10}$ in the light-cone gauge, which is shown classically,
however it is not obvious quantum mechanically. We analyze the problem in
matrix string theory by using the strong coupling ($1/g$) expansion. We find
that the quantum corrections do not cancel out at $\mathcal{O}(1/g^2)$.
Detailed calculations can be seen in Ref.\cite{UY}.
