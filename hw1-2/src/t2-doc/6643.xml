Spectrum of Schroedinger field in a noncommutative magnetic monopole
</title>

<abstract>
  The energy spectrum of a nonrelativistic particle on a noncommutative sphere
in the presence of a magnetic monopole field is calculated. The system is
treated in the field theory language, in which the one-particle sector of a
charged Schroedinger field coupled to a noncommutative U(1) gauge field is
identified. It is shown that the Hamiltonian is essentially the angular
momentum squared of the particle, but with a nontrivial scaling factor
appearing, in agreement with the first-quantized canonical treatment of the
problem. Monopole quantization is recovered and identified as the quantization
of a commutative Seiberg-Witten mapped monopole field.
