Dual Confinement of Grand Unified Monopoles?
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple formal computation, and a variation on an old thought experiment,
both indicate that QCD with light quarks may confine fundamental color magnetic
charges, giving an explicit as well as elegant resolution to the `global color'
paradox, strengthening Vachaspati's SU(5) electric-magnetic duality, opening
new lines of inquiry for monopoles in cosmology, and suggesting a class of
geometrically large QCD excitations -- loops of Z(3) color magnetic flux
entwined with light-quark current. The proposal may be directly testable in
lattice gauge theory or supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Recent results in
deeply-inelastic electron scattering, and future experiments both there and in
high-energy collisions of nuclei, could give evidence on the existence of Z(3)
loops. If confirmed, they would represent a consistent realization of the bold
concept underlying the Slansky-Goldman-Shaw `glow' model -- phenomena besides
standard meson-baryon physics manifest at long distance scales -- but without
that model's isolable fractional electric charges.
