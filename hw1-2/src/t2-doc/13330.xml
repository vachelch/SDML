Duality Between String Junctions and D-Branes on Del Pezzo Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We revisit local mirror symmetry associated with del Pezzo surfaces in
Calabi-Yau threefolds in view of five-dimensional N=1 E_N theories compactified
on a circle. The mirror partner of singular Calabi-Yau with a shrinking del
Pezzo four-cycle is described as the affine 7-brane backgrounds probed by a
D3-brane. Evaluating the mirror map and the BPS central charge we relate
junction charges to RR charges of D-branes wrapped on del Pezzo surfaces. This
enables us to determine how the string junctions are mapped to D-branes on del
Pezzo surfaces.
