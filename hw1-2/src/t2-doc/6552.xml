Intersecting Branes in Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct BPS states in the matrix description of M-theory. Starting from
a set of basic M-theory branes, we study pair intersections which preserve
supersymmetry. The fractions of the maximal supersymmetry obtained in this way
are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 3/16 and 1/16. In explicit examples we establish that the
matrix BPS states correspond to (intersecting) brane configurations that are
obtained from the d=11 supersymmetry algebra. This correspondence for the 1/2
supersymmetric branes includes the precise relations between the charges.
