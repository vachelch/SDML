The vertex formulation of the Bazhanov-Baxter Model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we formulate an integrable model on the simple cubic lattice.
The $N$ -- valued spin variables of the model belong to edges of the lattice.
The Boltzmann weights of the model obey the vertex type Tetrahedron Equation.
In the thermodynamic limit our model is equivalent to the Bazhanov -- Baxter
Model. In the case when $N=2$ we reproduce the Korepanov's and Hietarinta's
solutions of the Tetrahedron equation as some special cases.
