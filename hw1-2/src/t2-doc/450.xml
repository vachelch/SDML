Two-Loop $\phi^4$-Diagrams from String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the {\em cutting and sewing} procedure we show how to get Feynman
diagrams, up to two-loop order, of $\Phi^{4}$-theory with an internal SU(N)
symmetry group, starting from tachyon amplitudes of the open bosonic string
theory. In a properly defined field theory limit, we easily identify the
corners of the string moduli space reproducing the correctly normalized field
theory amplitudes expressed in the Schwinger parametrization.
