Strings in de Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  We study both global as well as local (Nielsen-Olesen) strings in de Sitter
space. While these type of topological defects have been studied in the
background of a de Sitter metric previously, we study here the full set of
coupled equations. We find only ``closed'' solutions. The behaviour of the
metric tensor of these solutions resembles that of ``supermassive'' strings
with a curvature singularity at the cosmological horizon. For global strings
(and the composite defect) we are able to construct solutions which are regular
on the interval from the origin to the cosmological horizon if the global
string core lies completely inside the horizon.
