Finite quantum field theories: Clifford algebras for Yukawa couplings?
</title>

<abstract>
  By imposing on the most general renormalizable quantum field theory the
requirement of the absence of ultraviolet-divergent renormalizations of the
physical parameters (masses and coupling constants) of the theory, finite
quantum field theories in four space-time dimensions may be constructed. Famous
prototypes of these form certain well-known classes of supersymmetric finite
quantum field theories. Within a perturbative evaluation of the quantum field
theories under consideration, the starting point of all such investigations is
represented by the conditions for one- and two-loop finiteness of the gauge
couplings as well as for one-loop finiteness of the Yukawa couplings.
Particularly attractive solutions of the one-loop Yukawa finiteness condition
involve Yukawa couplings which are equivalent to generators of Clifford
algebras with identity element. However, a closer inspection shows, at least
for all simple gauge groups up to and including rank 8, that these
Clifford-like solutions prove to be inconsistent with the requirements of one-
and two-loop finiteness of the gauge coupling and of absence of gauge
anomalies.
