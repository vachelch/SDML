A Viable Cosmology with a Scalar Field Coupled to the Trace of the
  Stress-Tensor
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the cosmological evolution of a scalar field that couples to the
trace $T=T^{a}_a$ of energy momentum tensor of all the fields (including
itself). In the case of a shallow exponential potential, the presence of
coupling to the trace $T$ in the field equation makes the energy density of the
scalar field decrease faster thereby hastening the commencement of radiation
domination. This effect gradually diminishes at later epochs allowing the
scalar field to dominate the energy density again. We interpret this phase as
the current epoch of cosmic acceleration with $\Omega_{\phi}=0.7$. A variant of
this model can lead to accelerated expansion at the present epoch followed by a
$a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$ behaviour as $t\to \infty$, making the model free from
future event horizon. The main features of the model are independent of initial
conditions. However, fine tuning of parameters is necessary for viable
evolution.
