N=2 Harmonic Superforms, Multiplets and Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we develop the formalism to study superforms in N=2 harmonic
superspace. We perform a thorough (if not complete) analysis of the superforms
starting from 0-form and moving all the way up to 6-form. Like the N=1 case we
find that the lower superforms (0,1,2,3) describe the various important N=2
supermultiplets. Also, the forms form chains, the field strength of 0-form
being related to the gauge form of the 1-form, and so on. However, an important
difference with the N=1 case is that there is now more than one chain.
  Our main aim was to study the higher-forms (4,5,6) to obtain the various N=2
action formulas via the ectoplasmic approach. Indeed, we reproduce the three
known action formulas involving a volume integral, a contour integral and no
integral over the harmonic subspace from the 6, 5 and 4-form analysis
respectively. The next aim is to generalize the analysis to curved space-time
(supergravity).
