Topological Models on the Lattice and a Remark on String Theory Cloning
</title>

<abstract>
  The addition of a topological model to the matter content of a conventional
closed-string theory leads to the appearance of many perturbatively-decoupled
space-time worlds. We illustrate this by classifying topological vertex models
on a triangulated surface. We comment on how such worlds could have been
coupled in the Planck era.
