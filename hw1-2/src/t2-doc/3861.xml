Wave functions and properties of massive states in three-dimensional
  supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
</title>

  We apply supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ) to the study
of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on R x S^1 x S^1. One of the compact
directions is chosen to be light-like and the other to be space-like. Since the
SDLCQ regularization explicitly preserves supersymmetry, this theory is totally
finite, and thus we can solve for bound-state wave functions and masses
numerically without renormalizing. We present an overview of all the massive
states of this theory, and we see that the spectrum divides into two distinct
and disjoint sectors. In one sector the SDLCQ approximation is only valid up to
intermediate coupling. There we find a well defined and well behaved set of
states, and we present a detailed analysis of these states and their
properties. In the other sector, which contains a completely different set of
states, we present a much more limited analysis for strong coupling only. We
find that, while these state have a well defined spectrum, their masses grow
with the transverse momentum cutoff. We present an overview of these states and
their properties.
