Non commutative geometry for outsiders; an elementary introduction to
  motivations and tools
</title>

<abstract>
  Since the subject of noncommutative geometry is now entering maturity, we
felt there is need for presentation of the material at an undergraduate course
level. Our review is a zero order approximation to this project. Thus, the
present paper attempts to offer some motivations and mathematical prerequisites
for a deeper study or at least to serve as support in glancing at recent
results in theoretical physics.
