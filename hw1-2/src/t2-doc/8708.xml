Vacuum densities and zero-point energy for fields obeying Robin
  conditions on cylindrical surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The Casimir effect for general Robin conditions on the surface of a cylinder
in $D$-spacetime dimensions is studied for massive scalar field with general
curvature coupling. The energy distribution and vacuum stress are investigated.
We separate volumic and superficial energy contributions, for both interior and
exterior space regions. The possibility that some special conditions may be
energetically singled out is indicated.
