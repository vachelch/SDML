Eigenstates of Paraparticle Creation Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  Eigenstates of the parabose and parafermi creation operators are constructed.
In the Dirac contour representation, the parabose eigenstates correspond to the
dual vectors of the parabose coherent states. In order $p=2$, conserved-charge
parabose creation operator eigenstates are also constructed. The contour forms
of the associated resolutions of unity are obtained.
