Brane-Antibrane Systems at Finite Temperature and the Entropy of Black
  Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider D-brane/anti-D-brane systems at T>0. Starting at the closed
string vacuum, we argue that a finite temperature leads to the reappearance of
open string degrees of freedom. We also show that, at a sufficiently large
temperature, the open string vacuum becomes stable. Building upon this
observation and previous work by Horowitz, Maldacena and Strominger, we
formulate a microscopic brane-antibrane model for the non-extremal black
three-brane in ten dimensions (as well as for the black two- and five-branes in
eleven dimensions). Under reasonable assumptions, and using known results from
the AdS/CFT correspondence, the microscopic entropy agrees with the
supergravity result up to a factor of 2^(p/p+1), with p the dimension of the
brane. The negative specific heat and pressure of the black brane have a simple
interpretation in terms of brane-antibrane annihilation. We also find in the
model states resembling black holes and other lower-dimensional black branes.
