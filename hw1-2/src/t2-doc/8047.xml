Baryon Spectra and AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a detailed map between wrapped D3-branes in Anti-de Sitter (AdS)
backgrounds and dibaryon operators in the corresponding conformal field theory
(CFT). The effective five dimensional action governing the dynamics of AdS
space contains a $U(1)_R$ gauge field that mediates interactions between
objects possessing R-charge. We show that the $U(1)_R$ charge of these wrapped
D3-branes as measured by the gauge field matches the R-charge of the dibaryons
expected from field theory considerations. We are able, through a careful probe
brane calculation in an $AdS_5\times T^{1,1}$ background, to understand the
exact relation between the mass of the wrapped D3-brane and the dimension of
the corresponding dibaryon. We also make some steps toward matching the
counting of dibaryon operators in the CFT with the ground states of a
supersymmetric quantum mechanical system whose target space is the moduli space
of D-branes. Finally, we discuss BPS excitations of the D3-brane and compare
them with higher dimension operators in the CFT.
