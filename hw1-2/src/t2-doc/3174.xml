An exceptional geometry for d=11 supergravity?
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the algebraic constraints of the generalized vielbein in SO(1,2) x
SO(16) invariant d=11 supergravity, and show that the bosonic degrees of
freedom of d=11 supergravity, which become the physical ones upon reduction to
d=3, can be assembled into an E_8-valued vielbein already in eleven dimensions.
A crucial role in the construction is played by the maximal nilpotent commuting
subalgebra of E_8, of dimension 36, suggesting a partial unification of general
coordinate and tensor gauge transformations.
