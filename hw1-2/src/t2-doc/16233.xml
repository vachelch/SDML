Gravitating Dyons and Dyonic Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study static spherically symmetric gravitating dyon solutions and dyonic
black holes in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. The gravitating dyon solutions
share many features with the gravitating monopole solutions. In particular,
gravitating dyon solutions and dyonic black holes exist up to a maximal
coupling constant, and beside the fundamental dyon solutions there are excited
dyon solutions.
