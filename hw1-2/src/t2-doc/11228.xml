Question on D=26 --- String Theory versus Quantum Gravity ---
</title>

<abstract>
  In the covariant-gauge two-dimensional quantum gravity, various derivations
of the critical dimension D=26 of the bosonic string are critically reviewed,
and their interrelations are clarified. It is shown that the string theory is
not identical with the proper framework of the two-dimensional quantum gravity,
but the former should be regarded as a particular aspect of the latter. The
appearance of various anomalies is shown to be explainable in terms of a new
type of anomaly in a unified way.
