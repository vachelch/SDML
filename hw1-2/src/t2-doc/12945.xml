The Potts-q random matrix model : loop equations, critical exponents,
  and rational case
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article, we study the q-state Potts random matrix models extended to
branched polymers, by the equations of motion method. We obtain a set of loop
equations valid for any arbitrary value of q. We show that, for q=2-2 \cos {l
\over r} \pi (l, r mutually prime integers with l < r), the resolvent satisfies
an algebraic equation of degree 2 r -1 if l+r is odd and r-1 if l+r is even.
This generalizes the presently-known cases of q=1, 2, 3. We then derive for any
0 \leq q \leq 4 the Potts-q critical exponents and string susceptibility.
