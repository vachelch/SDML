Phase Structure of Supersymmetric Models at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We study O(N) symmetric supersymmetric models in three dimensions at finite
temperature. These models are known to have an interesting phase structures. In
particular, in the limit $N \to \infty$ one finds spontaneous breaking of scale
invariance with no explicit breaking. Supersymmetry is softly broken at finite
temperature and the peculiar phase structure and properties seen at T=0 are
studied here at finite temperature.
