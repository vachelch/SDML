New Confining N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories which confine in the presence of
a tree-level superpotential. We show the confining spectra which satisfy the 't
Hooft anomaly matching conditions and give a simple method to find the
confining superpotential. Using this method we fix the confining
superpotentials in the simplest cases, and show how these superpotentials are
generated by multi-instanton effects in the dual theory. These new type of
confining theories may be useful for model building, since the size of the
matter content is not restricted by an index constraint. Therefore, one expects
that a large variety of new confining spectra can be obtained using such
models.
