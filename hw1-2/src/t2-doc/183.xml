Non-diagonal solutions to reflection equations in $su(n)$ spin chains
</title>

<abstract>
The reflection equations in a $su(3)$ spin chain with open boundary conditions
are analyzed. We find non diagonal solutions to the boundary matrices. The
corresponding hamiltonian is given. The solutions are generalized to $su(n)$.
