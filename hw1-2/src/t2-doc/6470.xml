Realization of D4-Branes at Angles in Super Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  An explicit solution in super Yang-Mills theory, which after T-duality
describes two sets of D4-branes at angles, is constructed. The gauge
configuration possesses 3/16 unbroken supersymmetry for the equal magnitudes of
field strengths, and can be considered as the counterpart of the solution of
D=11 supergravity with the same amount of supersymmetry in the solutions given
by Gauntlett et al. The energy of the Born-Infeld action of the gauge
configuration gives further evidence for the geometrical interpretation as two
sets of D4-branes at angles. The energy of super Yang-Mills theory is shown to
coincide with that of M(atrix) theory. This fact shows that the configuration
with 3/16 supersymmetry can be realized in M(atrix) theory, which describes two
sets of longitudinal M5-branes (with common string direction) at angles.
