Reduction of the Two Body Problem in N=2 Chern Simons Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  By an extension of the methods used for the reduction of the two body problem
in 2+1 dimensional gravity, we show that the two body problem in N=2 Chern
Simons supergravity can be reduced exactly to an equivalent on body formalism.
We give exact expressions for the invariants of the reduced one body problem.
