Knots, links and branes at large N
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Wilson loop observables for Chern-Simons theory at large N and
its topological string dual and extend the previous checks for this duality to
the case of links. We find an interesting structure involving
representation/spin degeneracy of branes ending on branes which features in the
large N dual description of Chern-Simons theory. This leads to a refinement of
the integer invariants for links and knots. We illustrate our results with
explicit computations on the Chern-Simons side.
