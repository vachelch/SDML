To the problem of 1/Nc approximation in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article, the gap equation for the constituent quark mass in the
U(2)*U(2) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for the 1/Nc approximation is investigated.
It is shown that taking into account scalar isovector mesons plays an important
role for the correct description of quark masses in this approximation. The
role of the Ward identity in calculations of 1/Nc corrections to the meson
vertex functions is shortly discussed.
