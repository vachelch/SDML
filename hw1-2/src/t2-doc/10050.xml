sl(N) Onsager's Algebra and Integrability
</title>

<abstract>
We define an $ sl(N) $ analog of Onsager's Algebra through a finite set of
relations that generalize the Dolan Grady defining relations for the original
Onsager's Algebra. This infinite-dimensional Lie Algebra is shown to be
isomorphic to a fixed point subalgebra of $ sl(N) $ Loop Algebra with respect
to a certain involution. As the consequence of the generalized Dolan Grady
relations a Hamiltonian linear in the generators of $ sl(N) $ Onsager's Algebra
is shown to posses an infinite number of mutually commuting integrals of
motion.
