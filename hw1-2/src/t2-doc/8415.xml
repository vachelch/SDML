The BRST Operator for the Large $N=4$ Superconformal Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the detailed structure of the large $N=4$ superconformal algebra,
and construct its BRST operator which constitutes the main object for analyzing
$N=4$ strings. We then derive the general condition for the nilpotency of the
BRST operator and show that there exists a line of critical $N=4$ string
theories.
