Constructing Gravitational Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  It would be extremely useful to know whether a particular low energy
effective theory might have come from a compactification of a higher
dimensional space. Here, this problem is approached from the ground up by
considering theories with multiple interacting massive gravitons. It is
actually very difficult to construct discrete gravitational dimensions which
have a local continuum limit. In fact, any model with only nearest neighbor
interactions is doomed. If we could find a non-linear extension for the
Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian for a graviton of mass mg which does not break down
until the scale Lambda_2=(mg Mpl)^(1/2), this could be used to construct a
large class of models whose continuum limit is local in the extra dimension.
But this is shown to be impossible: a theory with a single graviton must break
down by Lambda_3 = (mg^2 Mpl)^(1/3). Next, we look at how the discretization
prescribed by the truncation of the KK tower of an honest extra diemsinon
rasies the scale of strong coupling. It dictates an intricate set of
interactions among various fields which conspire to soften the strongest
scattering amplitudes and allow for a local continuum limit. A number of
canditate symmetries associated with locality in the discretized dimension are
also discussed.
