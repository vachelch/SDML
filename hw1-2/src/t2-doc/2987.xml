A Four-Reggeon Vertex for ${\bf Z}_3$ Twisted Fermionic Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Using operator sewing techniques we construct the Reggeon vertex involving
four external ${\bf Z}_3$-twisted complex fermionic fields. Generalizing a
procedure recently applied to the ordinary Ramond four-vertex, we deduce the
closed form of the ${\bf Z}_3$ vertex by demanding it to reproduce the results
obtained by sewing.
