From Virasoro Constraints in Kontsevich's Model to $\cal W$-constraints
  in 2-matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The Ward identities in Kontsevich-like 1-matrix models are used to prove at
the level of discrete matrix models the suggestion of Gava and Narain, which
relates the degree of potential in asymmetric 2-matrix model to the form of
$\cal W$-constraints imposed on its partition function.
