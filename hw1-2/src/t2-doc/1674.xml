Causal Entropy Bound for Non-Singular Cosmologies
</title>

<abstract>
  The conditions for validity of the Causal Entropy Bound (CEB) are verified in
the context of non-singular cosmologies with classical sources. It is shown
that they are the same conditions that were previously found to guarantee
validity of the CEB: the energy density of each dynamical component of the
cosmic fluid needs to be sub-Planckian and not too negative, and its equation
of state needs to be causal. In the examples we consider, the CEB is able to
discriminate cosmologies which suffer from potential physical problems more
reliably than the energy conditions appearing in singularity theorems.
