The State-Vector Space for Two-Mode Parabosons and Charged Parabose
  Coherent States
</title>

<abstract>
  The structure of the state-vector space for the two-mode parabose system is
investigated and a complete set of state-vectors is constructed. The basis
vectors are orthonormal in order $p=2$. In order $p=2$, conserved-charge
parabose coherent states are constructed and an explicit completeness relation
is obtained.
