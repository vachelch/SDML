Monopoles, Dyons and Theta Term in Dirac-Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present dyon solutions to an SU(2) Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) gauge theory
coupled to a Higgs triplet. We consider different non-Abelian extensions of the
DBI action and study the resulting solutions numerically, comparing them with
the standard Julia-Zee dyons. We discuss the existence of a critical value of
$\beta$, the Born-Infeld absolute field parameter, below which the solution
ceases to exist. We also analyse the effect of modifying the DBI action so as
to include the analogous of the $\theta$ term, showing that Witten formula for
the dyon charge also holds in DBI theories.
