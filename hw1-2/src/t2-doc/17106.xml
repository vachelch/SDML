Currents and charges for mixed fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an analysis of currents and charges for a system of two mixed
fields, both for spinless bosons and for Dirac fermions. This allows us to
obtain in a straightforward way the exact field theoretical oscillation
formulas exhibiting corrections with respect to the usual ones derived in
quantum mechanics.
