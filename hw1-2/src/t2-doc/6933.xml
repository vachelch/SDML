On the Algebraic Structure of Gravity with Torsion including Weyl
  symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The BRST transformations for gravity with torsion including Weyl symmetry are
discussed by using the so-called Maurer-Cartan horizontality conditions. Also
the coupling of scalar matter fields to gravity is incorporated in this
analysis. With the help of an operator $\d$ which allows to decompose the
exterior space-time derivative as a BRST commutator we solve the Wess-Zumino
consistency condition corresponding to invariant Lagrangians and anomalies for
the cases with and without Weyl symmetry.
