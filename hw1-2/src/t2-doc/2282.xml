Response to Tarrach's "Mode Dependent Field Renormalization and
  Trivialty"
</title>

<abstract>
  We respond to Tarrach's criticisms (hep-th/9511034) of our work on lambda
Phi^4 theory.  Tarrach does not discuss the same renormalization procedure
that we do. He also relies on results from perturbation theory that are not
valid. There is no "infrared divergence" or unphysical behaviour associated
with the zero-momentum limit of our effective action.
