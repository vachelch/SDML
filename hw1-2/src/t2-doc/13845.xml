Spinning Braid Group Representation and the Fractional Quantum Hall
  Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  The path integral approach to representing braid group is generalized for
particles with spin. Introducing the notion of {\em charged} winding number in
the super-plane, we represent the braid group generators as homotopically
constrained Feynman kernels. In this framework, super Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
operators appear naturally in the Hamiltonian, suggesting the possibility of
{\em spinning nonabelian} anyons. We then apply our formulation to the study of
fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). A systematic discussion of the ground
states and their quasi-hole excitations is given. We obtain Laughlin, Halperin
and Moore-Read states as {\em exact} ground state solutions to the respective
Hamiltonians associated to the braid group representations. The energy gap of
the quasi-excitation is also obtainable from this approach.
