Instanton Numbers and Exchange Symmetries in $N=2$ Dual String Pairs
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note, we comment on Calabi-Yau spaces with Hodge numbers $h_{1,1}=3$
and $h_{2,1}=243$. We focus on the Calabi-Yau space $WP_{1,1,2,8,12}(24)$ and
show how some of its instanton numbers are related to coefficients of certain
modular forms. We also comment on the relation of four dimensional exchange
symmetries in certain $N=2$ dual models to six dimensional heterotic/heterotic
string duality.
