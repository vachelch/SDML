Short Strings in Abelian Higgs Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the monopole-antimonopole static potential in the confining phase
of the Abelian Higgs model and in particular the corrections to the
Coulomb-like potential at small distances r. By minimizing numerically the
classical energy functional we observe a linear in r, stringy correction even
at distances much smaller than the apparent physical scales. We argue that this
term is a manifestation of the condition that the monopoles are connected by a
mathematically thin line along which the scalar field vanishes. These short
strings modify the operator product expansion as well. Implications for QCD are
discussed.
