Self-duality and the Supersymmetric KdV Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the supersymmetric KdV equation can be obtained from the
self-duality condition on Yang-Mills fields in four dimension associated with
the graded Lie algebra OSp(2/1). We also obtain the hierarchy of Susy KdV
equations from such a condition. We formulate the Susy KdV hierarchy as a
vanishing curvature condition associated with the U(1) group and show how an
Abelian self-duality condition in four dimension can also lead to these
equations.
