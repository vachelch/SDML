On the Effective Action of N=1 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a generalization of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective
low-energy action for N=1 SUSY Yang-Mills theory which includes composite
operators interpolating pure gluonic bound states. The chiral supermultiplet of
anomalies is embedded in a larger three-form multiplet and an extra term in the
effective action is introduced. The mass spectrum and mixing of the lowest-spin
bound states are studied within the effective Lagrangian approach. The physical
mass eigenstates form two multiplets, each containing a scalar, pseudoscalar
and Weyl fermion. The multiplet containing the states which are most closely
related to glueballs is the lighter one.
