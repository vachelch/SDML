Identical Particles and Permutation Group

  Second quantization is revisited and creation and annihilation operators
areshown to be related, on the same footing both to the algebra h(1), and to
the superalgebra osp(1|2) that are shown to be both compatible with Bose and
Fermi statistics.
  The two algebras are completely equivalent in the one-mode sector but,
because of grading of osp(1|2), differ in the many-particle case.
  The same scheme is straightforwardly extended to the quantum case h_q(1) and
osp_q(1|2).
