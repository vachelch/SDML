The Strength of String Nonperturbative Effects and Strong-Weak Coupling
  Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  A strong-weak coupling duality symmetry of the string equations of motion has
been suggested in the literature. This symmetry implies that vacua occur in
pairs. Since the coupling constant is a dynamical variable in string theory,
tunneling solutions between strong and weak coupling vacua may exist. Such
solutions would naturally lead to nonperturbative effects with anomalous
coupling dependence. A highly simplified example is given.
