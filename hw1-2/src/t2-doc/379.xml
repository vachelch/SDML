Cubic String Field Theory in pp-wave Background and Background
  Independent Moyal Structure
</title>

<abstract>
  We study Witten open string field theory in the pp-wave background in the
tensionless limit, and construct the N-string vertex in the basis which
diagonalizes the string perturbative spectrum. We found that the Witten
*-product can be viewed as infinite copies of the Moyal product with the same
noncommutativity parameter $\theta=2$. Moreover, we show that this Moyal
structure is universal in the sense that, written in the string bit basis,
Witten's *-product for any background can always be given in terms of the
above-mentioned Moyal structure. We identify some projective operators in this
algebra that we argue to correspond to D-branes of the theory.
