Quest for Localized 4-D Black Holes in Brane Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the possibility of obtaining localized black hole solutions in
brane worlds by introducing a dependence of the four-dimensional line--element
on the extra dimension. An analysis, performed for the cases of an empty bulk
and of a bulk containing either a scalar or a gauge field, reveals that no
conventional type of matter can support such a dependence. Considering a
particular ansatz for the five-dimensional line--element that corresponds to a
black hole solution with a ``decaying'' horizon, we determine the bulk
energy--momentum tensor capable of sustaining such a behaviour. It turns out
that an exotic, shell-like distribution of matter is required. For such
solutions, the black hole singularity is indeed localized near the brane and
the spacetime is well defined near the AdS horizon, in contrast to the
behaviour found in black string type solutions.
