The BPS Domain Wall Solutions in Self-Dual Chern-Simons-Higgs Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We study domain wall solitons in the relativistic self-dual Chern-Simons
Higgs systems by the dimensional reduction method to two dimensional spacetime.
The Bogomolny bound on the energy is given by two conserved quantities in a
similar way that the energy bound for BPS dyons is set in some Yang-Mills-Higgs
systems in four dimensions. We find the explicit soliton configurations which
saturate the energy bound and their nonrelativistic counter parts. We also
discuss the underlying N=2 supersymmetry.
