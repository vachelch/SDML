Negative Flows of the KP-Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a Grassmannian-like formulation for the potential KP-hierarchy
including additional ``negative'' flows. Our approach will generalize the
notion of a tau-function to include negative flows. We compare the resulting
hierarchy with results by Hirota, Satsuma and Bogoyavlenskii.
