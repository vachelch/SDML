Unstable Systems in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the state of an unstable particle can be defined in terms of
stable asymptotic states. This general definition is used to discuss and to
solve some old problems connected with the short-time and large-time behaviour
of the non-decay amplitude.
