The $W_{1+\infty}(gl_s)$--symmetries of the $S$--component KP hierarchy
</title>

  Adler, Shiota and van Moerbeke obtained for the KP and Toda lattice
hierarchies a formula which translates the action of the vertex operator on
tau--functions to an action of a vertex operator of pseudo-differential
operators on wave functions. This relates the additional symmetries of the KP
and Toda lattice hierarchyto the $W_{1+\infty}$--, respectively
$W_{1+\infty}\times W_{1+\infty}$--algebra symmeties. In this paper we
generalize the results to the $s$--component KP hierarchy. The vertex operators
generate the algebra $W_{1+\infty}(gl_s)$, the matrix version of
$W_{1+\infty}$. Since the Toda lattice hierarchy is equivalent to the
$2$--component KP hierarchy, the results of this paper uncover in that
particular case a much richer structure than the one obtained by Adler, Shiota
and van Moerbeke.
