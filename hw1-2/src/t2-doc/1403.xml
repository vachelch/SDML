Duality of N=2 Heterotic -- Type I Compactifications in Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss type I -- heterotic duality in four-dimensional models obtained as
a Coulomb phase of the six-dimensional U(16) orientifold model compactified on
T^2 with arbitrary SU(16) Wilson lines. We show that Kahler potentials, gauge
threshold corrections and the infinite tower of higher derivative F-terms agree
in the limit that corresponds to weak coupling, large T^2 heterotic
compactifications. On the type I side, all these quantities are completely
determined by the spectrum of N=2 BPS states that originate from D=6 massless
superstring modes.
