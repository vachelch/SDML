The canonical connection in quantum mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we investigate the form of induced gauge fields that arises in
two types of quantum systems. In the first we consider quantum mechanics on
coset spaces G/H, and argue that G-invariance is central to the emergence of
the H-connection as induced gauge fields in the different quantum sectors. We
then demonstrate why the same connection, now giving rise to the non-abelian
generalization of Berry's phase, can also be found in systems which have slow
variables taking values in such a coset space.
