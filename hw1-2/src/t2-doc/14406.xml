The Asymptotics of the Correlations Functions in $(1+1)d$ Quantum Field
  Theory From Finite Size Effects in Conformal Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the finite-size effects the scaling dimensions and correlation
functions of the main operators in continuous and lattice models of 1d spinless
Bose-gas with pairwise interaction of rather general form are obtained. The
long-wave properties of these systems can be described by the Gaussian model
with central charge $c=1$. The disorder operators of the extended Gaussian
model are found to correspond to some non-local operators in the {\it XXZ}
Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Just the same approach is applicable to fermionic
systems. Scaling dimensions of operators and correlation functions in the
systems of interacting Fermi-particles are obtained. We present a universal
treatment for $1d$ systems of different kinds which is independent of the exact
integrability and gives universal expressions for critical exponents through
the thermodynamic characteristics of the system.
