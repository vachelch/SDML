Non-Abelian Giant Gravitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the giant graviton configurations known from the literature
have a complementary, microscopical description in terms of multiple
gravitational waves undergoing a dielectric (or magnetic moment) effect. We
present a non-Abelian effective action for these gravitational waves with
dielectric couplings and show that stable dielectric solutions exist. These
solutions agree in the large $N$ limit with the giant graviton configurations
in the literature.
