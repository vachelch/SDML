Hamiltonian Formulations of Yang-Mills Quantum Theory and the Gribov
  Problem
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the status of quantising (non-abelian) gauge theories using
different versions of a Hamiltonian formulation corresponding to Dirac's
instant and front form of dynamics, respectively. In order to control infrared
divergences we work in a finite spatial volume, chosing a torus geometry for
convenience. We focus on the determination of the physical configuration space
of gauge invariant variables via gauge fixing. This naturally leads us to the
issue of the Gribov problem. We discuss it for different gauge choices, in
particular finite volume modifications of the axial gauge. Conventional and
light-front quantisation are compared and the differences pointed out.
