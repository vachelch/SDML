Noncommutative U(1) Instantons in Eight Dimensional Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the noncommutative version of the extended ADHM construction in the
eight dimensional U(1) Yang-Mills theory. This construction gives rise to the
solutions of the BPS equations in the Yang-Mills theory, and these solutions
preserve at least 3/16 of supersymmetries. In a wide subspace of the extended
ADHM data, we show that the integer $k$ which appears in the extended ADHM
construction should be interpreted as the $D4$-brane charge rather than the
$D0$-brane charge by explicitly calculating the topological charges in the case
that the noncommutativity parameter is anti-self-dual. We also find the
relationship with the solution generating technique and show that the integer
$k$ can be interpreted as the charge of the $D0$-brane bound to the $D8$-brane
with the $B$-field in the case that the noncommutativity parameter is
self-dual.
