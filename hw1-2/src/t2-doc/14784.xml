Generalized Integrability and the connections between Skyrme-Faddeev and
  Yang Mills theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Skyrme theory on S^2 (Faddeev coset proposal), is analyzed with a
generalization of 0-curvature integrability, based on gauge techniques. New
expressions valid for models in the sphere are given. The relation of the
minimum energy configurations to gauge vacua is clarified. Consequences of
adding a potential term to break the SO(3) symmetry are discussed.
