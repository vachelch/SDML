Antifield BRST quantization of duality-symmetric Maxwell theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform the antifield BRST quantization of duality-symmetric Maxwell
theory and show explicitly the quantum equivalence of the different
formulations (covariant and non-covariant). The non-covariant gauge-fixed
action is used in the computation of propagators for this model.
