Non-Renormalization Theorems for Operators with Arbitrary Numbers of
  Derivatives in ${\cal N}=4$ Yang Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the proof of the non-renormalization of the four derivative
operators in ${\cal N}=4$ Yang Mills theory with gauge group SU(2) to show that
certain terms with 2N derivatives are not renormalized in the theory with
gauge group SU(N). These terms may be determined exactly by a simple
perturbative computation. Similar results hold for finite ${\cal N}=2$
theories. We comment on the implications of these results.
