Gaugino Condensation, S-Duality and Supersymmetry Breaking in
  Supergravity Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The status of the gaugino condensation as the source of supersymmetry
breaking is reexamined. It is argued that one cannot have stable minima with
broken supersymmetry in models where the dilaton is coupled only linearly to
the gaugino condensate. We show that the problems of the gaugino condensate
mechanism can be solved by considering nonstandard gauge kinetic functions,
created by nonperturbative effects. As an example we use the principle of
S-duality to modify the coupling of the gaugino condensate to effective
supergravity (superstring) Lagrangians. We show that such an approach can solve
the problem of the runaway dilaton and lead to satisfactory supersymmetry
breaking in models with a {\em single} gaugino condensate. We exhibit a general
property of theories containing a symmetry acting on the dilaton and also shed
some light on the question whether it is generically the auxiliary field of the
modulus $T$, which dominates supersymmetry breaking.
