Conformal boundary conditions and three-dimensional topological field

<abstract>
  We present a general construction of all correlation functions of a
two-dimensional rational conformal field theory, for an arbitrary number of
bulk and boundary fields and arbitrary topologies. The correlators are
expressed in terms of Wilson graphs in a certain three-manifold, the connecting
manifold. The amplitudes constructed this way can be shown to be modular
invariant and to obey the correct factorization rules.
