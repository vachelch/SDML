Phase Transition in Anyon Superconductivity at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The magnetic response of the charged anyon fluid at temperatures larger than
the fermion energy gap is investigated in the self-consistent field
approximation. In this temperature region a new phase, characterized by an
inhomogeneous magnetic penetration, is found. The inhomogeneity is linked to
the existence of an imaginary magnetic mass which increases with the
temperature. The system stability in the new phase is proved by investigating
the electromagnetic field rest-energy spectrum.
