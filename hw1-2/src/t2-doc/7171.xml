P-Branes, Poisson-Sigma-Models and Embedding Approach to (p+1)-
  Dimensional Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalization of the embedding approach for d-dimensional gravity based
upon p-brane theories is considered. We show that the D-dimensional p-brane
coupled to an antisymmetric tensor field of rank (p+1) provides the dynamical
basis for the description of d=(p+1) dimensional gravity in the isometric
embedding formalism. ''Physical'' matter appears in such an approach as a
manifestation of a D-dimensional antisymmetric tensor (generalized Kalb-
Ramond) background. For the simplest case, the Lorentz harmonic formulation of
the bosonic string in a Kalb-Ramond background and its relation to a first
order Einstein-Cartan approach for d=2 dimensional gravity is analysed in
some detail. A general Poisson-sigma-model structure emerges. For the minimal
choice of D=3 an interesting ``dual'' formulation is found which has the
structure of a Jackiw-Teitelboim theory, coupled minimally to a massive scalar
field. Our approach is intended to serve as a preparation for the study of d-
dimensional supergravity theory, either starting from the generalized action of
free supersymmetric (d-1)-branes or $D_{(d-1)}$-branes, or from the
corresponding geometric equations ('rheotropic' conditions).
