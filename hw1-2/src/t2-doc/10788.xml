Charge-monopole versus Gravitational Scattering at Planckian Energies
</title>

<abstract>
  The amplitude for the scattering of a point magnetic monopole and a point
charge, at centre-of-mass energies much larger than the masses of the
particles, and in the limit of low momentum transfer, is shown to be
proportional to the (integer-valued) monopole strength, assuming the Dirac
quantization condition for the monopole-charge system. It is demonstrated that,
for small momentum transfer, charge-monopole electromagnetic effects remain
comparable to those due to the gravitational interaction between the particles
even at Planckian centre-of-mass energies.
