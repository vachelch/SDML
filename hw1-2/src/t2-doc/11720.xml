Nested braneworlds and strong brane gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the gravitational field of a `nested' domain wall living entirely
within a brane-universe, or, a localised vortex within a wall. For a vortex
living on a critical Randall-Sundrum brane universe, we show that the induced
gravitational field on the brane is identical to that of an (n-1)-dimensional
vacuum domain wall. We also describe how to set-up a nested Randall-Sundrum
scenario using a flat critical vortex living on a subcritical (adS) brane
universe.
