Integrability of the Wess_Zumino-Witten model as a non-ultralocal theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the 2--dimensional Wess--Zumino--Witten (WZW) model in the
canonical formalism introduced in a previous paper by two of us. Using an
$r$--$s$ matrix approach to non--ultralocal field theories we find the Poisson
algebra of monodromy matrices and of conserved quantities with a new,
non--dynamical, $r$ matrix.
