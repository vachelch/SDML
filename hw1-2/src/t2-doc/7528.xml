Instantons in Burgers Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The instanton solution for the forced Burgers equation is found. This
solution describes the exponential tail of the probability distribution
function of velocity differences in the region where shock waves are absent.
The results agree with the one found recently by Polyakov, who used the
operator product conjecture. If this conjecture is true, then our WKB
asymptotics of the Wyld functional integral is exact to all orders of the
perturbative expansion around the instanton solution. We explicitly checked
this in the first order. We also generalized our solution for the arbitrary
dimension of Burgers (=KPZ) equation. As a result we found the angular
dependence of the velocity difference PDF.
