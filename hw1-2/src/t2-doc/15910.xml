Return of the Torsion D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study D-branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds, carrying charges which are torsion
elements of the K-theory. Interesting physics ensues when we follow these
branes into nongeometrical phases of the compactification. On the level of
K-theory, we determine the monodromies of the group of charges as we circle
singular loci in the closed string moduli space. Going beyond K-theory, we
discuss the stability of torsion D-branes as a function of the K\"ahler moduli.
When the fundamental group of the Calabi-Yau is nonabelian, we find evidence
for new threshold bound states of BPS branes. In a two-parameter example, we
compare our results with computations in the Gepner model. Our study of the
torsion D-branes in the compactification of [FHSV] sheds light on the physics
of that model. In particular, we develop a proposal for the group of allowed
D-brane charges in the presence of discrete RR fluxes.
