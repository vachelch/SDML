Can DLCQ test the Maldacena Conjecture?
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Maldacena conjecture applied to the near horizon geometry of
a D1-brane in the supergravity approximation and consider the possibility of
testing the conjecture against the boundary field theory calculation using
DLCQ. We propose the two point function of the stress energy tensor as a
convenient quantity that may be computed on both sides of the correspondence.
On the supergravity side, we may invoke the methods of Gubser, Klebanov,
Polyakov, and Witten. On the field theory side, we derive an explicit
expression for the two point function in terms of data that may be extracted
from a DLCQ calculation at a given harmonic resolution. This gives rise to a
well defined numerical algorithm for computing the two point function, which we
test in the context of free fermions and the 't Hooft model. For the
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with 16 supercharges that arises in the
Maldacena conjecture, the algorithm is perfectly well defined, although the
size of the numerical computation grows too fast to admit any detailed analysis
at present, and our results are only preliminary. We are, however, able to
present more detailed results on the supersymmetric DLCQ computation of the
stress energy tensor correlators for two dimensional Yang Mills theories with
(1,1) and (2,2) supersymmetries.
