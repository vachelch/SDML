Large-N behaviors of the IIB matrix model and the regularized Schild
  models
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate $N$ dependences of correlation functions in the bosonic part of
the IIB matrix model by the Monte Carlo method. We also evaluate those in two
sorts of regularized Schild models and find that the $N$ dependences are
different from those in the matrix model. In particular, the distribution of
the eigenvalues are logarithmically divergent in the regularized Schild model
when $g^2N$ is fixed.
