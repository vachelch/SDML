Topological 2-Dimensional Quantum Mechanics

<abstract>
  We define a Chern- Simons Lagrangian for a system of planar particles
topologically interacting at a distance. The anyon model appears as a
particular case where all the particles are identical. We propose exact N-body
eigenstates, set up a perturbative algorithm, discuss the case where some
particles are fixed on a lattice, and also consider curved manifolds. PACS
