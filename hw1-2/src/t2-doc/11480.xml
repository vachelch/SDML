Nonrenormalization Theorem for Gauge Coupling in 2+1D
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that $\be$-function of the gauge coupling in $2+1D$ gauge theory
coupled to any renormalizable system of spinor and scalar fields is zero. This
result holds both when the gauge field action is the Chern-Simons action and
when it is the topologically massive action.
