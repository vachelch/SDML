Homogeneity, Flatness and "Large" Extra Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a model in which the universe is the direct product of a
(3+1)-dimensional Friedmann, Robertson-Walker (FRW) space and a compact
hyperbolic manifold (CHM). Standard Model fields are confined to a point in the
CHM (i.e. to a brane). In such a space, the decay of massive Kaluza-Klein modes
leads to the injection of any initial bulk entropy into the observable (FRW)
universe. Both Kolmogoro-Sinai mixing due to the non-integrability of flows on
CHMs and the large statistical averaging inherent in the collapse of the
initial entropy onto the brane smooth out any initial inhomogeneities in the
distribution of matter and of 3-curvature on any slice of constant 3-position.
If, as we assume, the initial densities and curvatures in each fundamental
correlation volume are drawn from some universal underlying distributions
independent of location within the space, then these smoothing mechanisms
effectively reduce the density and curvature inhomogeneities projected onto the
FRW. This smoothing is sufficient to account for the current homogeneity and
flatness of the universe. The fundamental scale of physics can be $\gsim 1$TeV.
All relevant mass and length scales can have natural values in fundamental
units. All large dimensionless numbers, such as the entropy of the universe,
are understood as consequences of the topology of spacetime which is not
explained. No model for the origin of structure is proffered.
