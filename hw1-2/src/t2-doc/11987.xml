Universal Drinfeld-Sokolov Reduction and Matrices of Complex Size
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct affinization of the algebra $gl_{\lambda}$ of ``complex size''
matrices, that contains the algebras $\hat{gl_n}$ for integral values of the
parameter. The Drinfeld--Sokolov Hamiltonian reduction of the algebra
$\hat{gl_{\lambda}}$ results in the quadratic Gelfand--Dickey structure on the
Poisson--Lie group of all pseudodifferential operators of fractional order.
This construction is extended to the simultaneous deformation of orthogonal and
simplectic algebras that produces self-adjoint operators, and it has a
counterpart for the Toda lattices with fractional number of particles.
