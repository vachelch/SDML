Decomposing the Yang-Mills Field
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently we have proposed a set of variables for describing the physical
parameters of SU(N) Yang--Mills field. Here we propose an off-shell
generalization of our Ansatz. For this we envoke the Darboux theorem to
decompose arbitrary one-form with respect to some basis of one-forms. After a
partial gauge fixing we identify these forms with the preimages of holomorphic
and antiholomorphic forms on the coset space $ SU(N)/U(1)^{N-1}$, identified as
a particular coadjoint orbit. This yields an off-shell gauge fixed
decomposition of the Yang-Mills connection that contains our original variables
in a natural fashion.
