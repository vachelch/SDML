Characteristic Dynkin diagrams and W-algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a classification of characteristic Dynkin diagrams for the $A_N$,
$B_N$, $C_N$ and $D_N$ algebras. This classification is related to the
classification of \cw(\cg,\ck) algebras arising from non-Abelian Toda models,
and we argue that it can give new insight on the structure of $W$ algebras.
