A note on the thermodynamics of `little string' theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the thermodynamics of the D1-D5 system on a five-torus, focussing on
the roles of different scales. One can take a decoupling limit such that the
tension of the `little string' inside the fivebrane remains finite and the
physics is 5+1 dimensional. The dual black geometry exhibits a boosted Hagedorn
phase, as well as a phase describing a boosted fivebrane gas. The dependence on
the boost yields information about the nature of the fivebrane modes and their
interactions. In particular, the form of the equations of state suggests a
description in terms of $k=Q_1 Q_5$ degrees of freedom, which may lead to an
explanation of the $(Q_5)^3$ growth in the fivebrane density of states below
the Hagedorn transition.
