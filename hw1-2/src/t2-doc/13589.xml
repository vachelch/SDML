Quantization of the Chern-Simons Coupling Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the quantum consistency of p-form Maxwell-Chern-Simons
electrodynamics in 3p+2 spacetime dimensions (for p odd). These are the
dimensions where the Chern--Simons term is cubic, i.e., of the form FFA. For
the theory to be consistent at the quantum level in the presence of magnetic
and electric sources, we find that the Chern--Simons coupling constant must be
quantized. We compare our results with the bosonic sector of eleven dimensional
supergravity and find that the Chern--Simons coupling constant in that case
takes its corresponding minimal allowed value.
