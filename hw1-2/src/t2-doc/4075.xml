Zeta-Functions for Non-Minimal Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate zeta-functions $\zeta(s)$ at $s=0$ for invariant non-minimal
2nd-order vector and tensor operators defined on maximally symmetric even
dimensional spaces. We decompose the operators into their irreducible parts and
obtain their corresponding eigenvalues. Using these eigenvalues, we are able to
explicitly calculate $\zeta(0)$ for the cases of Euclidean spaces and
$N$-spheres. In the $N$-sphere case, we make use of the Euler-Maclaurin formula
to develop asymptotic expansions for the required sums. The resulting
$\zeta(0)$ values for dimensions 2 to 10 are given in the Appendix.
