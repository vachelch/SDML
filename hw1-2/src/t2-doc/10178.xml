A non-perturbative Lorentzian path integral for gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A well-defined regularized path integral for Lorentzian quantum gravity in
three and four dimensions is constructed, given in terms of a sum over
dynamically triangulated causal space-times. Each Lorentzian geometry and its
associated action have a unique Wick rotation to the Euclidean sector. All
space-time histories possess a distinguished notion of a discrete proper time.
For finite lattice volume, the associated transfer matrix is self-adjoint and
bounded. The reflection positivity of the model ensures the existence of a
well-defined Hamiltonian. The degenerate geometric phases found previously in
dynamically triangulated Euclidean gravity are not present. The phase structure
of the new Lorentzian quantum gravity model can be readily investigated by both
analytic and numerical methods.
