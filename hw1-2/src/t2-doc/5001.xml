N=4 gauged supergravity and a IIB orientifold with fluxes
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the properties of a spontaneously broken D=4, N=4 supergravity
without cosmological constant, obtained by gauging translational isometries of
its classical scalar manifold. This theory offers a suitable low energy
description of the super-Higgs phases of certain Type-IIB orientifold
compactifications with 3-form fluxes turned on. We study its N=3,2,1,0 phases
and their classical moduli spaces and we show that this theory is an example of
no-scale extended supergravity.
