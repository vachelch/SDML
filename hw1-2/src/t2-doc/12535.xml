A Model of Graceful Exit in String Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct, for the first time, a model of graceful exit transition from a
dilaton-driven inflationary phase to a decelerated Friedman-Robertson-Walker
era. Exploiting a demonstration that classical corrections can stabilize a high
curvature string phase while the evolution is still in the weakly coupled
regime, we show that if additional terms of the type that may result from
quantum corrections to the string effective action exist, and induce violation
of the null energy condition, then evolution towards a decelerated
Friedman-Robertson-Walker phase is possible. We also observe that stabilizing
the dilaton at a fixed value, either by capture in a potential minimum or by
radiation production, may require that these quantum corrections are turned
off, perhaps by non-perturbative effects or higher order contributions which
overturn the null energy condition violation.
