Discrete Torsion, AdS/CFT and duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse D-branes on orbifolds with discrete torsion, extending earlier
results. We analyze certain Abelian orbifolds of the type C^3/ \Gamma, where
\Gamma is given by Z_m x Z_n, for the most general choice of discrete torsion
parameter. By comparing with the AdS/CFT correspondence, we can consider
different geometries which give rise to the same physics. This identifies new
mirror pairs and suggests new dualities at large N. As a by-product we also get
a more geometric picture of discrete torsion.
