Gauge/string duality and scalar glueball mass ratios
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been shown by Polchinski and Strassler that the scaling of high energy
QCD scattering amplitudes can be obtained from string theory. They considered
an AdS slice as an approximation for the dual space of a confining gauge
theory. Here we use this approximation to estimate in a very simple way the
ratios of scalar glueball masses imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the
string dilaton field. These ratios are in good agreement with the results in
the literature. We also find that they do not depend on the size of the slice.
