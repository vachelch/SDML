Duality in Quantum Field Theory (and String Theory)
</title>

<abstract>
  These lectures give an introduction to duality in Quantum Field Theory. We
discuss the phases of gauge theories and the implications of the
electric-magnetic duality transformation to describe the mechanism of
confinement. We review the exact results of N=1 supersymmetric QCD and the
Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 super Yang-Mills. Some of its extensions to
String Theory are also briefly discussed.
