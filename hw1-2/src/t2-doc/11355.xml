New Brane Solutions from Killing Spinor Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  In a recent paper, we have pointed out a relation between the Killing spinor
and Einstein equations. Using this relation, new brane solutions of D=11 and
D=10 type IIB supergravity theories are constructed. It is shown that in a
brane solution, the flat world-volume directions, the smeared transverse
directions and the sphere located at a fixed radial distance can be replaced
with any Lorentzian Ricci flat, Euclidean Ricci flat and Einstein manifolds,
respectively. The solution obtained in this fashion is supersymmetric when the
Ricci flat and Einstein manifolds have Killing spinors. We generalize
intersecting brane solutions, in which M5, M2 and D3-branes also wrap over the
cycles determined by the K\"{a}hler forms of Ricci flat K\"{a}hler manifolds.
New, singular, Ricci flat manifolds as (generalized) cones over the U(1)
bundles over Ricci flat K\"{a}hler spaces are constructed. These manifolds have
covariantly constant spinors and give rise to new, supersymmetric, Ricci flat
compactifications of non-gauged supergravity theories. We find M2 and D3-brane
solutions, which asymptotically approach these singular vacua.
