On Orbifolds with Discrete Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the interpretation in classical geometry of conformal field
theories constructed from orbifolds with discrete torsion. In examples we can
analyze, these spacetimes contain ``stringy regions'' that from a classical
point of view are singularities that are to be neither resolved nor blown up.
Some of these models also give particularly simple and clear examples of mirror
symmetry.
