Non-Minimally Coupled Massive Scalar Field in a 2D Black Hole: Exactly
  Solvable Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a nonminimal massive scalar field in a 2-dimensional black hole
spacetime. We consider the black hole which is the solution of the 2d dilaton
gravity derived from string-theoretical models. We found an explicit solution
in a closed form for all modes and the Green function of the scalar field with
an arbitrary mass and a nonminimal coupling to the curvature. Greybody factors,
the Hawking radiation, and $ < \phi^2 >^{ren} $ are calculated explicitly for
this exactly solvable model.
