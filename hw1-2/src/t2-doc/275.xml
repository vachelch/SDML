Local models for intersecting brane worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the construction of configurations of D6-branes wrapped on
compact 3-cycles intersecting at points in non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds.
Such constructions provide local models of intersecting brane worlds, and
describe sectors of four-dimensional gauge theories with chiral fermions. We
present several classes of non-compact manifolds with compact 3-cycles
intersecting at points, and discuss the rules required for model building with
wrapped D6-branes. The rules to build 3-cycles are simple, and allow easy
computation of chiral spectra, RR tadpoles and the amount of preserved
supersymmetry. We present several explicit examples of these constructions,
some of which have Standard Model like gauge group and three quark-lepton
generations. In some cases, mirror symmetry relates the models to other
constructions used in phenomenological D-brane model building, like D-branes at
singularities. Some simple N=1 supersymmetric configurations may lead to
relatively tractable G_2 manifolds upon lift to M-theory, which would be
non-compact but nevertheless yield four-dimensional chiral gauge field
theories.
