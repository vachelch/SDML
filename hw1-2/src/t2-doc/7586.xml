Little String Theory in a Double Scaling Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  A double scaling limit can be defined in string theory on a Calabi-Yau (CY)
manifold by approaching a point in moduli space where the CY space develops an
isolated singularity and at the same time taking the string coupling to zero,
while keeping a particular combination of the two parameters fixed. This leads
to a decoupled theory without gravity which has a weak coupling expansion, and
can be studied using a holographically dual non-critical superstring
description. The usual ``Little String Theory'' corresponds to the strong
coupling limit of this theory. We use holography to compute two and three point
functions in weakly coupled double scaled little string theory, and study the
spectrum of the theory in various dimensions. We find a discrete spectrum of
masses which exhibits Hagedorn growth.
