Chaos, Scaling and Existence of a Continuum Limit in Classical
  Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss space-time chaos and scaling properties for classical non-Abelian
gauge fields discretized on a spatial lattice. We emphasize that there is a
``no go'' for simulating the original continuum classical gauge fields over a
long time span since there is a never ending dynamical cascading towards the
ultraviolet. We note that the temporal chaotic properties of the original
continuum gauge fields and the lattice gauge system have entirely different
scaling properties thereby emphasizing that they are entirely different
dynamical systems which have only very little in common. Considered as a
statistical system in its own right the lattice gauge system in a situation
where it has reached equilibrium comes closest to what could be termed a
``continuum limit'' in the limit of very small energies (weak non-linearities).
We discuss the lattice system both in the limit for small energies and in the
limit of high energies where we show that there is a saturation of the temporal
chaos as a pure lattice artifact. Our discussion focuses not only on the
temporal correlations but to a large extent also on the spatial correlations in
the lattice system. We argue that various conclusions of physics have been
based on monitoring the non-Abelian lattice system in regimes where the fields
are correlated over few lattice units only. This is further evidenced by
comparison with results for Abelian lattice gauge theory. How the real time
simulations of the classical lattice gauge theory may reach contact with the
real time evolution of (semi-classical aspects of) the quantum gauge theory
(e.g. Q.C.D.) is left as an important question to be further examined.
