Exotic Scalar States in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate a family of solutions of Type IIb supergravity which
asymptotically approach AdS_5 X S^5 but contain a non-constant dilaton and
volume scalar for the five-sphere. These solutions preserve an SO(1,3) X SO(6)
symmetry. We discuss the solution in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence,
and we find that as well as running coupling from the nontrivial dilaton, the
corresponding field theory has no supersymmetry and displays confinement at
least for a certain range of parameters.
