Deformation Quantization of the Heisenberg Group
</title>

<abstract>
  A *-product compatible with the comultiplication of the Hopf algebra of the
functions on the Heisenberg group is determined by deforming a coboundary
Lie-Poisson structure defined by a classical r-matrix satisfying the modified
Yang-Baxter equation. The corresponding quantum group is studied and its
R-matrix is explicitly calculated.
