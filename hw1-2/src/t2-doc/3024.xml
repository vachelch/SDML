SDLCQ: Supersymmetric Discrete Light Cone Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  In these lectures we discuss the application of discrete light cone
quantization (DLCQ) to supersymmetric field theories. We will see that it is
possible to formulate DLCQ so that supersymmetry is exactly preserved in the
discrete approximation. We call this formulation of DLCQ, SDLCQ and it combines
the power of DLCQ with all of the beauty of supersymmetry. In these lecture we
will review the application of SDLCQ to several interesting supersymmetric
theories. We will discuss two dimensional theories with (1,1), (2,2) and (8,8)
supersymmetry, zero modes, vacuum degeneracy, massless states, mass gaps,
theories in higher dimensions, and the Maldacena conjecture among other
subjects.
