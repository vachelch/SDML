Constructing the light-front QCD Hamiltonian
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose the light-front Lagrangian and the corresponding Hamiltonian that
produce a theory perturbatively equivalent to the conventional QCD in the
Lorentz coordinates after the regularization is removed. The regularization
used is nonstandard and breaks the gauge invariance. But after the
regularization is removed, this invariance is restored by the introduction of a
finite number of counterterms with coefficients dependent on the regularization
parameters.
