Matrix strings in a B-field
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the discrete light-cone quantization (DLCQ) of closed strings in the
background of Minkowski space-time and a constant Neveu-Schwarz $B$-field. For
the Bosonic string, we identify the $B$-dependent part of the thermodynamic
free energy to all orders in string perturbation theory. For every genus, $B$
appears in a constraint in the path integral which restricts the world-sheet
geometries to those which are branched covers of a certain torus. This is the
extension of a previous result where the $B$-field was absent
\cite{Grignani:2000zm}. We then discuss the coupling of a $B$-field to the
Matrix model of M-theory. We show that, when we consider this theory at finite
temperature and in a finite $B$-field, the Matrix variables are functions which
live on a torus with the same Teichm\"uller parameter as the one that we
identified in string theory. We show explicitly that the thermodynamic
partition function of the Matrix string model in the limit of free strings
reproduces the genus 1 thermodynamic partition function of type IIA string.
This is strong evidence that the Matrix model can reproduce perturbative string
theory. We also find an interesting behavior of the Hagedorn temperature.
