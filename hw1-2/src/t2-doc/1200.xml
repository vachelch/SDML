Interaction of boundaries with heterogeneous matter states in matrix
  models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study disk amplitudes whose boundary conditions on matter configurations
are not restricted to homogeneous ones. They are examined in the two-matrix
model as well as in the three-matrix model for the case of the tricritical
Ising model. Comparing these amplitudes, we demonstrate relations between
degrees of freedom of matter states in the two models. We also show that they
have a simple geometrical interpretation in terms of interactions of the
boundaries. It plays an important role that two parts of a boundary with
different matter states stick each other. We also find two closed sets of
Schwinger-Dyson equations which determine disk amplitudes in the three-matrix
model.
