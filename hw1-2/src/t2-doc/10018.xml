A HIERARCHY OF GAUGED GRASSMANIAN MODELS IN $4p$ DIMENSIONS WITH
  SELF-DUAL INSTANTONS
</title>

<abstract>
We present a hierarchy of gauged Grassmanian models in $4p$ dimensions, where
the gauge field takes its values in the $2^{2p- 1}\times 2^{2p-1}$ chiral
representation of SO(4p). The actions of all these models are absolutely
minimised by a hierarchy of self-duality equations, all of which reduce to a
single pair of coupled ordinary differential equations when subjected to $4p$
dimensional spherical symmetry.
