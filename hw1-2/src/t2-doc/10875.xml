A Note on the Picard-Fuchs Equations for N=2 Seiberg-Witten Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A concise presentation of the PF equations for N=2 Seiberg-Witten theories
for the classical groups of rank r with N_f massless hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation is provided. For N_f=0, all r PF equations can be
given in a generic form. For certain cases with N_f\neq zero, not all equations
are generic. However, in all cases there are at least r-2 generic PF equations.
For these cases the classical part of the equations is generic, while the
quantum part can be formulated using a method described in a previous paper by
the authors, which is well suited to symbolic computer calculations.
