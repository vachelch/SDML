Effective action and Hawking radiation for dilaton coupled scalars in
  two dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective one-loop action for general dilaton theories with arbitrary
dilaton-dependent measure and nonminimal coupling to scalar matter is computed.
As an application we determine the Hawking flux to infinity from black holes in
d-dimensions. We resolve the recently resurrected problem of an apparent
negative flux for nonminimally coupled scalars: For any $D \geq 4$ Black Hole
the complete flux turns out to be precisely the one of minimal coupling. This
result is obtained from a Christensen-Fulling type argument involving the
(non-)conservation of energy-momentum. It is compared with approaches using the
effective action.
