Two-Loop Quark Self-Energy in a New Formalism: (I) Overlapping
  Divergences
</title>

<abstract>
  A new integration technique for multi-loop Feynman integrals, called the
matrix method, is developed and then applied to the divergent part of the
overlapping two-loop quark self-energy function $\,i\Sigma\,$ in the light-
cone gauge. It is shown that the coefficient of the double-pole term is
strictly local, even off mass-shell, while the coefficient of the single-pole
term contains local as well as nonlocal parts. On mass-shell, the single-pole
part is local, of course. It is worth noting that the original overlapping
self-energy integral reduces eventually to 10 covariant and 38 noncovariant-
gauge integrals. We were able to verify explicitly that the divergent parts of
the 10 double covariant-gauge integrals agreed precisely with those currently
used to calculate radiative corrections in the Standard Model.
  Our new technique is amazingly powerful, being applicable to massive and
massless integrals alike, and capable of handling both covariant-gauge
integrals and the more difficult noncovariant-gauge integrals. Perhaps the most
important feature of the matrix method is the ability to execute the
$4\omega$-dimensional momentum integrations in a single operation, exactly and
in analytic form. The method works equally well for other axial-type gauges,
notably the temporal gauge ($n^2>0$) and the pure axial gauge ($n^2<0$).
