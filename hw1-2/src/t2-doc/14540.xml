New Link Invariants and Yang-Baxter Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We have new solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, from which we have
constructed new link invariants containing more than two arbitrary parameters.
This may be regarded as a generalization of the Jones' polynomial. We have also
found another simpler invariant which discriminates only the linking structure
of knots with each other, but not details of individual knot.
