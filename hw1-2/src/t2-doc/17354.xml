N=2 Supersymmetric SO(N)/Sp(N) Gauge Theories from Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the matrix model to describe the N=2 SO(N)/Sp(N) supersymmetric gauge
theories with massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. By
taking the tree level superpotential perturbation made of a polynomial of a
scalar chiral multiplet, the effective action for the eigenvalues of chiral
multiplet can be obtained. By varying this action with respect to an
eigenvalue, a loop equation is obtained. By analyzing this equation, we derive
the Seiberg-Witten curve within the context of matrix model.
