Field theory models for tachyon and gauge field string dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  In hep-th/0008227, the unstable lump solution of \phi^3 theory was shown to
have a spectrum governed by the solvable Schroedinger equation with the \ell=3
reflectionless potential and was used as a model for tachyon condensation in
string theory. In this paper we study in detail an \ell\to \infty scalar field
theory model whose lump solution mimics remarkably the string theory setup: the
original field theory tachyon and the lump tachyon have the same mass, the
spectrum of the lump consists of equally spaced infinite levels, there is no
continuous spectrum, and nothing survives after tachyon condensation. We also
find exact solutions for lumps with codimension \ge 2, and show that that their
tensions satisfy (1/(2\pi)) (T_p/ T_{p+1})=e/(\sqrt{2\pi}) \approx 1.08. We
incorporate gauge fixed couplings to a U(1) gauge field which preserve
solvability and result in massless gauge fields on the lump.
