Noncommutative String Theory, the R-Matrix, and Hopf Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the form of the noncommutative *-product in a system of open
strings and Dp-branes with constant nonzero Neveu-Schwarz 2-form, we define a
deformed multiplication operation on a quasitriangular Hopf algebra in terms of
its R-matrix, and comment on some of its properties. We show that the
noncommutative string theory *-product is a particular example of this
multiplication, and comment on other possible Hopf algebraic properties which
may underlie the theory.
