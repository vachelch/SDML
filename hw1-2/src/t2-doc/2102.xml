U-duality and Network Configurations of Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly write down the invariant supersymmetry conditions for branes
with generic values of moduli and U-duality charges in various space-time
dimensions $D \leq 10$. We then use these results to obtain new BPS states,
corresponding to network type structure of such branes.
