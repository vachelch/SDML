Covariant Quantization of d=4 Brink-Schwarz Superparticle with Lorentz
  Harmonics
</title>

<abstract>
  The first and second covariant quantization of a free massless $d=4$
superparticle with pure gauge auxiliary spinor variables have been carried out.
Arised chiral harmonic superfield corresponds to superparticle with finite
superspin and it is interpreted as Radon transformation of free massless finite
superspin superfield. A prescription for the second quantization procedure of
harmonic fields has been formulated. Microcausality is achievable only under
description of the particles by cohomology class of harmonic superfields with
integer negative homogeneity index and ordinary connection between spin and
statistics.
