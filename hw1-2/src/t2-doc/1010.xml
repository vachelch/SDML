Duality and Massive Gauge Invariant Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Two different massive gauge invariant spin-one theories in $3+1$ dimensions,
one Stuckelberg formulation and the other `$B^{\wedge}F$' theory, with
Kalb-Ramond field are shown to be related by duality. This is demonstrated by
gauging the global symmetry in the model and constraining the corresponding
dual field strength to be zero by a Lagrange multiplier, which becomes a field
in the dual theory. Implication of this equivalence to the $5$ dimensional
theories from which these theories can be obtained is discussed. The self-dual
Deser-Jackiw model in $2+1$ dimensions, is also shown to result by applying
this procedure to Maxwell-Chern-Simon theory.
