Bubbles with an O(3) Symmetric Scalar Field in Curved Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the first-order phase transition in a model of scalar field with
$O(3)$ symmetry coupled to gravity, and, in high temperature limit, discuss the
existence of new bubble solution with a global monopole at the center of the
bubble.
