Supersymmetric SO(N)/Sp(N) Gauge Theory from Matrix Model:Exact Mesonic
  Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  By performing the matrix integral over the tree level superpotential of N=1
supersymmetric SO(N)/Sp(N) gauge theories obtained from N=2 SQCD by adding the
mass term for the adjoint scalar field, the exact effective superpotential in
terms of meson field contains the nonperturbative ADS superpotential as well as
the classical tree level superpotential. By completing the meson matrix
integral with the help of saddle point equation, we find the free energy
contributions from matter part in terms of glueball field, the adjoint field
mass and quark mass. By extremizing the effective superpotential with respect
to the glueball field, we analyze the vacuum structure and describe the
behavior of two limiting cases:zero limit of quark mass and infinity limit of
adjoint field mass. We also study the magnetic theory.
