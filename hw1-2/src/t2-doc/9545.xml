Measure Fields, The Cosmological Constant and Scale Invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  The consequences of considering the measure of integration in the action to
be defined by degrees of freedom independent of the metric are studied. Models
without the cosmological constant problem, new ways of spontaneously breaking
scale symmetry which have an interesting cosmology and theories of extended
objects (string, branes) without a fundamental scale appear possible.
