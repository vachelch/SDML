Geometric Phase in Quantum Billiards with a Pointlike Scatterer
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the quantum energy levels of rectangular billiards with a
pointlike scatterer in one and two dimensions. By varying the location and the
strength of the scatterer, we systematically find diabolical degeneracies among
various levels. The associated Berry phase is illustrated, and the existence of
localized wave functions is pointed out. In one dimension, even the ground
state is shown to display the sign reversal with a mechanism to circumvent the
Sturm-Liouville theorem.
