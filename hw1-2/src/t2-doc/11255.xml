A Linear-confined Particle and the Dirac Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The model of a classical particle with the weak linear AAD potential is
subjected to path integral quantization. The light cone constraints and
peculiar properies of its internal variables permit to use in calculations
commutative dynamics and apply path integrals for a matrix form of the
transition amplitude. Quantization leads to description of a Dirac particle.
