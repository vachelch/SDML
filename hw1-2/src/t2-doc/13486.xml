Ramond-Ramond Field Radiation from Rotating Ellipsoidal Membranes
</title>

<abstract>
  We find a new stable rotator solution in D0-brane matrix mechanics. The
solution is interpreted as a D2/D0 brane bound state, constructed as a
transversely rotating ellipsoidal membrane with N D0-branes pinned over it.
  From the membrane point of view the attractive force of tension is exactly
cancelled by the repulsive centrifugal force. Dynamical properties of the
system are investigated, in particular the emission of spherical waves in the
different massless sectors of supergravity. We compute the RR 1-form
quadrupole, the RR 3-form dipole and the gravitational quadrupole radiation.
Also, we show that our non-singular classical solution is stable against small
perturbations in the initial conditions. Furthermore, we comment on a possible
fundamental particle interpretation of our system.
