Self-Dual Nonsupersymmetric Type II String Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently been proposed that certain nonsupersymmetric type II
orbifolds have vanishing perturbative contributions to the cosmological
constant. We show that techniques of Sen and Vafa allow one to construct dual
type II descriptions of these models (some of which have no weakly coupled
heterotic dual). The dual type II models are given by the same orbifolds with
the string coupling $S$ and a $T^2$ volume $T$ exchanged. This allows us to
argue that in various strongly coupled limits of the original type II models,
there are weakly coupled duals which exhibit the same perturbative
cancellations as the original models.
