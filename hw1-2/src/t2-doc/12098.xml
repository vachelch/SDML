Threefold Family of Charged Spin-1/2 Dirac Bubbles
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend Dirac's `extensible model of the electron' to include spin and
family. $U(1)_{e.m.}$ charge conservation on the bubble is translated into a
secondary $U(1)_{g}$ world-manifold gauge principle. Reflecting the secondary
magnetic monopole configuration on spatial $S^2$, the harmonic excitations may
furnish half integer $SU(2)_{spin}\otimes U(1)_{g}$ representations. Our
spin--$1/2$ `electron' is described by four world-manifold scalar fields. Its
three varieties are associated with different minima of the (6th--order)
surface-tension scalar potential.
