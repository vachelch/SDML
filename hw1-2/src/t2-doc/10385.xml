Normal Bundles, Pfaffians and Anomalies

<abstract>
  We deal with the problem of diffeomorphism anomaly in theories with branes.
In particular we thoroughly analyze the problem of the residual chiral anomaly
of a five-brane immersed in M-theory, paying attention to its global
formulation in the five-brane world-volume. We conclude that the anomaly can be
canceled by a {\it local} counterterm in the five-brane world-volume.
