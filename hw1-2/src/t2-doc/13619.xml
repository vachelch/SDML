Generalized Gaudin Models and Riccatians
</title>

<abstract>
  The systems of differential equations whose solutions coincide with Bethe
ansatz solutions of generalized Gaudin models are constructed. These equations
we call the {\it generalized spectral Riccati equations}, because the simplest
equation of this class has a standard Riccatian form. The general form of these
equations is $R_{n_i}[z_1(\lambda),\ldots, z_r(\lambda)] = c_{n_i}(\lambda), \
i=1,\ldots, r$, where $R_{n_i}$ denote some homogeneous polynomials of degrees
$n_i$ constructed from functional variables $z_i(\lambda)$ and their
derivatives. It is assumed that $\deg \partial^k z_i(\lambda) = k+1$. The
problem is to find all functions $z_i(\lambda)$ and $c_{n_i}(\lambda)$
satisfying the above equations under $2r$ additional constraints $P \
z_i(\lambda)=F_i(\lambda)$ and $(1-P) \ c_{n_i}(\lambda)=0$, where $P$ is a
projector from the space of all rational functions onto the space of rational
functions having their singularities at {\it a priori} given points. It turns
out that this problem has solutions only for very special polynomials $R_{n_i}$
called {\it Riccatians}. There exist a one-to-one correspondence between
systems of Riccatians and simple Lie algebras. Functions $c_{n_i}(\lambda)$
satisfying the system of equations constructed from Riccatians of the type
${\cal L}_r$ exactly coincide with eigenvalues of the Gaudin spectral problem
associated with algebra ${\cal L}_r$. This result suggests that the generalized
Gaudin models admit a total separation of variables.
