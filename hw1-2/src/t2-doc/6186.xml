Finite action, holographic conformal anomaly and quantum brane-worlds in
  d5 gauged supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We report our recent results concerning d5 gauged supergravity (dilatonic
gravity) considered on AdS background. The finite action on such background as
well as d4 holographic conformal anomaly (via AdS/CFT correspondence) are
found. In such formalism the bulk potential is kept to be arbitrary, dilaton
dependent function. Holographic RG in such theory is briefly discussed. d5 AdS
brane-world Universe induced by quantum effects of brane CFT is constructed.
Such brane is spherical, hyperbolic or flat one. Hence, the possibility of
quantum creation of inflationary brane-world Universe is shown.
