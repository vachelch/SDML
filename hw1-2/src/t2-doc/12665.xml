Gauge Model With Extended Field Transformations in Euclidean Space
</title>

<abstract>
  An SO(4) gauge invariant model with extended field transformations is
examined in four dimensional Euclidean space. The gauge field is
$(A^\mu)^{\alpha\beta} = 1/2 t^{\mu\nu\lambda} (M^{\nu\lambda})^{\alpha\beta}$
where $M^{\nu\lambda}$ are the SO(4) generators in the fundamental
representation. The SO(4) gauge indices also participate in the Euclidean space
SO(4) transformations giving the extended field transformations. We provide the
decomposition of the reducible field $t^{\mu\nu\lambda}$ in terms of fields
irreducible under SO(4). The SO(4) gauge transformations for the irreducible
fields mix fields of different spin. Reducible matter fields are introduced in
the form of a Dirac field in the fundamental representation of the gauge group
and its decomposition in terms of irreducible fields is also provided. The
approach is shown to be applicable also to SO(5) gauge models in five
dimensional Euclidean space.
