Global Black Branes (Extended Global Defects Surrounded by Horizons),
  Brane Worlds and the Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We study global defects coupled to higher-dimensional gravity with a negative
cosmological constant. This paper is mainly devoted to studying global black
brane solutions which are extended global defects surrounded by horizons. We
find series solutions in a few separated regions and confirm numerically that
they can be mutually connected. When the world volume of the brane is
Ricci-flat, the brane is surrounded by a degenerated horizon, while it is
surrounded by two horizons when the world volume has a positive constant
curvature. Each solution corresponds to an extremal and a non-extremal state,
respectively. Their causal structures resemble those of the
Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime. However, the
non-extremal black brane is not a static object, but an inflating brane. In
addition, we briefly discuss a brane world model in the context of the global
black branes. We comment on a few thermodynamic properties of the global black
branes, and discuss a decrease of the cosmological constant on the brane world
through the thermodynamic instability of the non-extremal global black brane.
