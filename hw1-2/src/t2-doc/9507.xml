Algebraic integrability of Schr\"odinger operators and representations
  of Lie algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study integrability and algebraic integrability properties
of certain matrix Schr\"odinger operators. More specifically, we associate such
an operator (with rational, trigonometric, or elliptic coefficients) to every
simple Lie algebra g and every representation U of this algebra with a nonzero
but finite dimensional zero weight subspace. The Calogero-Sutherland operator
is a special case of this construction. Such an operator is always integrable.
Our main result is that it is also algebraically integrable in the rational and
trigonometric case if the representation U is highest weight. This generalizes
the corresponding result for Calogero-Sutherland operators proved by Chalyh and
Vaselov. We also conjecture that this is true for the elliptic case as well,
which is a generalization of the corresponding conjecture by Chalyh and Vaselov
for Calogero-Sutherland operators.
