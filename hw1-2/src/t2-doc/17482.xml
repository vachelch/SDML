Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory Through Nilpotent Conformal
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs) through the
introduction of nilpotent conformal weights. Using this device, we derive the
properties of LCFT's such as the transformation laws, singular vectors and the
structure of correlation functions. We discuss the emergence of an extra energy
momentum tensor, which is the logarithmic partner of the energy momentum
tensor.
