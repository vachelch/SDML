Randall-Sundrum Gauge in the Brane World
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the Randall-Sundrum (RS) choice for $h_{MN}$ in the brane-world.
We begin with the de Donder gauge (transverse-tracefree) including
scalar($h_{55}$), vector($h_{5\mu}$) and tensor($h_{\mu\nu}$) in five
dimensions for comparison. One finds that $h_{55}=0$ and $h_{5\mu}=0$. This
leads to the RS choice. It appears that the RS choice is so restrictive for the
five massless states, whereas it is unique for describing the massive states.
Furthermore, one can establish the stability of the RS solution with the RS
choice only.
