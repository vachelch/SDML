Exchange statistics in 1D: from the viewpoint of exact solution
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the exchange statistics have consequences in 1D systems with
compact topology, contrary to the common opinion that exchange statistics is
arbitrary in 1D. As examples of non-trivial statistical behavior we exactly
calculate the partition function and correlators for systems of free
q-particles on compactified chains using functional integral techniques and the
supersymmetric trick. In particular we consider a spin 1/2 XY-chain with
periodic boundary conditions that corresponds to the case of q=-1.
