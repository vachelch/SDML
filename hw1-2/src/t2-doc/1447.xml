Deformation of Conifold and Intersecting Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relation between intersecting NS5-branes whose intersection is
smoothed out and the deformed conifold in terms of the supergravity solution.
We solve the condition of preserved supersymmetry on a metric inspired by the
deformed conifold metric and obtain a solution of the NS5-branes which is
delocalized except for one of the overall transverse directions. The solution
has consistent properties with other configurations obtained by string
dualities.
