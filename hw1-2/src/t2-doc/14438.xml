Duality in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  These lectures provide an introduction to the behavior of strongly-coupled
supersymmetric gauge theories. After a discussion of the effective Lagrangian
in nonsupersymmetric and supersymmetric field theories, I analyze the
qualitative behavior of the simplest illustrative models. These include
supersymmetric QCD for $N_f < N_c$, in which the superpotential is generated
nonperturbatively, N=2 SU(2) Yang-Mills theory (the Seiberg-Witten model), in
which the nonperturbative behavior of the effective coupling is described
geometrically, and supersymmetric QCD for N_f large, in which the theory
illustrates a non-Abelian generalization of electric-magnetic duality.
