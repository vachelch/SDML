Recursion Rules for Scattering Amplitudes in Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a functional derivation of recursion rules for scattering
amplitudes in a non-Abelian gauge theory in a form valid to arbitrary loop
order. The tree-level and one-loop recursion rules are explicitly displayed.
