The Lagrangian of a Self-Dual Gravitational Field as a Limit of the SDYM
  Lagrangian
</title>

<abstract>
  The action for the su(N) SDYM equations is shown to give in the limit $N \to
\infty$ the action for the six-dimensional version of the second heavenly
equation. The symmetry reductions of this latter equation to the well known
equations of self-dual gravity are given. The Moyal deformation of the heavenly
equations are also considered.
