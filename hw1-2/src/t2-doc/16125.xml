Canonical Coherent States for the Relativistic Harmonic Oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we construct manifestly covariant relativistic coherent states
on the entire complex plane which reproduce others previously introduced on a
given $SL(2,R)$ representation, once a change of variables $z\in C\rightarrow
z_D \in $ unit disk is performed. We also introduce higher-order, relativistic
creation and annihilation operators, $\C,\Cc$, with canonical commutation
relation $[\C,\Cc]=1$ rather than the covariant one $[\Z,\Zc]\approx$ Energy
and naturally associated with the $SL(2,R)$ group. The canonical (relativistic)
coherent states are then defined as eigenstates of $\C$. Finally, we construct
a canonical, minimal representation in configuration space by mean of
eigenstates of a canonical position operator.
