D-brane Actions on Kahler Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider actions for N D-branes at points in a general Kahler manifold,
which satisfy the axioms of D-geometry, and could be used as starting points
for defining Matrix theory in curved space.
  We show that the axioms cannot be satisfied unless the metric is Ricci flat,
and argue that such actions do exist when the metric is Ricci flat. This may
provide an argument for Ricci flatness in Matrix theory.
