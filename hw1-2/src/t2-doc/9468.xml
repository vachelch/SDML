On the Integrability of Classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider Model of
  $BC_{2}$ Type
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of finding most general form of the classical integrable
relativistic models of many-body interaction of the $BC_{n}$ type is
considered. In the simplest nontrivial case of $n=2$,the extra integral of
motion is presented in explicit form within the ansatz similar to the
nonrelativistic Calogero-Moser models. The resulting Hamiltonian has been found
by solving the set of two functional equations.
