Lattice Analogues of $N=2$ Superconformal Models via Quantum Group
  Truncation
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain lattice models whose continuum limits correspond to $N=2$
superconformal coset models. This is done by taking the well known vertex model
whose continuum limit is the $G \times G/G$ conformal field theory, and
twisting the transfer matrix and modifying the quantum group truncation. We
find that the natural order parameters of the new models are precisely the
chiral primary fields. The integrable perturbations of the conformal field
theory limit also have natural counterparts in the lattice formulation, and
these can be incorporated into an affine quantum group structure. The
topological, twisted $N=2$ superconformal models also have lattice analogues,
and these emerge as an intermediate part of our analysis.
