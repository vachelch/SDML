Vacuum structure of CP^N sigma models at theta=pi
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that parity symmetry is not spontaneously broken in the CP^N sigma
model for any value of N when the coefficient of the $\theta$--term becomes
$\theta=\pi$ (mod $2\pi$). The result follows from a non-perturbative analysis
of the nodal structure of the vacuum functional $\psi_0(z)$. The dynamical role
of sphalerons turns out to be very important for the argument. The result
introduces severe constraints on the possible critical behavior of the models
at $\theta=\pi$ (mod $2\pi$).
