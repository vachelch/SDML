Tachyon potentials, star products and universality
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop an efficient recursive method to evaluate the tachyon potential
using the relevant universal subalgebra of the open string star algebra. This
method, using off-shell versions of Virasoro Ward identities, avoids explicit
computation of conformal transformations of operators and does not require a
choice of background. We illustrate the procedure with a pedagogic computation
of the level six tachyon potential in an arbitrary gauge, and the evaluation of
a few simple star products. We give a background independent construction of
the so-called identity of the star algebra, and show how it fits into family of
string fields generating a commutative subalgebra.
