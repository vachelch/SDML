Chiral symmetry breaking and effective lagrangians for softly broken
  supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We study supersymmetric QCD with N_f<N_c in the limit of small
supersymmetry-breaking masses and smaller quark masses using the weak-coupling
Kahler potential. We calculate the full spectrum of this theory, which
manifests a chiral symmetry breaking pattern similar to that caused by the
strong interactions of the standard model. We derive the chiral effective
lagrangian for the pion degrees of freedom, and discuss the behavior in the
formal limit of large squark and gluino masses and for large N_c. We show that
the resulting scalings of the pion decay constant and pion masses in these
limits differ from those expected in ordinary nonsupersymmetric QCD. Although
there is no weak coupling expansion with N_f=N_c, we extend our results to this
case by constructing a superfield quantum modified constraint in the presence
of supersymmetry breaking.
