Lorentz Transformation and Light-Like Noncommutative SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that combining the spatial noncommutative SYM limit and Lorentz
transformation, one can obtain a well-behaved light-like noncommutative SYM
limit. The light-like noncommutative SYM is unitary. When the boost velocity is
finite, the resulting theory with space-time noncommutativity is unitary as
well. The light-like noncommutative SYM limit can also be approached by
combining the noncommutative open string theory limit and Lorentz
transformation. Along this line, we obtain the supergravity dual for the
light-like noncommutative SYM, which is the same as the one acquired using a
different method. As a comparison, the supergravity duals for the ordinary SYM,
spatial noncommutative SYM and the noncommutative open string theories are
given as well, in an infinitely-boosted frame with finite momentum density,
which are the decoupling limits of bound states (Dp, W), (D($p-2$), W, Dp), and
(F1, W, Dp), respectively.
