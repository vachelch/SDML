Bogomol'nyi equations in gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  By imposing self-duality conditions, we obtain the explicit form in which
gauge theories spontaneously breakdown in the Bogomol'nyi limit. In this
context, we reconsider the Abelian Higgs, Chern-Simons Higgs and
Maxwell-Chern-Simons Higgs models. On the same footing, we find a topological
Higgs potential for a Maxwell-Chern-Simons extended theory presenting both
minimal and nonminimal coupling. Finally, we perform a numerical calculation in
the asymmetric phase and show the solutions to the self-dual equations of
motion of the topological theory. We argue about certain relations among the
parameters of the model in order to obtain such vortex configurations.
