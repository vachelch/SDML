On string models with Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a general class of chiral four-dimensional string models with
Scherk--Schwarz supersymmetry breaking, involving freely acting orbifolds. The
basic ingredient is to combine an ordinary supersymmetry-preserving Z_N
projection with a supersymmetry-breaking projection Z_M' acting freely on a
subspace of the internal manifold. A crucial condition is that any generator of
the full orbifold group Z_N x Z_M' must either preserve some supersymmetry or
act freely in order to become irrelevant in some large volume limit. Tachyons
are found to be absent or limited to a given region of the tree-level moduli
space. We find several new models with orthogonal supersymmetries preserved at
distinct fixed-points. Particular attention is devoted to an interesting Z_3 x
Z_3' heterotic example.
