Symmetries of String Effective Action and Space-Time Geometry

<abstract>
  Two dimensional charged black hole solution is obtained by implementing an
$O(2,2)$ transformation on the three dimensional black string solution. Two
different monopole backgrounds in five dimensions are related through an
$O(2,2)$ transformation. It has been shown in these examples that the
particular $O(2,2)$ transformation corresponds to duality transformation.
