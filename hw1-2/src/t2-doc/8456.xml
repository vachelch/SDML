The Relation between Linear and Non-Linear $N=3,4$ Supergravity Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective actions for $d=2$, $N=3,4$ chiral supergravities with a linear
and a non-linear gauge algebra are related to each other by a quantum
reduction, the latter is obtained from the former by putting quantum currents
equal to zero. This implies that the renormalisation factors for the quantum
actions are identical.
