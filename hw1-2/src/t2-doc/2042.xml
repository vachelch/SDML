Statistics of Q-Oscillators, Quons and Relation to Fractional Satistics
</title>

<abstract>
  The statistics of $q$-oscillators, quons and to some extent, of anyons are
studied and the basic differences among these objects are pointed out. In
particular, the statistical distributions for different bosonic and fermionic
$q$-oscillators are found for their corresponding Fock space representations in
the case when the hamiltonian is identified with the number operator. In this
case and for nonrelativistic particles, the single-particle temperature Green
function is defined with $q$-deformed periodicity conditions. The equations of
state for nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic bosonic $q$-gases in an
arbitrary space dimension are found near Bose statistics, as well as the one
for an anyonic gas near Bose and Fermi statistics. The first corrections to the
second virial coefficients are also evaluated. The phenomenon of Bose-Einstein
condensation in the $q$-deformed gases is also discussed.
