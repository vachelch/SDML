N=1,2 Super-NLS Hierarchies as Super-KP Coset Reductions
</title>

<abstract>
  We define consistent finite-superfields reductions of the $N=1,2$ super-KP
hierarchies via the coset approach we already developped for reducing the
bosonic KP-hierarchy (generating e.g. the NLS hierarchy from the
$sl(2)/U(1)-{\cal KM}$ coset). We work in a manifestly supersymmetric framework
and illustrate our method by treating explicitly the $N=1,2$ super-NLS
hierarchies. W.r.t. the bosonic case the ordinary covariant derivative is now
replaced by a spinorial one containing a spin ${\textstyle {1\over 2}}$
superfield. Each coset reduction is associated to a rational super-$\cw$
algebra encoding a non-linear super-$\cw_\infty$ algebra structure. In the
$N=2$ case two conjugate sets of superLax operators, equations of motion and
infinite hamiltonians in involution are derived. Modified hierarchies are
obtained from the original ones via free-fields mappings (just as a m-NLS
equation arises by representing the $sl(2)-{\cal KM}$ algebra through the
classical Wakimoto free-fields).
