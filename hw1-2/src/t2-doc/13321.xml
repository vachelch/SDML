Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics and rotating frames
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effect of noncommutativity of space on the physics of a quantum
interferometer located in a rotating disk in a gauge field background. To this
end, we develop a path-integral approach which allows defining an effective
action from which relevant physical quantities can be computed as in the usual
commutative case. For the specific case of a constant magnetic field, we are
able to compute, exactly, the noncommutative Lagrangian and the associated
shift on the interference pattern for any value of $\theta$.
