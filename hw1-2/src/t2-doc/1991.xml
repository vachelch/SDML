Recursive Graphical Construction of Tadpole-Free Feynman Diagrams and
  Their Weights in phi^4-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We review different approaches to the graphical generation of the
tadpole-free Feynman diagrams of the self-energy and the one-particle
irreducible four-point function. These are needed for calculating the critical
exponents of the euclidean multicomponent scalar phi^4-theory with
renormalization techniques in d=4-epsilon dimensions.
