Strings and D-Branes with Boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  The covariant field equations of ten-dimensional super D-branes are obtained
by considering fundamental strings whose ends lie in the superworldsurface of
the D-brane. By considering in a similar fashion Dp-branes ending on
D(p+2)-branes we derive equations describing D-branes with dual potentials, as
well as the vector potentials.
