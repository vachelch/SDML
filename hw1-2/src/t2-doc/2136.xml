Short Distance Contributions to Graviton-Graviton Scattering: Matrix
  Theory versus Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study graviton scattering in the presence of higher dimensional operators
- particularly, R^4 - arising from loop effects. We find that the results do
not correspond to any known terms in the effective action of Matrix Theory,
thus lending support to the idea that the finite N Matrix Theory has no simple
relation to supergravity with large compactification radii.
