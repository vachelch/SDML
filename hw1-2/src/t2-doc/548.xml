The non-commutative Landau problem
</title>

<abstract>
  The Landau problem is discussed in two similar but still different
non-commutative frameworks. The ``standard'' one, where the coupling to the
gauge field is achieved using Poisson brackets, yields all Landau levels. The
``exotic'' approach, where the coupling to the gauge field is achieved using
the symplectic structure, only yields lowest-Landau level states, as advocated
by Peierls and used in the description of the ground states of the Fractional
Quantum Hall Effect. The same reduced model also describes vortex dynamics in a
superfluid ${}^4$He film. Remarkably, the spectrum depends crucially on the
quantization scheme. The system is symmetric w. r. t. area-preserving
diffeomorphisms.
