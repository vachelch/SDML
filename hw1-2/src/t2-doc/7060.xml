(2,0)-supersymmetric sigma models and almost complex structures
</title>

<abstract>
We find a new class of (2,0)-supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models with
torsion and target spaces almost complex manifolds extending similar results
for models with (2,2) supersymmetry. These models are invariant under a new
symmetry which is generated by a Noether charge of Lorentz weight one and it is
associated to the Nijenhuis tensor of the almost complex structure of the sigma
model target manifold. We compute the Poisson bracket algebra of charges of the
above (2,0)-and (2,2)-supersymmetric sigma models and show that it closes but
it is not isomorphic to the standard (2,0) and (2,2) supersymmetry algebra,
respectively. Examples of such (2,0)- and (2,2)-supersymmetric sigma models
with target spaces group manifolds are also given. In addition, we study the
quantisation of the (2,0)-supersymmetric sigma models, compute the anomalies of
their classical symmetries and examine their cancellation. Furthermore, we
examine the massive extension of (2,0)-supersymmetric sigma models with target
spaces almost complex manifolds, and study the topological twist of the new
supersymmetry algebras.
