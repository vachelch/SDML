Twisted N=4 SUSY Algebra in Topological Models of Schwarz Type
</title>

<abstract>
  We reinvestigate the twisted N=4 supersymmetry present in Schwarz type
topological field models. We show that Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions
can be untwisted to a kind of sigma-model with reversed statistics only in the
free case. By dimensional reduction we define then the two-dimensional
BF-model. We establish an analog result concerning the untwisting. As a
consequence of the definition through dimensional reduction we find new
fermionic scalar symmetries that have been overlooked so far in the literature.
