Matrix Ernst potentials for EMDA with multiple vector fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion system with multiple vector
fields (bosonic sector of the D=4, N=4 supergravity) restricted to spacetimes
possessing a non-null Killing vector field admits a concise representation in
terms of the Ernst-type matrix valued potentials. A constructive derivation of
the SWIP solutions is given and a colliding waves counterpart of the DARN-NUT
solution is obtained. SU(m,m) chiral representation of the two-dimensionally
reduced system is derived and the corresponding Kramer-Neugebauer-type map is
presented.
