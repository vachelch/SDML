Non-perturbative Supersymmetry Breaking and Finite Temperature
  Instabilities in N=4 Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the non-perturbative effective potential for the dual
five-dimensional N=4 strings in the context of finite-temperature regarded as a
breaking of supersymmetry into four space-time dimensions. Using the properties
of gauged N=4 supergravity we derive the universal thermal effective potential
describing all possible high-temperature instabilities of the known N=4
superstrings. These strings undergo a high-temperature transition to a new
phase in which five-branes condense. This phase is described in detail, using
both the effective supergravity and non-critical string theory in six
dimensions. In the new phase, supersymmetry is perturbatively restored but
broken at the non-perturbative level.
