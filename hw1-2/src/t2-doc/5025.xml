Spinon Bases, Yangian Symmetry and Fermionic Representations of Virasoro
  Characters in Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the description of the $SU(2)$, level $k=1$, Wess-Zumino-Witten
conformal field theory in terms of the modes of the spin-1/2 affine primary
field $\phi^\alpha$. These are shown to satisfy generalized `canonical
commutation relations', which we use to construct a basis of Hilbert space in
terms of representations of the Yangian $Y(sl_2)$. Using this description, we
explicitly derive so-called `fermionic representations' of the Virasoro
characters, which were first conjectured by Kedem et al.~\cite{kedem}. We point
out that similar results are expected for a wide class of rational conformal
field theories.
