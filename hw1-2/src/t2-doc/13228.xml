M-Theory Moduli Space and Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We conduct a systematic search for a viable string/M-theory cosmology,
focusing on cosmologies that include an era of slow-roll inflation, after which
the moduli are stabilized and the Universe is in a state with an acceptably
small cosmological constant. We observe that the duality relations between
different cosmological backgrounds of string/M-theory moduli space are greatly
simplified, and that this simplification leads to a truncated moduli space
within which possible cosmological solutions lie. We review some known
challenges to four dimensional models in the "outer", perturbative, region of
moduli space, and use duality relations to extend them to models of all of the
(compactified) perturbative string theories and 11D supergravity, including
brane world models. We conclude that cosmologies restricted to the outer region
are not viable, and that the most likely region of moduli space in which to
find realistic cosmology is the "central", non-perturbative region, with
coupling and compact volume both of order unity, in string units.
