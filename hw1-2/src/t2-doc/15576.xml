Supersymmetric Sum Rules for Electromagnetic Multipoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive model independent, non-perturbative supersymmetric sum rules for
the magnetic and electric multipole moments of any theory with N=1
supersymmetry. We find that in any irreducible N=1 supermultiplet the diagonal
matrix elements of the l-multipole moments are completely fixed in terms of
their off-diagonal matrix elements and the diagonal (l-1)-multipole moments.
