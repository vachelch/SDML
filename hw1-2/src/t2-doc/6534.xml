Generalized Poisson structures
</title>

<abstract>
  New generalized Poisson structures are introduced by using skew-symmetric
contravariant tensors of even order. The corresponding `Jacobi identities' are
given by the vanishing of the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. As an example, we
provide the linear generalized Poisson structures which can be constructed on
the dual spaces of simple Lie algebras.
