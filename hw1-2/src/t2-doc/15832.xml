A mass hierarchy from recoiling D branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Using conformal field theory methods we construct a metric that describes the
distortion of space-time surrounding a D(irichlet)-brane (solitonic) defect
after being struck by another D-brane. By viewing our four-dimensional universe
as such a struck brane, embedded in a five-dimensional space-time, we argue on
the appearance of a band of massive Kaluza-Klein excitations for the bulk
graviton which is localized in a region of the fifth dimension determined by
the inverse size of the band. The band incorporates the massless mode (ordinary
graviton) and its thickness is determined essentially by the width of the
Gaussian distribution describing the (target-space) quantum fluctuations of the
intersecting-brane configuration.
