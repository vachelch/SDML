Inside an Enhancon: Monopoles and Dual Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study wrapped brane configurations that give rise to three
dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory with eight supercharges. The corresponding
supergravity solution is singular and it was conjectured that the singularity
is removed by an enhancon mechanism. Instead, we incorporate non-perturbative
gauge fields into supergravity and find a smooth solution for these
configurations. Along the way we derive a non-abelian supergravity Lagrangian
for type IIA on K3 and explicit formulae for the toroidal reduction of the
heterotic string with non-abelian gauge fields. We proceed to analyse the
duality with Yang-Mills theory and find that the dual background is a monopole
configuration in little string theory.
