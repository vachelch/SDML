Braided Hopf Algebras and Differential Calculus
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the algebra of the bicovariant differential calculus on a
quantum group can be understood as a projection of the cross product between a
braided Hopf algebra and the quantum double of the quantum group. The resulting
super-Hopf algebra can be reproduced by extending the exterior derivative to
tensor products.
