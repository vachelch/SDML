Asymptotic properties of the solutions of a differential equation
  appearing in QCD

<abstract>
  We establish the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio $h^\prime(0)/h(0)$ for
$\lambda\rightarrow\infty$, where $h(r)$ is a solution, vanishing at infinity,
of the differential equation $h^{\prime\prime}(r) = i\lambda \omega (r) h(r)$
on the domain $0 \leq r <\infty$ and $\omega (r) = (1-\sqrt{r}
K_1(\sqrt{r}))/r$. Some results are valid for more general $\omega$'s.
