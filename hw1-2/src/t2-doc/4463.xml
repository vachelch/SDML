Riemann-Einstein Structure from Volume and Gauge Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how a metric structure can be induced in a simple way starting
with a gauge structure and a preferred volume, by spontaneous symmetry
breaking. A polynomial action, including coupling to matter, is constructed for
the symmetric phase. It is argued that assuming a preferred volume, in the
context of a metric theory, induces only a limited modification of the theory.
