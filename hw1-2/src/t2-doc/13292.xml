Rotating Intersecting M-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present intersecting p-brane solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity
(M-branes) which upon toroidal compactification reduce to non-extreme
``rotating'' black holes. We identify harmonic functions, associated with each
M-brane, and non-extremality functions, specifying a deviation from the BPS
limit. These functions are modified due to the angular momentum parameters,
which specify the rotation along the transverse directions of the M-branes. We
spell out the intersection rules for the eleven-dimensional space-time metric
for intersecting (up to three) rotating M-brane configurations (and a boost
along the common intersecting direction).
