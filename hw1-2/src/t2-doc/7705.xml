General structure of the photon self-energy in non-commutative QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the behavior of the photon two point function, in non-commutative
QED, in a general covariant gauge and in arbitrary space-time dimensions. We
show, to all orders, that the photon self-energy is transverse. Using an
appropriate extension of the dimensional regularization method, we evaluate the
one-loop corrections, which show that the theory is renormalizable. We also
prove, to all orders, that the poles of the photon propagator are gauge
independent and briefly discuss some other related aspects.
