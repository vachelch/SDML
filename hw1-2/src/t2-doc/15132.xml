Fusion of \ade Lattice Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Fusion hierarchies of \ade face models are constructed. The fused critical
$D$, $E$ and elliptic $D$ models yield new solutions of the Yang-Baxter
equations with bond variables on the edges of faces in addition to the spin
variables on the corners. It is shown directly that the row transfer matrices
of the fused models satisfy special functional equations. Intertwiners between
the fused \ade models are constructed by fusing the cells that intertwine the
elementary face weights. As an example, we calculate explicitly the fused
$2\times 2$ face weights of the 3-state Potts model associated with the $D_4$
diagram as well as the fused intertwiner cells for the $A_5$--$D_4$
intertwiner. Remarkably, this $2\times 2$ fusion yields the face weights of
both the Ising model and 3-state CSOS models.
