< phi^2 > for a scalar field in 2D black holes: a new uniform
  approximation
</title>

<abstract>
  We study nonconformal quantum scalar fields and averages of their local
observables (such as <phi^2>^{ren} and T_{ab}^{ren}) in a spacetime of a
2-dimensional black hole. In order to get an analytical approximation for these
expressions the WKB approximation is often used. We demonstrate that at the
horizon WKB approximation is violated for a nonconformal field, that is when
the field mass or/and the parameter of non-minimal coupling do not vanish. We
propose a new "uniform approximation" which solves this problem. We use this
approximation to obtain an improved analytical approximation for <phi^2>^{ren}
in the 2-dimensional black hole geometry. We compare the obtained results with
numerical calculations.
