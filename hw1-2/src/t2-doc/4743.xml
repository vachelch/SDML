Exact Renormalization Group Equations. An Introductory Review
</title>

<abstract>
  We critically review the use of the exact renormalization group equations
(ERGE) in the framework of the scalar theory. We lay emphasis on the existence
of different versions of the ERGE and on an approximation method to solve it:
the derivative expansion. The leading order of this expansion appears as an
excellent textbook example to underline the nonperturbative features of the
Wilson renormalization group theory. We limit ourselves to the consideration of
the scalar field (this is why it is an introductory review) but the reader will
find (at the end of the review) a set of references to existing studies on more
complex systems.
