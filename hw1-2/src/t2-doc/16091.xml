The Lattice Dynamics of Completely Entangled States and its Application
  to Communication Schemes
</title>

<abstract>
  (Presented at conference on Fundamental Problems in Physics - UMBC - June
1994) It is shown that among the orthogonal sets of EPR (completely entangled)
states there is a unique basis (up to equivalence) that is a also a perfectly
resolved set of coherent states with respect to a pair of complementary
observables. This basis defines a lattice phase space in which quadratic
Hamiltonians constructed from the observables induce site-to-site hopping at
discrete time intervals. When recently suggested communication
schemes\cite{BENa} are adapted to the lattice they are greatly enhanced,
because the finite Heisenberg group structure allows dynamic generation of
signal sequences using the quadratic Hamiltonians. We anticipate the
possibility of interferometry by determining the relative phases between
successive signals produced by the simplest Hamiltonians of this type, and we
show that they exhibit a remarkable pattern determined by the number-theoretic
Legendre symbol.
