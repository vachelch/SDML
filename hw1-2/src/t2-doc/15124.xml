Consistent Interactions between Gauge Fields and Local BRST Cohomology :
  The Example of Yang-Mills Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent results on the cohomological reformulation of the problem of
consistent interactions between gauge fields are illustrated in the case of the
Yang-Mills models. By evaluating the local BRST cohomology through descent
equation techniques, it is shown (i) that there is a unique local, Poincar\'e
invariant cubic vertex for free gauge vector fields which preserves the number
of gauge symmetries to first order in the coupling constant; and (ii) that
consistency to second order in the coupling constant requires the structure
constants appearing in the cubic vertex to fulfill the Jacobi identity. The
known uniqueness of the Yang-Mills coupling is therefore rederived through
cohomological arguments.
