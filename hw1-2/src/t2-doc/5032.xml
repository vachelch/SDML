Effective Superpotentials via Konishi Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  We use Ward identities derived from the generalized Konishi anomaly in order
to compute effective superpotentials for SU(N), SO(N) and $Sp(N)$
supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to matter in various representations. In
particular we focus on cubic and quartic tree level superpotentials. With this
technique higher order corrections to the perturbative part of the effective
superpotential can be easily evaluated.
