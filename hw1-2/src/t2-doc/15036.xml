D-brane Dynamics and the Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the recently proposed D-brane configuration [hep-th/0010105]
modeling the quantum Hall effect, focusing on the nature of the interactions
between the charged particles. Our analysis indicates that the interaction is
repulsive, which it should be for the ground state of the system to behave as a
quantum Hall liquid. The strength of interactions varies inversely with the
filling fraction, leading us to conclude that a Wigner crystal is the ground
state at small nu. For larger rational nu (still less than unity), it is
reasonable to expect a fractional quantum Hall ground state.
