Six-body Light-Front Tamm-Dancoff approximation and wave functions for
  the massive Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  The spectrum of the massive Schwinger model in the strong coupling region is
obtained by using the light-front Tamm-Dancoff (LFTD) approximation up to
including six-body states. We numerically confirm that the two-meson bound
state has a negligibly small six-body component. Emphasis is on the usefulness
of the information about states (wave functions). It is used for identifying
the three-meson bound state among the states below the three-meson threshold.
We also show that the two-meson bound state is well described by the wave
function of the relative motion.
