Generalized BRST Quantization and Massive Vector Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  A previously proposed generalized BRST quantization on inner product spaces
for second class constraints is further developed through applications. This
BRST method involves a conserved generalized BRST charge Q which is not
nilpotent but which satisfies Q=\delta+\delta^{\dagger}, \delta^2=0, and by
means of which physical states are obtained from the projection
\delta|ph>=\delta^{\dagger}|ph>=0. A simple model is analyzed in detail from
which some basic properties and necessary ingredients are extracted. The method
is then applied to a massive vector field. An effective theory is derived which
is close to the one of the Stueckelberg model. However, since the scalar field
here is introduced in order to have inner product solutions, a massive
Yang-Mills theory with polynomial interaction terms might be possible to
construct.
