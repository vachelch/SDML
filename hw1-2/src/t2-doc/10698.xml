On some new warped brane world solutions in higher dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We present new solutions of higher dimensional Einstein's equations with a
cosmological constant that localize gravity on branes which are transverse to
Ricci-flat manifolds or to homogeneous spaces with topologically non-trivial
solutions of gauge field equations. These solutions are relevant for the
localization of chiral fermions on a brane.
