Two and Three-Dimensional Spin Systems with Gonihedric Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform numerical simulations of the two and three-dimensional spin
systems with competing interaction. They describe the model of random surfaces
with linear-gonihedric action.The degeneracy of the vacuum state of this spin
system is equal to $~~d \cdot 2^{N}~~$ for the lattice of the size $~N^{d}~$.
We observe the second order phase transition of the three-dimensional system,
at temperature $\beta_{c} \simeq 0.43932$ which almost coincides with
$\beta_{c}$ of the 2D Ising model. This confirms the earlier analytical result
for the case when self-interaction coupling constant $k$ is equal to zero. We
suggest the full set of order parameters which characterize the structure of
the vacuum states and of the phase transition.
