D-branes on Noncommutative Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study tachyon condensation on noncommutative toric orbifolds with a $Z_2$
discrete group and explore the various kins of brane bound states arising in
the case of irrational values of the B-field. We show that $Z_$ symmetry of the
orbifolds incorporates naturally anti-branes in the spectrum and leads to
equivalent results as those obtained by starting from an original pair of
D-barD system on quantum torii. A specific analysis is deserved to the
irrational representation of NC orbifolds and to the unstable bound states
generated by the condensation.
