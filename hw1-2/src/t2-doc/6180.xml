Fermion doubling problem and noncommutative geometry II
</title>

<abstract>
  In our previous paper (hep-th/9911087), we proposed a resolution for the
fermion doubling problem in discrete field theories based on the fuzzy sphere
and its cartesian products. In this paper after a review of that work, we bring
out its relationship to the Ginsparg-Wilson approach.
