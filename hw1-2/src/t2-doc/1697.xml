(Super)Oscillator on CP(N) and Constant Magnetic Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We define the "maximally integrable" isotropic oscillator on CP(N) and
discuss its various properties, in particular, the behaviour of the system with
respect to a constant magnetic field. We show that the properties of the
oscillator on CP(N) qualitatively differ in the N>1 and N=1 cases. In the
former case we construct the ``axially symmetric'' system which is locally
equivalent to the oscillator. We perform the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel
transformation of the oscillator on CP(2) and construct some generalized
MIC-Kepler problem. We also define a N=2 superextension of the oscillator on
CP(N) and show that for N>1 the inclusion of a constant magnetic field
preserves the supersymmetry of the system.
