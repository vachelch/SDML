Hagedorn Behavior of Little String Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the Hagedorn behavior of little string theory using its
conjectured duality with near-horizon NS5-branes. In particular, by studying
the string-corrected NS5-brane supergravity solution, it is shown that
tree-level corrections to the temperature vanish, while the leading one-loop
string correction generates the correct temperature dependence of the entropy
near the Hagedorn temperature. Finally, the Hagedorn behavior of ODp-brane
theories, which are deformed versions of little string theory, is considered
via their supergravity duals.
