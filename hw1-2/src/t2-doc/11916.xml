Duality in Superstring Compactifications with Magnetic Field Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the work of Polchinski and Strominger on type IIA theory, where
the effect of non-trivial field strengths for p-form potentials on a Calabi-Yau
space was discussed, we study four-dimensional heterotic string theory in the
presence of magnetic field on a 2-cycle in the internal manifold, for both N=4
and N=2 cases. We show that at special points in the moduli space, certain
perturbative charged states become tachyonic and stabilize the vacuum by
acquiring vacuum expectation values, thereby restoring supersymmetry. We
discuss both the cases where the tachyons appear with a tower of Landau levels,
which become light in the limit of large volume of the 2-cycle, and the case
where such Landau levels are not present. In the latter case it is sufficient
to restrict the analysis to the quartic potential for the tachyon. On the other
hand, in the former case it is necessary to include the Landau levels in the
analysis of the potential; for toroidal and orbifold examples, we give an
explicit CFT description of the new supersymmetric vacuum. The resulting new
vacuum turns out to be in the same class as the original supersymmetric one.
Finally, using duality, we discuss the role of the Landau levels on the type
IIA side.
