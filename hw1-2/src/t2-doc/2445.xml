Predictability and Semiclassical Approximation at the onset of Black
  Hole formation
</title>

<abstract>
  We combine analytical and numerical techniques to study the collapse of
conformally coupled massless scalar fields in semiclassical 2D dilaton gravity,
with emphasis on solutions just below criticality when a black hole almost
forms. We study classical information and quantum correlations. We show
explicitly how recovery of information encoded in the classical initial data
from the outgoing classical radiation becomes more difficult as criticality is
approached. The outgoing quantum radiation consists of a positive-energy flux,
which is essentially the standard Hawking radiation, followed by a
negative-energy flux which ensures energy conservation and guarantees unitary
evolution through strong correlations with the positive-energy Hawking
radiation. As one reaches the critical solution there is a breakdown of
unitarity. We show that this breakdown of predictability is intimately related
to a breakdown of the semiclassical approximation.
