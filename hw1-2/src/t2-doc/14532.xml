The many faces of OSp(1|32)

<abstract>
  We show that the complete superalgebra of symmetries, including central
charges, that underlies F-theories, M-theories and type II string theories in
dimensions 12, 11 and 10 of various signatures correspond to rewriting of the
same OSp(1|32) algebra in different covariant ways. One only has to distinguish
the complex and the unique real algebra. We develop a common framework to
discuss all signatures theories by starting from the complex form of OSp(1|32).
Theories are distinguished by the choice of basis for this algebra. We
formulate dimensional reductions and dualities as changes of basis of the
algebra. A second ingredient is the choice of a real form corresponding to a
specific signature. The existence of the real form of the algebra selects
preferred spacetime signatures. In particular, we show how the real d=10 IIA
and IIB superalgebras for various signatures are related by generalized
T-duality transformations that not only involve spacelike but also timelike
directions. A third essential ingredient is that the translation generator in
one theory plays the role of a central charge operator in the other theory. The
identification of the translation generator in these algebras leads to the star
algebras of Hull, which are characterized by the fact that the positive
definite energy operator is not part of the translation generators. We apply
our results to discuss different T-dual pictures of the D-instanton solution of
Euclidean IIB supergravity.
