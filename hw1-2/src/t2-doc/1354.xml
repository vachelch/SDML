Superpotentials of N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories from M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider brane configurations in M-theory describing N=1 supersymmetric
gauge theories and using the parametric representation of the brane
configurations, we calculate the superpotentials for various cases including
multiple gauge groups or fermions. For SU(n) N=1 SQCD with $N_f$ fermion case
($N_f < N_c)$, we find that the superpotential from M-theory and the gauge
theory agree precisely. This gives a direct evidence of the validity of
Witten's M-theory method for calculating the super potential.
