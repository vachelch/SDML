D-Brane Scattering of N=2 Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The amplitudes for emission and scattering of N=2 strings off D-branes are
calculated. We consider in detail the amplitudes <cc> and <occ> for the
different types of D-branes. For some D-branes we find massive poles in the
scattering spectrum that are absent in the ordinary N=2 spectrum.
