Closed universes can satisfy the holographic principle in three
  dimensions

  We examine in details Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models in 2+1 dimensions in
order to investigate the cosmic holographic principle suggested by Fischler and
Susskind. Our results are rigorously derived differing from the previous one
found by Wang and Abdalla. We discuss the erroneous assumptions done in this
work. The matter content of the models is composed of a perfect fluid, with a
$\gamma$-law equation of state. We found that closed universes satisfy the
holographic principle only for exotic matter with a negative pressure. We also
analyze the case of a collapsing flat universe.
