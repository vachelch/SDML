Confining String with Topological Term
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider several aspects of `confining strings', recently proposed to
describe the confining phase of gauge field theories.
 We perform the exact duality transformation that leads to the confining string
action and show that it reduces to the Polyakov action in the semiclassical
approximation. In 4D we introduce a `$\theta$-term' and compute the low-energy
effective action for the confining string in a derivative expansion. We find
that the coefficient of the extrinsic curvature (stiffness) is negative,
confirming previous proposals. In the absence of a $\theta$-term, the effective
string action is only a cut-off theory for finite values of the coupling e,
whereas for generic values of $\theta$, the action can be renormalized and to
leading order we obtain the Nambu-Goto action plus a topological `spin' term
that could stabilize the system.
