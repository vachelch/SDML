A New Fractional D2-brane, G_2 Holonomy and T-duality
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, a new example of a complete non-compact Ricci-flat metric of G_2
holonomy was constructed, which has an asymptotically locally conical structure
at infinity with a circular direction whose radius stabilises. In this paper we
find a regular harmonic 3-form in this metric, which we then use in order to
obtain an explicit solution for a fractional D2-brane configuration. By
performing a T-duality transformation on the stabilised circle, we obtain the
type IIB description of the fractional brane, which now corresponds to D3-brane
with one of its world-volume directions wrapped around the circle.
