Topological Landau-Ginzburg Model of Two-Dimensional String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a topological Landau-Ginzburg model with superpotential W(X)=X^{-1}.
This is argued to be equivalent to c=1 string theory compactified at the
self-dual radius. We compute the tree-level correlation function of N tachyons
in this theory and show their agreement with matrix-model results. We also
discuss the nature of contact terms, the perturbed superpotential and the flow
of operators in the small phase space. The role of gravitational descendants in
this theory is examined, and the tachyon two-point function in genus 1 is
obtained using a conjectured modification of the gravitational recursion
relations.
