Explicit Relation of Quantum Hall Effect and Calogero-Sutherland Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Explicit relation between Laughlin state of the quantum Hall effect and
one-dimensional(1D) model with long-ranged interaction ($1/r^2$) is discussed.
By rewriting lowest Landau level wave functions in terms of 1D representation,
Laughlin state can be written as a deformation of the ground state of
Calogero-Sutherland model. Corresponding to Laughlin state on different
geometries, different types of 1D $1/r^2$ interaction models are derived.
