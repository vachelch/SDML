Supersymmetric Bianchi class A models
</title>

<abstract>
  The canonical theory of $N=1$ supergravity is applied to Bianchi class A
spatially homogeneous cosmologies. The full set of quantum constraints are then
solved with the possible ordering ambiguity taken into account by introducing a
free parameter. The wave functions are explicitly given for all the Bianchi
class A models in a unified way. Some comments are made on the Bianchi type IX
cases.
