A Third-Quantized Approach to the Large-N Field Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Large-N field systems are considered from an unusual point of view. The
Hamiltonian is presented in a third-quantized form analogously to the
second-quantized formulation of the quantum theory of many particles. The
semiclassical approximation is applied to the third-quantized Hamiltonian. The
advantages of this approach in comparison with 1/N-expansion are discussed.
