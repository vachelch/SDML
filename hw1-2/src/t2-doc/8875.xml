3-D Interacting CFTs and Generalized Higgs Phenomenon in Higher Spin
  Theories on AdS
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a duality, recently conjectured by Klebanov and Polyakov, between
higher-spin theories on AdS_4 and O(N) vector models in 3-d. These theories are
free in the UV and interacting in the IR. At the UV fixed point, the O(N) model
has an infinite number of higher-spin conserved currents. In the IR, these
currents are no longer conserved for spin s>2. In this paper, we show that the
dual interpretation of this fact is that all fields of spin s>2 in AdS_4 become
massive by a Higgs mechanism, that leaves the spin-2 field massless. We
identify the Higgs field and show how it relates to the RG flow connecting the
two CFTs, which is induced by a double trace deformation.
