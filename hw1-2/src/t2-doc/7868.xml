  N=2 -> N=1

  We show the existence of a supersymmetry breaking mechanism in string theory,
where N=4 supersymmetry is broken spontaneously to N=2 and N=1 with moduli
dependent gravitino masses. The spectrum of the spontaneously broken theory
with lower supersymmetry is in one-to-one correspondence with the spectrum of
the heterotic N=4 string. The mass splitting of the N=4 spectrum depends on the
compactification moduli as well as the three R-symmetry charges. We also show
that, in string theory, chiral theories can be obtained after spontaneous
breaking of extended supersymmetry. This was impossible at the level of field
theory. In the large moduli limit a restoration of the N=4 supersymmetry is
obtained. As expected the graviphotons and some of the gauge bosons become
massive in N=1 vacua. At some special points of the moduli space some of the
N=4 states with non-zero winding numbers and with spin 0 and {1/2} become
massless chiral superfields of the unbroken N=1 supersymmetry. Such vaccua have
a dual type II description, in which there are magnetically charged states with
spin 0 and {1/2} that become massless. The heterotic-type II duality suggests
some novel non-perturbative transitions on the type II side. Such transitions
do not seem to have a geometric interpretation, since they relate type II
vaccua with symmetric worlsheet structure to assymetric ones. The heteroric
interpretation of such a transition is an ordinary Higgsing of an SU(2) factor.
In the case of N=4 --> N=2, the perturbative N=2 prepotential is determined by
the perturbative N=4 BPS states. This observation let us to suggest a method
which determines the exact non-perturbative prepotential of the effective N=2
supergravity using the shifted spectrum of the non-perturbative BPS states of
the underlying N=4 theory.
