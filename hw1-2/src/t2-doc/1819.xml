Non-Perturbative Properties of Heterotic String Vacua Compactified on
  ${K3\times T^2}$
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the heterotic--type II duality of $N=2$ string vacua in four space-time
dimensions we study non-perturbative couplings of toroidally compactified
six-dimensional heterotic vacua. In particular, the heterotic--heterotic
$S$-duality and the Coulomb branch of tensor multiplets observed in six
dimensions are studied from a four-dimensional point of view. We explicitly
compute the couplings of the vector multiplets of several type II vacua and
investigate the implications for their heterotic duals.
