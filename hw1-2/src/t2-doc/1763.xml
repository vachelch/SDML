Anomaly and Exotic Statistics in One Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
We study the influence of the anomaly on the physical quantum picture of the
chiral Schwinger model (CSM) defined on $S^1$. We show that such phenomena as
the total screening of charges and the dynamical mass generation characteristic
for the standard Schwinger model do not take place here. Instead of them, the
anomaly results in the background linearly rising electric field or,
equivalently, in the exotic statistics of the physical matter field. We
construct the algebra of the Poincare generators and show that it differs from
the Poincare one. For the CSM on $R^1$, the anomaly influences only the mass
generation mechanism.
