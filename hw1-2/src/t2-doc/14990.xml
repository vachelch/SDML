Universal Calabi-Yau Algebra: Towards an Unification of Complex Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a universal normal algebra suitable for constructing and
classifying Calabi-Yau spaces in arbitrary dimensions. This algebraic approach
includes natural extensions of reflexive weight vectors to higher dimensions,
related to Batyrev's reflexive polyhedra, and their n-ary combinations. It also
includes a `dual' construction based on the Diophantine decomposition of
invariant monomials, which provides explicit recurrence formulae for the
numbers of Calabi-Yau spaces in arbitrary dimensions with Weierstrass, K3,
etc., fibrations. Our approach also yields simple algebraic relations between
chains of Calabi-Yau spaces in different dimensions, and concrete
visualizations of their singularities related to Cartan-Lie algebras. This
Universal Calabi-Yau Algebra is a powerful tool for decyphering the Calabi-Yau
genome in all dimensions.
