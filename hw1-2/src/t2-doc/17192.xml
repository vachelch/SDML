Yangians and Gelfand-Zetlin bases
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish a relationship between the modern theory of Yangians and the
classical construction of the Gelfand-Zetlin bases for the complex Lie algebra
$\gn$. Our approach allows us to produce the $q$-analogues of the
Gelfand-Zetlin formulae in a straightforward way.
