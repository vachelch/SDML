Counting Supershort Supermultiplets
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider multiplet shortening for BPS solitons in N=1 two-dimensional
models. Examples of the single-state multiplets were established previously in
N=1 Landau-Ginzburg models. The shortening comes at a price of loosing the
fermion parity $(-1)^F$ due to boundary effects. This implies the disappearance
of the boson-fermion classification resulting in abnormal statistics. To count
such short multiplets we introduce a new index. We consider the phenomenon of
shortening in a broad class of hybrid models which extend the Landau-Ginzburg
models to include a nonflat metric on the target space. Our index turns out to
be related to the index of the Dirac operator on the soliton moduli space. The
latter vanishes in most cases implying the absence of shortening. We also
generalize the anomaly in the central charge to take into account the target
space metric.
