Casimir stress for cylindrical shell in de-Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  The Casimir stress on cylinderical shell in de Sitter background for massless
scalar field satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions on the cylinder is
calculated. The metric is written in conformally flat form to make maximum use
of the Minkowski space calculations. Different cosmological constants are
assumed for the space inside and outside the cylinder to have general results
applicable to the case of cylindrical domain wall formations in the early
universe.
