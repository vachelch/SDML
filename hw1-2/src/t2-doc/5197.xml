Mesonic Spectrum of Two Dimensional Supersymmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a bound state problem for a family of supersymmetric gauge
theories with fundamental matter. These theories can be obtained by a
dimensional reduction of supersymmetric QCD from three dimensions to 1+1 and
subsequent truncation of some of the fields. We find that the models without
adjoint scalar converge to well-defined continuum limits and calculate the
resulting spectra of these theories. We also find the critical value of
coupling at which an additional massless state is observed. By contrast, the
models containing adjoint scalars, seem to have a continuous mass spectrum in
the limit of infinite volume.
