An M-theory solution generating technique and SL(2,R)
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we generalize the O(p+1,p+1) solution generating technique
(this is a method used to deform Dp-branes by turning on a NS-NS B-field) to
M-theory, in order to be able to deform M5-brane supergravity solutions
directly in eleven dimensions, by turning on a non zero three form A. We find
that deforming the M5-brane, in some cases, corresponds to performing certain
SL(2,R) transformations of the Kahler structure parameter for the three-torus,
on which the M5-brane has been compactified. We show that this new M-theory
solution generating technique can be reduced to the O(p+1,p+1) solution
generating technique with p=4. Further, we find that it implies that the open
membrane metric and generalized noncommutativity parameter are manifestly
deformation independent for electric and light-like deformations. We also
generalize the O(p+1,p+1) method to the type IIA/B NS5-brane in order to be
able to deform NS5-branes with RR three and two forms, respectively. In the
type IIA case we use the newly obtained solution generating technique and
deformation independence to derive a covariant expression for an open D2-brane
coupling, relevant for OD2-theory.
