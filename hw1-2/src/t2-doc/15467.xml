Warped and compact extra dimensions: 5D branes in 6D models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider six dimensional brane world models with a compact and a warped
extra dimension with five dimensional branes. We find that such scenarios have
many interesting features arising from both ADD and Randall-Sundrum -models. In
particular we study a class of models with a single 5D brane and a finite
warped extra dimension, where one of the brane dimensions is compact. In these
models the hierarchy problem can be solved on a single positive tension brane.
