Brane-Antibrane Inflation in Orbifold and Orientifold Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the cosmological implications of brane-antibrane systems in
string-theoretic orbifold and orientifold models. In a class of realistic
models, consistency conditions require branes and antibranes to be stuck at
different fixed points, and so their mutual attraction generates a potential
for one of the radii of the underlying torus or the 4D string dilaton. Assuming
that all other moduli have been fixed by string effects, we find that this
potential leads naturally to a period of cosmic inflation with the radion or
dilaton field as the inflaton. The slow-roll conditions are satisfied more
generically than if the branes were free to move within the space. The
appearance of tachyon fields at certain points in moduli space indicates the
onset of phase transitions to different non-BPS brane systems, providing ways
of ending inflation and reheating the corresponding observable brane universe.
In each case we find relations between the inflationary parameters and the
string scale to get the correct spectrum of density perturbations. In some
examples the small numbers required as inputs are no smaller than 0.01, and are
the same small quantities which are required to explain the gauge hierarchy.
