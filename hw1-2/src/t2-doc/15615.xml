Relativistic wave functions and energies for nonzero angular momentum
  states in light-front dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Light-front dynamics (LFD) is a powerful approach to the theory of
relativistic composite systems (hadrons in the quark models and relativistic
nucleons in nuclei). Its explicitly covariant version has been recently applied
with success to describe the new CEBAF/TJNAF data on the deuteron
electromagnetic form factors. The solutions used in were however not obtained
from solving exactly the LFD equations but by means of a perturbative
calculation with respect to the non relativistic wave function. Since, a
consequent effort has been made to obtain exact solutions of LFD equations. The
first results concerning J=0 states in a scalar model have been published in
nucl-th/9912050. The construction of $J \ne 0$ states in LFD is complicated by
the two following facts. First, the generators of the spatial rotations contain
interaction and are thus difficult to handle. Second, one is always forced to
work in a truncated Fock space, and consequently, the Poincar\'e group
commutation relations between the generators -- ensuring the correct properties
of the state vector under rotation -- are in practice destroyed. In the
standard approach, with the light-front plane defined as $t+z=0$, this
violation of rotational invariance manifests by the fact that the energy
depends on the angular momentum projection on $z$-axis.
  We present here a method to construct $J\ne0$ states in the explicitly
covariant formulation of LFD and show how it leads to a restoration of
rotational invariance.
