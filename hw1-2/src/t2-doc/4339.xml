Higher Loop Effects in M(atrix) Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Scattering of zero branes off the fixed point in $R^8/Z_2$, as described by a
super-quantum mechanics with eight supercharges, displays some novel effects
relevant to Matrix theory in non-compact backgrounds. The leading long distance
behaviour of the moduli space metric receives no correction at one loop in
Matrix theory, but does receive a correction at two loops. There are no
contributions at higher loops. We explicitly calculate the two-loop term,
finding a non-zero result. We find a discrepancy with M(atrix)-theory. Although
the result has the right dependence on $v$ and $b$ for the scattering of zero
branes off the fixed point the factors of $N$ do not match. We also discuss
scattering in the orbifolds, $R^5/Z_2$ and $R^9/Z_2$ where we find the
predicted fractional charges.
