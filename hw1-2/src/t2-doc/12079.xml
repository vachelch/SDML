Massless 3-brane in M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct supersymmetric M3-brane solutions in D=11 supergravity. They can
be viewed as deformations of backgrounds taking the form of a direct product of
four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and a non-compact Ricci-flat manifold of
G_2 holonomy. Although the 4-form field strength is turned on it carries no
charge, and the 3-branes are correspondingly massless. We also obtain 3-branes
of a different type, arising as M5-branes wrapped over S^2.
