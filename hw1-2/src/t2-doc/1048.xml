Higher Derivative Chern--Simons Extensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the higher-derivative extensions of the D=3 Abelian Chern--Simons
topological invariant that would appear in a perturbative effective action's
momentum expansion. The leading, third-derivative, extension I_ECS turns out to
be unique. It remains parity-odd but depends only on the field strength, hence
no longer carries large gauge information, nor is it topological because metric
dependence accompanies the additional covariant derivatives, whose positions
are seen to be fixed by gauge invariance. Viewed as an independent action,
I_ECS requires the field strength to obey the wave equation. The more
interesting model, adjoining I_ECS to the Maxwell action, describes a pair of
excitations. One is massless, the other a massive ghost, as we exhibit both via
the propagator and by performing the Hamiltonian decomposition. We also present
this model's total stress tensor and energy. Other actions involving I_ECS are
also noted.
