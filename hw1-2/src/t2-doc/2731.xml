The Glueball Superpotential
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute glueball superpotentials for four-dimensional, N=1 supersymmetric
gauge theories, with arbitrary gauge groups and massive matter representations.
This is done by perturbatively integrating out massive, charged fields. The
Feynman diagram computations simplify, and are related to the corresponding
matrix model. This leads to a natural notion of ``projection to planar
diagrams'' for arbitrary gauge groups and representations. We discuss a general
ambiguity in the glueball superpotential W(S) for terms, S^n, whose order, n,
is greater than the dual Coxeter number. This ambiguity can be resolved for all
classical gauge groups, (A,B,C,D), via a natural embedding in an infinite rank
supergroup. We use this to resolve some recently raised puzzles. For
exceptional groups, we compute the superpotential terms for low powers of the
glueball field and propose an all-order completion for some examples including
N=1^* for all simply-laced groups. We also comment on compactification of these
theories to lower dimensions.
