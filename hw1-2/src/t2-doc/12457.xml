Quantum Conserved Currents in Supersymmetric Toda Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider $N=1$ supersymmetric Toda theories which admit a fermionic
untwisted affine extension, i.e. the systems based on the $A(n,n)$, $D(n+1,n)$
and $B(n,n)$ superalgebras. We construct the superspace Miura trasformations
which allow to determine the W-supercurrents of the conformal theories and we
compute their renormalized expressions. The analysis of the renormalization and
conservation of higher-spin currents is then performed for the corresponding
supersymmetric massive theories. We establish the quantum integrability of
these models and show that although their Lagrangian is not hermitian, the
masses of the fundamental particles are real, a property which is maintained by
one-loop corrections. The spectrum is actually much richer, since the theories
admit solitons. The existence of quantum conserved higher-spin charges implies
that elastic, factorized S-matrices can be constructed.
