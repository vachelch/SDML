<abstract>
  The quantum evolution equations for the field expectation value are
analytically solved to cubic order in the field amplitude and to one-loop level
in the lambda phi-fourth model. We adapt and use the renormalization group (RG)
method for such non-linear and non-local equations. The time dependence of the
field expectation value is explicitly derived integrating the RG equations. It
is shown that the field amplitude for late times approaches a finite limit as
the time to the power -3/2. This limiting value is expressed as a function of
the initial field amplitude.
