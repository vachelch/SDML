The Massive Kaluza-Klein Monopole
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the (bosonic) effective worldvolume action of an M-theory
Kaluza-Klein monopole in a background given by the bosonic sector of
eleven-dimensional massive supergravity, i.e. a "massive Kaluza-Klein
monopole". As a consistency check we show that the direct dimensional reduction
along the isometry direction of the Taub-NUT space leads to the massive
D-6-brane. We furthermore perform a double dimensional reduction in the
massless case and obtain the effective worldvolume action of a type IIA
Kaluza-Klein monopole.
