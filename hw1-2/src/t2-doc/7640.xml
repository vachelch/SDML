Phase Diagram of Gross-Neveu Model at Finite Temperature, Density and
  Constant Curvature
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a phase structure of chiral symmetry breaking in the Gross-Neveu
model at finite temperature, density and constant curvature. The effective
potential is evaluated in the leading order of the $1/N$-expansion and in a
weak curvature approximation. The third order critical line is found on the
critical surface in the parameter space of temperature, chemical potential and
constant curvature.
