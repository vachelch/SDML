Exact Results in N_c=2 IIB Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate N_c=2 case of IIB matrix model, which is exactly soluble. We
calculate the partition function exactly and obtain a finite result without
introducing any cut-off. We also evaluate some correlation functions consisting
of Wilson loops.
