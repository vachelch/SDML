N=1 Type IIA brane configurations, Chirality and T-duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider four-dimensional N=1 field theories realized by type IIA brane
configurations of NS-branes and D4-branes, in the presence of orientifold
six-planes and D6-branes. These configurations are known to present interesting
effects associated to the appearance of chiral symmetries and chiral matter in
the four-dimensional field theory. We center on models with one compact
direction (elliptic models) and show that, under T-duality, the configurations
are mapped to a set of type IIB D3-branes probing N=1 orientifolds of C^2/Z_N
singularities. We explicitly construct these orientifolds, and show the field
theories on the D3-brane probes indeed reproduces the field theories
constructed using the IIA brane configurations. This T-duality map allows to
understand the type IIB realization of several exotic brane dynamics effects on
the type IIA side: Flavour doubling, the splitting of D6-branes and O6-planes
in crossing a NS-brane and the effect of a non-zero type IIA cosmological
constant turn out to have surprisingly standard type IIB counterparts.
