Fine tuning in the Standard Model and Beyond
</title>

<abstract>
  The fine-tuning principles are examined to predict the top-quark and
Higgs-boson masses. The modification of the Veltman condition based on the
compensation of vacuum energies is developed. It is implemented in the Standard
Model and in its minimal extension with two Higgs doublets and Left-Right
symmetric Model. The top-quark and Higgs-boson couplings are fitted in the SM
for the lowest ultraviolet scale where the fine-tuning can be stable under
rescaling. It yields the low-energy values $m_t \simeq 175 GeV;\quad m_H \simeq
210 GeV$. For the Two-Higgs and Left-Right Symmetric Models the fine-tuning
principles yield the interval for top-quark mass, compatible with the modern
experimental data. For the Left-Right Model the FT principles demand the
existence of the right-handed Majorana neitrinos with masses of order of
right-handed gauge bosons.
