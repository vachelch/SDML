Accelerating Cosmologies from Compactification
</title>

<abstract>
  A solution of the (4+n)-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations is found for
which spacetime is compactified on a compact hyperbolic manifold of
time-varying volume to a flat four-dimensional FLRW cosmology undergoing
accelerated expansion in Einstein conformal frame. This shows that the `no-go'
theorem forbidding acceleration in `standard' (time-independent)
compactifications of string/M-theory does not apply to `cosmological'
(time-dependent) hyperbolic compactifications.
