Mirror Symmetry, Mirror Map and Applications to Complete Intersection
  Calabi-Yau Spaces

<abstract>
  We extend the discussion of mirror symmetry, Picard-Fuchs equations,
instanton-corrected Yukawa couplings, and the topological one-loop partition
function to the case of complete intersections with higher-dimensional moduli
spaces. We will develop a new method of obtaining the instanton-corrected
Yukawa couplings through a close study of the solutions of the Picard-Fuchs
equations. This leads to closed formulas for the prepotential for the K\"ahler
moduli fields induced from the ambient space for all complete intersections in
non singular weighted projective spaces. As examples we treat part of the
moduli space of the phenomenologically interesting three-generation models that
are found in this class. We also apply our method to solve the simplest model
in which a topology change was observed and discuss examples of complete
intersections in singular ambient spaces.
