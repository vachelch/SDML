A Fermionic Hodge Star Operator
</title>

<abstract>
  A fermionic analogue of the Hodge star operation is shown to have an explicit
operator representation in models with fermions, in spacetimes of any
dimension. This operator realizes a conjugation (pairing) not used explicitly
in field-theory, and induces a metric in the space of wave-function(al)s just
as in exterior calculus. If made real (Hermitian), this induced metric turns
out to be identical to the standard one constructed using Hermitian
conjugation; the utility of the induced complex bilinear form remains unclear.
