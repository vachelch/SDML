Singular Monopoles and Gravitational Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We model A_k and D_k asymptotically locally flat gravitational instantons on
the moduli spaces of solutions of U(2) Bogomolny equations with prescribed
singularities. We study these moduli spaces using Ward correspondence and find
their twistor description. This enables us to write down the K\"ahler potential
for A_k and D_k gravitational instantons in a relatively explicit form.
