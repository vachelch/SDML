The geometry of N=4 twisted string
</title>

<abstract>
  We compare N=2 string and N=4 topological string within the framework of the
sigma model approach. Being classically equivalent on a flat background, the
theories are shown to lead to different geometries when put in a curved space.
In contrast to the well studied Kaehler geometry characterising the former
case, in the latter case a manifold has to admit a covariantly constant
holomorphic two-form in order to support an N=4 twisted supersymmetry. This
restricts the holonomy group to be a subgroup of SU(1,1) and leads to a
Ricci--flat manifold. We speculate that, the N=4 topological formalism is an
appropriate framework to smooth down ultraviolet divergences intrinsic to the
N=2 theory.
