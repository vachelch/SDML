Classical moduli $O(\alpha')$ hair
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend existing treatments of black hole solutions in String Gravity to
include moduli fields. We compute the external moduli and dilaton hair, as well
as of their associated axions,to $O(\alpha')$ in the framework of the loop
corrected superstring effective action for a Kerr-Newman black hole background.
