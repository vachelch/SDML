Finite Temperature Schwinger Model with Chirality Breaking Boundary
  Conditions

<abstract>
  The $N_f$-flavour Schwinger Model on a finite space $0\leq x^1\leq L$ and
subject to bag-type boundary-conditions at $x^1=0$ und $x^1=L$ is solved at
finite temperature $T=1/\beta$. The boundary conditions depend on a real
parameter $\theta$ and break the axial flavour symmetry. We argue that this
approach is more appropriate to study the broken phases than introducing
small quark masses, since all calculations can be performed analytically. In
the imaginary time formalism we determine the thermal correlators for the
fermion-fields and the determinant of the Dirac-operator in arbitrary
background gauge-fields. We show that the boundary conditions induce a CP-odd
$\theta$-term in the effective action. The chiral condensate, and in
particular its T- and L- dependence, is calculated for $N_f$ fermions. It is
seen to depend on the order in which the two lengths $\beta=1/T$ and $L$ are
sent to infinity.
