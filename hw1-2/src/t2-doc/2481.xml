From the braided to the usual Yang-Baxter relation
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum monodromy matrices coming from a theory of two coupled (m)KdV
equations are modified in order to satisfy the usual Yang-Baxter relation. As a
consequence, a general connection between braided and {\it unbraided} (usual)
Yang-Baxter algebras is derived and also analysed.
