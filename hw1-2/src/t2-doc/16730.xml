Random Bond Ising Model and Massless Phase of the Gross-Neveu Model
</title>

<abstract>
The $O(n)$ Gross-Neveu model for $n < 2$ presents a massless phase that can be
characterized by right-left mover scattering processes. The limit $n \goto 0$
describes the on-shell properties of the random bond Ising model.
