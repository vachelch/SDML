Laughlin type wave function for two-dimensional anyon fields in a
  KMS-state
</title>

<abstract>
  The correlation functions of two-dimensional anyon fields in a KMS-state are
studied. For T=0 the $n$-particle wave functions of noncanonical fermions of
level $\alpha$, $\alpha$ odd, are shown to be of Laughlin type of order
$\alpha$. For $T>0$ they are given by a simple finite-temperature
generalization of Laughlin's wave function. This relates the first and second
quantized pictures of the fractional quantum Hall effect.
