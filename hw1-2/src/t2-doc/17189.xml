Gauge Fields and M-Fivebrane Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we obtain both the vector and scalar equations of motion of an
M-fivebrane in the presence of threebrane solitons. The resulting equations of
motion are precisely those obtained from the Seiberg-Witten low energy
effective action for N=2 Yang-Mills, including all quantum corrections. This
analysis extends the work of a previous paper which derived the scalar
equations of motion but not in detail the vector equations. We also discuss
some features of an infinite number of higher derivative terms predicted by M
theory.
