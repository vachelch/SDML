Deconfinement at the Argyres-Douglas point in SU(2) gauge theory with
  broken N=2 supersymmetry

<abstract>
  We consider chiral condensates in SU(2) gauge theory with broken N=2
supersymmetry. The matter sector contains an adjoint multiplet and one
fundamental flavor. Matter and gaugino condensates are determined by
integrating out the adjoint field. The only nonperturbative input is the
Affleck-Dine-Seiberg (ADS) superpotential generated by one instanton plus the
Konishi anomaly. These results are consistent with those obtained by the
`integrating in' procedure, including a reproduction of the Seiberg-Witten
curve from the ADS superpotential. We then calculate monopole, dyon, and charge
condensates using the Seiberg-Witten approach. We show that the monopole and
charge condensates vanish at the Argyres-Douglas point where the monopole and
charge vacua collide. We interpret this phenomenon as a deconfinement of
electric and magnetic charges at the Argyres-Douglas point.
