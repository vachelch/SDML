Black Hole Horizon in Superstring Inspired D-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  In $D$-dimensional dilaton gravitational model stationary Schwarzschild type
solutions (centrally symmetrical solutions in vacuum) are obtained. They
contain the two-parameter set of solutions: the first parameter is proportional
to a central mass and the second one describes intensity of the dilaton field.
If the latter parameter equals zero we have pure Schwarzschild solution with
the black hole and constant dilaton field. But when the mentioned parameter is
non-zero and the dilaton is non-constant, the black hole horizon vanishes.
