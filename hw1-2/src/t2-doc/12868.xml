Some Remarks on Gravity in Noncommutative Spacetime and a New Solution
  to the Structure Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, starting from the common foundation of Connes' noncommutative
geometry (NCG) [1,2,3,4], various possible alternatives in the formulation of a
theory of gravity in noncommutative spacetime are discussed in detail. The
diversity in the final physical content of the theory is shown to the the
consequence of the arbitrariness in each construction steps. As an alternative
in the last step, when the staructure equations are to be solved, a minimal set
of constraints on the torsion and connection is found to determine all the
geometric notions in terms of metric. In the Connes-Lott model of
noncommutative spacetime, in order to keep the full spectrum of the discretized
Kaluza-Klein theory [5], it is necessary to include the torsion in the
generalized Einstein-Hilbert-Cartan action.
