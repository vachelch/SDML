Nonlinear Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  After a short discussion of the intimate relation between the generalized
statistics and supersymmetry, we review the recent results on the nonlinear
supersymmetry obtained in the context of the quantum anomaly problem and of the
universal algebraic construction associated with the holomorphic nonlinear
supersymmetry.
