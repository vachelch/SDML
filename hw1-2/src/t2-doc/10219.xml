Two observers calculate the trace anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  We adapt a calculation due to Massacand and Schmid to the coordinate
independent definition of time and vacuum given by Capri and Roy in order to
compute the trace anomaly for a massless scalar field in a curved spacetime in
1+1 dimensions. The computation which requires only a simple regulator and
normal ordering yields the well-known result $\frac{R}{24\pi}$ in a
straightforward manner.
