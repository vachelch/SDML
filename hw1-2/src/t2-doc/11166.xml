Localization of supergravity on the brane
</title>

<abstract>
  A supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum brane-world demands that not merely the
graviton but the entire supergravity multiplet be trapped on the brane. To
demonstrate this, we present a complete ansatz for the reduction of (D=5,N=4)
gauged supergravity to (D=4,N=2) ungauged supergravity in the Randall-Sundrum
geometry. We verify that it is consistent to lowest order in fermion terms. In
particular, we show how the graviphotons avoid the `no photons on the brane'
result because they do not originate from Maxwell's equations in D=5 but rather
from odd-dimensional self-duality equations. In the case of the fivebrane, the
Randall-Sundrum mechanism also provides a new Kaluza-Klein way of obtaining
chiral supergravity starting from non-chiral.
