Phase Space Description of the Leading Order Quark and Gluon Production
  from a Space-Time Dependent Chromofield
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive source terms for the production of quarks and gluons from the QCD
vacuum in the presence of a space-time dependent external chromofield A_{cl} to
the order of S^{(1)}. We found that the source terms for the parton production
processes A_{cl} -> q\bar{q} and A_{cl},A_{cl}A_{cl} -> gg also include the
annihilation processes q\bar{q} -> A_{cl} and gg -> A_{cl},A_{cl}A_{cl}. The
source terms we derive are applicable for the description of the production of
partons with momentum p larger rhan gA which itself must be larger than
\Lambda_{QCD}. We observe that these source terms for the production of partons
from a space-time dependent chromofield can be used to study the production and
equilibration of the quark-gluon plasma during the very early stages of an
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collision.
