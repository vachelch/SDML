Uniting Gross-Neveu and Massive Schwinger Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that it is possible to obtain the Gross-Neveu model in 1+1 dimensions
from gauge fields only. This is reminiscent of the fact that in 1+1 dimensions
the gauge field tensor is essentially a pseudo-scalar. We also show that it is
possible in this context to combine the Gross-Neveu model with the massive
Schwinger model in the limit where the fermion mass is larger than the electric
charge.
