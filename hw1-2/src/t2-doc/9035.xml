Charged Rotating Black Branes in anti-de Sitter Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new class of charged rotating solutions in the
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a negative cosmological constant. These
solutions may be interpreted as black brane solutions with two inner and outer
event horizons or an extreme black brane depending on the value of the mass
parameter $m$. We also find that the Killing vectors are the null generators of
the event horizon. The physical properties of the brane such as the
temperature, the angular velocity, the entropy, the electric charge and
potential are computed. We also compute the action and the Gibbs potential as a
function of temperature and angular velocity for the uncharged solutions, and
compute the angular momentum and the mass of the black brane through the use of
Gibbs potential. We show that these thermodynamic quantities satisfy the first
law of thermodynamics. We also perform a local stability analysis of the
asymptotically AdS uncharged rotating black brane in various dimensions and
show that they are locally stable for the whole phase space both in the
canonical and grand-canonical ensemble. We found that the thermodynamic
properties of Gauss-Bonnet rotating black branes are completely the same as
those without the Gauss-Bonnet term, although the two solutions are quite
different.
