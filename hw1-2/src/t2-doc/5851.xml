New Vacua for Type II String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Lorentz-invariant expectation values for antisymmetric tensor field strengths
in Calabi-Yau compactification of IIA string theory are considered. These are
found to impart magnetic and/or electric charges to the dilaton hypermultiplet.
This results in a potential which can have supersymmetric minima at zero
coupling or at conifold points in the moduli space. The latter occurs whenever
the dilaton charge is aligned with that of the light black hole at the
conifold. It is shown that there is a flat direction extending from the
conifold along which there is a black hole condensate whose strength is of
order the string coupling $g_s$. It is speculated that these new vacua
correspond to string compactification on generalized Calabi-Yau spaces which
have $c_1=0$ but are not Kahler.
