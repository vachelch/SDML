Les Houches lectures on supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce simple and more advanced concepts that have played a key role in
the development of supersymmetric systems. This is done by first describing
various supersymmetric quantum mechanics models. Topics covered include the
basic construction of supersymmetric field theories, the phase structure of
supersymmetric systems with and without gauge particles, superconformal
theories and infrared duality in both field theory and string theory. A
discussion of the relation of conformal symmetry to a vanishing vacuum energy
(cosmological constant) is included.
