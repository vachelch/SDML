The Dynamics of Classical Chiral $QCD_{2}$ Currents
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper the dynamics of the classical chiral $QCD_{2}$ currents is
studied. We describe how the dynamics of the theory can be summarized in an
equation of the Lax form, thereby demonstrating the existence of an infinite
set of conserved quantities. Next, the $r$ matrix of a fundamental Poisson
relation is obtained and used to demonstrate that the conserved charges Poisson
commute. An underlying diffeomorphism symmetry of the equations of motion which
is not a symmetry of the action is used to provide a geometric interpretation
for the case of gauge group SU(2). This enables us to show that the solutions
to the classical equations of motion can be identified with a large class of
curves, to demonstrate an auto-B\"acklund transformation and to demonstrate a
non linear superposition principle. A link between the spectral problem for
$QCD_{2}$ and the solution to the closed curve problem is also demonstrated. We
then go on to provide a systematic inverse scattering treatment. This formalism
is used to obtain the reflectionless single boundstate eigenvalue soliton
solution.
