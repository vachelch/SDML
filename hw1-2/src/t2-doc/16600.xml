Asymptotic Conformal Yano--Killing Tensors for Schwarzschild Metric
</title>

<abstract>
  The asymptotic conformal Yano--Killing tensor proposed in J. Jezierski, On
the relation between metric and spin-2 formulation of linearized Einstein
theory [GRG, in print (1994)] is analyzed for Schwarzschild metric and tensor
equations defining this object are given. The result shows that the
Schwarzschild metric (and other metrics which are asymptotically
``Schwarzschildean'' up to O(1/r^2) at spatial infinity) is among the metrics
fullfilling stronger asymptotic conditions and supertranslations ambiguities
disappear. It is also clear from the result that 14 asymptotic gravitational
charges are well defined on the ``Schwarzschildean'' background.
