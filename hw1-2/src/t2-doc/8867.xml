Finite Size Effects for the Ising Model Coupled to 2-D Random Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Finite size effects for the Ising Model coupled to two dimensional random
surfaces are studied by exploiting the exact results from the 2-matrix models.
The fixed area partition function is numerically calculated with arbitrary
precision by developing an efficient algorithm for recursively solving the
quintic equations so encountered. An analytic method for studying finite size
effects is developed based on the behaviour of the free energy near its
singular points. The generic form of finite size corrections so obtained are
seen to be quite different from the phenomenological parameterisations used in
the literature. The method of singularities is also applied to study the
magnetic susceptibility. A brief discussion is presented on the implications of
these results to the problem of a reliable determination of string
susceptibility from numerical simulations.
