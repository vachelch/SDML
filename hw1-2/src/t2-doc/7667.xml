Spacetime models, fundamental interactions and noncommutative geometry

<abstract>
  We discuss the problem of determining the spacetime structure. We show that
when we are using only topological methods the spacetime can be modelled as an
R- or Q-compact space although the R-compact spaces seem to be more
appropriate. Demanding the existence of a differential structure substantially
narrows the choice of possible models. The determination of the differential
structure may be difficult if it is not unique. By using the noncommutative
geometry construction of the standard model we show that fundamental
interactions determine the spacetime in the class of R-compact spaces. Fermions
are essential for the process of determining the spacetime structure.
