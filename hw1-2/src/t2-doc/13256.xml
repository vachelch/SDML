Renormalization group approach to interacting polymerised manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose to study the infrared behaviour of polymerised (or tethered)
random manifolds of dimension D interacting via an exclusion condition with a
fixed impurity in d-dimensional Euclidean space in which the manifold is
embedded. We prove rigorously, via methods of Wilson's renormalization group,
the convergence to a non Gaussian fixed point for suitably chosen physical
parameters.
