Dual D-Brane Actions on $AdS^5 \times S^5$
</title>

<abstract>
  Utilizing coset superspace approach, dual actions of super D1-and D3-branes
on $AdS_5 \times S^5$ are constructed by carrying out duality transformation of
world-volume U(1) gauge field. Resulting world-volume actions are shown to
possess expected SL(2,{\bf Z}) properties. Crucial ingredient for deriving
SL(2, {\bf Z}) transformation property of the D-brane actions is covariance of
SU(2,2|4) coset superspace algebra under SO(2) rotation between two
ten-dimensional Type IIB Majorana-Weyl spinors.
