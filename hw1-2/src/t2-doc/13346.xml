Nonabelian Gauge Symmetry in the Causal Epstein-Glaser Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We present some generalizations of a recently proposed alternative approach
to nonabelian gauge theories based on the causal Epstein-Glaser method in
perturbative quantum field theory. Nonabelian gauge invariance is defined by a
simple commutator relation in every order of perturbation theory separately
using only the linear (abelian) BRS-transformations of the asymptotic fields.
This condition is sufficient for the unitarity of the S-matrix in the physical
subspace. We derive the most general specific coupling compatible with the
conditions of nonabelian gauge invariance and normalizability. We explicitly
show that the quadrilinear terms, the four-gluon-coupling and the
four-ghost-coupling, are generated by our linear condition of nonabelian gauge
invariance. Moreover, we work out the required generalizations for linear
gauges.
