Derivative expansion and renormalisation group flows
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the convergence of the derivative expansion for flow equations. The
convergence strongly depends on the choice for the infrared regularisation.
Based on the structure of the flow, we explain why optimised regulators lead to
better physical predictions. This is applied to O(N)-symmetric real scalar
field theories in 3d, where critical exponents are computed for all N. In
comparison to the sharp cut-off regulator, an optimised flow improves the
leading order result up to 10%. An analogous reasoning is employed for a proper
time renormalisation group. We compare our results with those obtained by other
methods.
