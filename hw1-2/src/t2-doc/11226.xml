Structure constants for the osp(1|2) current algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the free field realization of the two-dimensional osp(1|2) current
algebra. We consider the case in which the level of the affine osp(1|2)
symmetry is a positive integer. Using the Coulomb gas technique we obtain
integral representations for the conformal blocks of the model. In particular,
from the behaviour of the four-point function, we extract the structure
constants for the product of two arbitrary primary operators of the theory.
From this result we derive the fusion rules of the osp(1|2) conformal field
theory and we explore the connections between the osp(1|2) affine symmetry and
the N=1 superconformal field theories.
