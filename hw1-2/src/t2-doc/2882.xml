O(N) models within the local potential approximation
</title>

<abstract>
  Using Wegner-Houghton equation, within the Local Potential Approximation, we
study critical properties of O(N) vector models. Fixed Points, together with
their critical exponents and eigenoperators, are obtained for a large set of
values of N, including N=0 and N\to\infty. Polchinski equation is also treated.
The peculiarities of the large N limit, where a line of Fixed Points at d=2+2/n
is present, are studied in detail. A derivation of the equation is presented
together with its projection to zero modes.
