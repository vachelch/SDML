Microscopic Spectrum of the QCD Dirac Operator in Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The microscopic spectral correlators of the Dirac operator in
three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory coupled to fundamental fermions and with
three or more colours are derived from the supersymmetric formulation of
partially quenched effective Lagrangians. The flavour supersymmetry breaking
patterns are appropriately identified and used to calculate the corresponding
finite volume partition functions from Itzykson-Zuber type integrals over
supersymmetric cosets. New and simple determinant expressions for the spectral
correlators in the mesoscopic scaling region are thereby found. The microscopic
spectrum derived from the effective finite volume partition function of
three-dimensional QCD agrees with earlier results based on the unitary ensemble
of random matrix theory and extends the corresponding calculations for QCD in
four dimensions.
