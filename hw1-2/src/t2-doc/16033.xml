$R$-matrices for Elliptic Calogero-Moser Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical $R$-matrix structure for the $n$-particle Calogero-Moser models
with (type IV) elliptic potentials is investigated. We show there is no
momentum independent $R$-matrix (without spectral parameter) when $n\ge4$. The
assumption of momentum independence is sufficient to reproduce the dynamical
$R$-matrices of Avan and Talon for the type I,II,III degenerations of the
elliptic potential. The inclusion of a spectral parameter enables us to find
$R$-matrices for the general elliptic potential.
