On Discrete Symmetries of the Multi-Boson KP Hierarchies
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the multi-boson KP hierarchies possess a class of discrete
symmetries linking them to the discrete Toda systems. These discrete symmetries
are generated by the similarity transformation of the corresponding Lax
operator. This establishes a canonical nature of the discrete transformations.
The spectral equation, which defines both the lattice system and the
corresponding Lax operator, plays a key role in determining pertinent symmetry
structure. We also introduce a concept of the square-root lattice leading to a
family of new pseudo-differential operators with covariance under additional
B\"{a}cklund transformations.
