Nambu Quantum Mechanics: A Nonlinear Generalization of Geometric Quantum
  Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a generalization of the standard geometric formulation of quantum
mechanics, based on the classical Nambu dynamics of free Euler tops. This
extended quantum mechanics has in lieu of the standard exponential time
evolution, a nonlinear temporal evolution given by Jacobi elliptic functions.
In the limit where latter's moduli parameters are set to zero, the usual
geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, based on the Kahler structure of a
complex projective Hilbert space, is recovered. We point out various novel
features of this extended quantum mechanics, including its geometric aspects.
Our approach sheds a new light on the problem of quantization of Nambu
dynamics. Finally, we argue that the structure of this nonlinear quantum
mechanics is natural from the point of view of string theory.
