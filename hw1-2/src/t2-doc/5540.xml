The Born-Infeld electromagnetism in Kaluza-Klein theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the properties of non-linear electromagnetism based on the
Born-Infeld Lagrangian in multi-dimensional theories of Kaluza-Klein type. We
consider flat space-time solutions only, which means that the space-time metric
is constant, and the only supplementary variable is the dilaton field, a
scalar. We show that in the case of Kaluza-Klein theory, the Born-Infeld
Lagrangian describes an interesting interaction between the electromagnetic and
scalar fields, whose propagation properties are modified in a non-trivial
manner.
