BFV-Type Representation of Path-Integral for Dynamical System with
  second class constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the phase space of a dynamical system subject to second
class constraints can be extended by ghost variables in such a way that some
formal analogies of the $\Omega$-charge and the unitarizing Hamiltonian can be
constructed. Then BFV-type path integral representation for the generating
functional of Green's functions is written and shown to coincide with the
standard one.
