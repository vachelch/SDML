Meander Determinants
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove a determinantal formula for quantities related to the problem of
enumeration of (semi-) meanders, namely the topologically inequivalent planar
configurations of non-self-intersecting loops crossing a given (half-) line
through a given number of points. This is done by the explicit Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization of certain bases of subspaces of the Temperley-Lieb algebra.
