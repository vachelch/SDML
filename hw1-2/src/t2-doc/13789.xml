Neumann Boundary Conditions from Born-Infeld Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that certain excitations of the F-string/D3-brane system can be shown
to obey Neumann boundary conditions by considering Born-Infeld dynamics of the
F-string (viewed as a 3-brane cylindrically wrapped on an $S_2$). Excitations
which are coming down the string with a polarization along a direction parallel
to the brane are almost completely reflected just as in the case of all-normal
excitations, but the end of the string moves freely on the 3-brane, thus
realizing Polchinski's open string Neumann boundary condition dynamically. In
the low energy limit w -> 0, i.e. for wavelengths much larger than the string
scale only a small fraction ~w^4 of the energy escapes in the form of dipole
radiation. The physical interpretation is that a string attached to the 3-brane
manifests itself as an electric charge, and waves on the string cause the end
point of the string to freely oscillate and therefore produce electromagnetic
dipole radiation in the asymptotic outer region.
