Properties of the massive Thirring model from the XYZ spin chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider here the massive Thirring model regularized with the XYZ spin
chain. We numerically calculate the mass ratios of particles which lie in the
discrete part of the spectrum and obtain results in accordance with the DHN
formula and in disagreement with recent calculations in the literature based on
the numerical Bethe ansatz and infinite momentum frame methods. We also analyze
the short distance behavior of these states and evaluate the conformal
dimensions. This paper, taken together with the previous one for the
sine-Gordon model, confirms the duality relation between two models formulated
by Klassen and Melzer [Int. J. Mod. Phys. A 8, 4131 (1993)].
