Quantum Dynamics of the Slow Rollover Transition in the Linear Delta
  Expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the linear delta expansion to the quantum mechanical version of the
slow rollover transition which is an important feature of inflationary models
of the early universe. The method, which goes beyond the Gaussian
approximation, gives results which stay close to the exact solution for longer
than previous methods. It provides a promising basis for extension to a full
field theoretic treatment.
