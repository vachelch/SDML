  For the noncommutative torus ${\cal T}$, in case of the N.C. parameter$\theta
= \frac{Z}{n}$ and the area of ${\cal T}$ is an integer, we construct the basis
of Hilbert space ${\cal H}_n$ in terms of $\theta$functions of the positions
$z_i$ of $n$ solitons. The loop wrapping a$the torus generates the algebra
${\cal A}_n$. We show that ${\cal A}_$isomorphic to the $Z_n \times Z_n$

and $g$. Th$is easy to give the projection operators corresponding to the
