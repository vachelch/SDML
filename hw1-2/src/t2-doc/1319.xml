Regularization and the BV Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We summarize the application of the field--antifield formalism to the
quantization of gauge field theories. After the gauge fixing, the main issues
are the regularization and anomalies. We illustrate this for chiral $W_3$
gravity. We discuss also gauge theories with a non-local action, induced by a
matter system with an anomaly. As an illustration we use induced WZW models,
including a discussion of non--local regularization, the importance of the
measure and regularization of multiple loops. In these theories antifields
become propagating --- one of many roles assigned to them in the BV formalism.
