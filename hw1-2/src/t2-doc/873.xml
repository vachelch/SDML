The Noncommutative Bion Core
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine noncommutative solutions of the nonabelian theory on the
world-volume of N coincident D-strings. These solutions can be interpreted in
terms of noncommutative geometry as funnels describing the nonabelian D-string
expanding out into an orthogonal D3-brane. These configurations are `dual' to
the bion solutions in the abelian world-volume theory of the D3-brane. In the
latter, a charge N magnetic monopole describes N D-strings attached to the
D3-brane with a spike deformation of the world-volume. The noncommutative
D-string solutions give a reliable account of physics at the core of the
monopole, where the bion description is expected to breakdown. In the large N
limit, we find good agreement between the two points of view, including the
energy, couplings to background fields, and the shape of the funnel. We also
study fluctuations traveling along the D-string, again obtaining agreement in
the large N limit. At finite N, our results give a limit on the number of modes
that can travel to infinity along the N D-strings attached to the D3-brane.
