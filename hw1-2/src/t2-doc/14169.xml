Dynamical Superfield Theory of Free Massive Superspin-1 Multiplet
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an N=1 supersymmetric Lagrangian model for the massive
superspin-1 superfield. The model is described by a dynamical spinor superfield
and an auxiliary chiral scalar superfield. On-shell this model leads to a
spin-1/2, spin-3/2 and two spin-1 propagating component fields. The superfield
action is given and its structure in the fermionic component sector is
presented. We prove that the most general theory is characterized by a one
parameter family of actions. The massless limit is shown to correspond to the
dynamics of both the gravitino and superhelicity-1/2 multiplets.
