Integrable Many-Body Systems of Calogero-Moser-Sutherland Type in High
  Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  A new series of integrable cases of the many-body problem in many-dimensional
spaces is found. That series appears as a part of the larger series of
integrable problems, which are in 1-1 correspondence with Krichever-Novikov
algebras of affine type (that is with pairs each one consisting of some finite
root system and some Riemann surface of finite genus with two marked points).
