Nonsingular multidimensional cosmologies without fine tuning
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact cosmological solutions for effective actions in D dimensions inspired
by the tree-level superstring action are studied. For a certain range of free
parameters existing in the model, nonsingular bouncing solutions are found.
Among them, of particular interest can be open hyperbolic models, in which,
without any fine tuning, the internal scale factor and the dilaton field
(connected with string coupling in string theories) tend to constant values at
late times. A cosmological singularity is avoided due to nonminimal
dilaton-gravity coupling and, for D > 11, due to pure imaginary nature of the
dilaton, which conforms to currently discussed unification models. The
existence of such and similar solutions supports the opinion that the Universe
had never undergone a stage driven by full-scale quantum gravity.
