Towards a manifestly SL(2,Z)-covariant action for the type IIB (p,q)
  super-five-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We determine a manifestly SL(2,Z)-covariant kappa-symmetric action for the
type IIB (p,q) five-branes as a perturbative expansion in the world-volume
field strengths within the framework where the brane tension is generated by a
world-volume field. In this formulation the Lagrangian is expected to be
polynomial; we construct the kappa-invariant action to fourth order in the
world-volume field strengths.
