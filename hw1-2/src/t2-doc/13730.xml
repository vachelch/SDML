Strong Coupling Effects in non-commutative spaces from OM Theory and
  supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a four-parameter class of 3+1 dimensional NCOS theories can be
obtained by dimensional reduction on a general 2-torus from OM theory.
Compactifying two spatial directions of NCOS theory on a 2-torus, we study the
transformation properties under the $SO(2,2;Z)$ T-duality group. We then
discuss non-perturbative configurations of non-commutative super Yang-Mills
theory. In particular, we calculate the tension for magnetic monopoles and
(p,q) dyons and exhibit their six-dimensional origin, and construct a
supergravity solution representing an instanton in the gauge theory. We also
compute the potential for a monopole-antimonopole in the supergravity
approximation.
