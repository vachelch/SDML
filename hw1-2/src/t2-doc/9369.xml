Non-holomorphic Corrections from Threebranes in F Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct solutions of type IIB supergravity dual to N=2 super Yang-Mills
theories. By considering a probe moving in a background with constant coupling
and an AdS_{5} component in its geometry, we are able to reproduce the exact
low energy effective action for the theory with gauge group SU(2) and N_{f}=4
massless flavors. After turning on a mass for the flavors we find corrections
to the AdS_{5} geometry. In addition, the coupling shows a power law dependence
on the energy scale of the theory. The origin of the power law behaviour of the
coupling is traced back to instanton corrections. Instanton corrections to the
four derivative terms in the low energy effective action are correctly obtained
from a probe analysis. By considering a Wilson loop in this geometry we are
also able to compute the instanton effects on the quark-antiquark potential.
Finally we consider a solution corresponding to an asymptotically free field
theory. Again, the leading form of the four derivative terms in the low energy
effective action are in complete agreement with field theory expectations.
