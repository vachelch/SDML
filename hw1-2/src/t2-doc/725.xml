The 3-Form Multiplet in Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the couplings of the 3-form supermultiplet to the general
supergravity-matter-Yang-Mills system. Based on the methods of superspace
geometry, we identify component fields, establish their supergravity
transformations and construct invariant component field actions. Two specific
applications are adressed: the appearance of fundamental 3-forms in the context
of strong-weak duality and the use of the 3-form supermultiplets to describe
effective degrees of freedom relevant to the mechanism of gaugino condensation.
