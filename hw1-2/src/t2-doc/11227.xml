Universality and Scaling at the Onset of Quantum Black Hole Formation
</title>

<abstract>
  In certain two-dimensional models, collapsing matter forms a black hole if
and only if the incoming energy flux exceeds the Hawking radiation rate. Near
the critical threshold, the black hole mass is given by a universal formula in
terms of the distance from criticality, and there exists a scaling solution
describing the formation and evaporation of an arbitrarily small black hole.
