Critical Behavior of Simplicial Chiral Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The large-N saddle-point equations for the principal chiral models defined on
a d-1 dimensional simplex are derived from the external field problem for
unitary integrals. The saddle point equation are studied analytically and
numerically in many relevant instances, including d=4 and $d\rightarrow\infty$,
with special attention to the critical domain, which is found to correspond to
$\beta_c=1/d$ for all d. Related models (chiral chains) are discussed and
large-N solutions are analyzed.
