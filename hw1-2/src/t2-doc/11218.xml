On possible generalization of the superstring action to eleven
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a D=11 super Poincar\'e invariant action for the superstring which
has free dynamics in the physical variables sector. Instead of the standard
approach based on the searching for an action with local $\kappa$-symmetry (or,
equivalently, with corresponding first class constraints), we propose a theory
with fermionic constraints of second class only. Then the $\kappa$-symmetry and
the well known $\Gamma$-matrix identities are not necessary for the
construction. Thus, at the classical level, the superstring action of the type
described can exist in any spacetime dimensions and the known brane-scan can be
revisited.
