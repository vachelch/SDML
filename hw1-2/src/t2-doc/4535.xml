The anomalous dimension of the composite operator A^2 in the Landau
  gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  The local composite operator A^2 is analysed in pure Yang-Mills theory in the
Landau gauge within the algebraic renormalization. It is proven that the
anomalous dimension of A^2 is not an independent parameter, being expressed as
a linear combination of the gauge beta function and of the anomalous dimension
of the gauge fields.
