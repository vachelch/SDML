Magnetic Strings In Five Dimensional Gauged Supergravity Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Magnetic BPS string solutions preserving quarter of supersymmetry are
obtained for all abelian gauged d=5 N=2 supergravity theories coupled to vector
supermultiplets. Due to a ``generalised Dirac quantization'' condition
satisfied by the minimized magnetic central charge, the string metric takes a
universal form for all five dimensional gauged theories.
