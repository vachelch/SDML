On the Monodromies of N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory with Gauge
  Group SO(2n)
</title>

<abstract>
  We present families of algebraic curves describing the moduli-space of
$N\!=\!2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $SO(2n)$. We test
our curves by computing the weak coupling monodromies and the number of
$N\!=\!1$ vacua.
