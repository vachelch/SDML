The Asymptotic Method Developed from Weak Turbulent Theory and the
  Nonlinear Permeability and Damping Rate in QGP
</title>

<abstract>
  With asymptotic method developed from weak turbulent theory, the kinetic
equations for QGP are expanded in fluctuation field potential $A^T_\mu $.
Considering the second-order and third-order currents, we derive the nonlinear
permeability tensor function from Yang-Mills field equation, and find that the
third-order current is more important in turbulent theory. The nonlinear
permeability formulae for longitudinal color oscillations show that the
non-Abelian effects are more important than the Abelian-like effects. To
compare with other works, we give the numerical result of the damping rate for
the modes with zero wave vector.
