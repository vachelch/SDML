  equations in D dimensions

<abstract>
  We classify the spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell
Dilaton field equations in D dimensions and find some exact solutions of the
string theory at all orders of the string tension parameter. We also show the
uniqueness of the black hole solutions of this theory in static axially
symmetric spacetimes.
