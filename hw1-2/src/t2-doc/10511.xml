Thermal Renormalons in Scalar Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the frame of the scalar theory $g \phi ^{4}$, we explore the occurrence of
thermal renormalons, i. e. temperature dependent singularities in the Borel
plane. The discussion of a particular renormalon type diagram at finite
temperature, using Thermofield Dynamics, allows us to establish that these
singularities actually get a temperature dependence. This dependence appears in
the residues of the poles, remaining their positions unchanged with
temperature.
