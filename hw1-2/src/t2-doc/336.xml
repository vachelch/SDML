BMN operators and string field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We extract from gauge theoretical calculations the matrix elements of the SYM
dilatation operator. By the BMN correspondence this should coincide with the
3-string vertex of light cone string field theory in the pp-wave background. We
find a mild but important discrepancy with the SFT results. If the modified
$O(g_2)$ matrix elements are used, the $O(g_2^2)$ anomalous dimensions are
exactly reproduced without the need for a contact interaction in the single
string sector.
