Cosmological Perturbations in Brane-World Theories: Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a gauge-invariant formalism to describe metric perturbations in
five-dimensional brane-world theories. In particular, this formalism applies to
models originating from heterotic M-theory. We introduce a generalized
longitudinal gauge for scalar perturbations. As an application, we discuss some
aspects of the evolution of fluctuations on the brane. Moreover, we show how
the five-dimensional formalism can be matched to the known four-dimensional one
in the limit where an effective four-dimensional description is appropriate.
