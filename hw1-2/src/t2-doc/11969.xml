The $n$-component KP hierarchy and representation theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from free charged fermions we give equivalent definitions of the
$n\/$-component KP hierarchy, in terms of $\tau\/$-functions $\tau_\alpha\/$
(where $\alpha \in M =\/$ root lattice of $sl_n\/$), in terms of $n \times n\/$
matrix valued wave functions $W_\alpha(\alpha\in M)\/$, and in terms of
pseudodifferential wave operators $P_\alpha(\alpha\in M)\/$. These imply the
deformation and the zero curvature equations. We show that the 2-component KP
hierarchy contains the Davey-Stewartson system and the $n\geq3\/$ component KP
hierarchy continues the $n\/$-wave interaction equations. This allows us to
construct theis solutions.
