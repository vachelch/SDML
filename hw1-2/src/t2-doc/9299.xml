Modular Symmetries of Threshold Corrections for Abelian Orbifolds with
  Discrete Wilson Lines
</title>

<abstract>
  The modular symmetries of string loop threshold corrections for gauge
coupling constants are studied in the presence of discrete Wilson lines for all
examples of abelian orbifolds, where the point group is realised by the action
of Coxeter elements or generalised Coxeter elements on the root lattices of the
Lie groups.
