Gauge invariant formulation of $N=2$ Toda and KdV systems in extended
  superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a gauge invariant formulation of $N=2$ supersymmetric abelian Toda
field equations in \n2 superspace. Superconformal invariance is studied. The
conserved currents are shown to be associated with Drinfeld-Sokolov type
gauges. The extension to non-abelian \n2 Toda equations is discussed. Very
similar methods are then applied to a matrix formulation in \n2 superspace of
one of the \n2 KdV hierarchies.
