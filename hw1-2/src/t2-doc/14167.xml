Boundary effects in two-dimensional critical and off-critical systems
</title>

<abstract>
  Critical systems are described by conformal field theories, whose dynamics
can be exactly solved in two dimensions. In the presence of a boundary, with
the so-called method of images it is possible to study the surface critical
behaviour of these systems, and the conformal boundary conditions can be
related to the bulk operator content of the theory. After an overview of the
basic concepts of bulk and boundary conformal field theory, we present an
explicit calculation of some two-point correlation functions in Virasoro
minimal models with boundary. In the second part of the thesis, we summarize
the known results about perturbed conformal field theories, which describe the
dynamics of systems away from the critical point. We concentrate on cases in
which the off-critical massive field theory is integrable, with a corresponding
purely elastic and factorized scattering theory, focusing our attention on the
bootstrap approach. We also present the basic properties of affine Toda field
theories, whose S-matrices are closely related to the ones of some perturbed
minimal models. In the presence of a boundary, assuming that the boundary
conditions are compatible with integrability, the scattering theory is still
elastic and factorized. The analytic structure of the reflection matrix encodes
the boundary spectrum of the theory, in the light of a bootstrap approach
analogous to the bulk one. Starting from two kinds of known reflection
amplitudes, we have performed a detailed study of the boundary bound states
structure for the three E_{n} affine Toda field theories and for the
corresponding perturbed minimal models.
