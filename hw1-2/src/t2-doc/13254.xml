Generating new supergravity solutions using Ehlers-Harrison-type
  transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  The technique of generating new solutions to 4D gravity/matter systems by
dimensional reduction to a sigma-model is extended to supersymmetric
configurations of supergravity. The conditions required for the preservation of
supersymmetry under isometry transformations in the sigma-model target space
are found. Some examples illustrating the technique are given.
