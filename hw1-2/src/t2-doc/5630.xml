Branes with Background Fields in Boundary State Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  Interaction of branes in presence of internal gauge fields is considered by
using the boundary state formalism. This approach enables us to consider the
problems that are not easily accessible to the canonical approach via open
strings. The effects of compactification of some of the dimensions on tori are
also discussed. Also we study the massless state contribution on this
interaction.
