Photons and Gravitons as Goldstone Bosons, and the Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We reexamine a scenario in which photons and gravitons arise as Goldstone
bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance. We study
the emergence of Lorentz invariant low energy physics in an effective field
theory framework, with non-Lorentz invariant effects arising from radiative
corrections and higher order interactions. Spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz
group also leads to additional exotic but weakly coupled Goldstone bosons,
whose dispersion relations we compute. The usual cosmological constant problem
is absent in this context: being a Goldstone boson, the graviton can never
develop a potential, and the existence of a flat spacetime solution to the
field equations is guaranteed.
