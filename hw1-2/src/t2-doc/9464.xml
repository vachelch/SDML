Probes in fluxbranes and supersymmetry breaking through Hodge-duality
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we consider what happens to an M2-brane probe when Minkowski
space is dimensionally reduced to a fluxbrane solution of IIA supergravity.
Given that fluxbrane reductions generally break supersymmetry, we look at how
supersymmetry is realised on the D2-brane probe after dualisation. We also show
how to extend this to more general non-linear sigma models.
