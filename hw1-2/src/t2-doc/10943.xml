A Quasiperiodic Gibbons--Hawking Metric and Spacetime Foam
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a quasiperiodic self-dual metric of the Gibbons--Hawking type with
one gravitational instanton per spacetime cell. The solution, based on an
adaptation of Weierstrassian $\zeta$ and $\sigma$ functions to three
dimensions, conforms to a definition of spacetime foam given by Hawking.
