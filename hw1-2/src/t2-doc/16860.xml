Quasi-local structure of p-form theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Hamiltonian dynamics of the self-interacting, abelian p-form
theory in D=2p+2 dimensional space-time gives rise to the quasi-local
structure. Roughly speaking, it means that the field energy is localized but on
closed 2p-dimensional surfaces (quasi-localized). From the mathematical point
of view this approach is implied by the boundary value problem for the
corresponding field equations. Various boundary problems, e.g. Dirichlet or
Neumann, lead to different Hamiltonian dynamics. Physics seems to prefer
gauge-invariant, positively defined Hamiltonians which turn out to be
quasi-local. Our approach is closely related with the standard two-potential
formulation and enables one to generate e.g. duality transformations in a
perfectly local way (but with respect to a new set of nonlocal variables).
Moreover, the form of the quantization condition displays very similar
structure to that of the symplectic form of the underlying p-form theory
expressed in the quasi-local language.
