The spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain, the quantum algebra U_q[sl(2)], and
  duality transformations for minimal models

<abstract>
  The finite-size scaling spectra of the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain with
toroidal boundary conditions and an even number of sites provide a projection
mechanism yielding the spectra of models with a central charge c<1 including
the unitary and non-unitary minimal series. Taking into account the
half-integer angular momentum sectors - which correspond to chains with an odd
number of sites - in many cases leads to new spinor operators appearing in the
projected systems. These new sectors in the XXZ chain correspond to a new type
of frustration lines in the projected minimal models. The corresponding new
boundary conditions in the Hamiltonian limit are investigated for the Ising
model and the 3-state Potts model and are shown to be related to duality
transformations which are an additional symmetry at their self-dual critical
point. By different ways of projecting systems we find models with the same
central charge sharing the same operator content and modular invariant
partition function which however differ in the distribution of operators into
sectors and hence in the physical meaning of the operators involved. Related to
the projection mechanism in the continuum there are remarkable symmetry
properties of the finite XXZ chain. The observed degeneracies in the energy and
momentum spectra are shown to be the consequence of intertwining relations
involving U_q[sl(2)] quantum algebra transformations.
