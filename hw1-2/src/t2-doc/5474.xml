Localized Branes and Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We address the delocalization of low dimensional D-branes and NS-branes when
they are a part of a higher dimensional BPS black brane, and the homogeneity of
the resulting horizon. We show that the effective delocalization of such branes
is a classical effect that occurs when localized branes are brought together.
Thus, the fact that the few known solutions with inhomogeneous horizons are
highly singular need not indicate a singularity of generic D- and NS-brane
states. Rather, these singular solutions are likely to be unphysical as they
cannot be constructed from localized branes which are brought together from a
finite separation.
