Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, Non-minimal Coupling, and Cosmological
  Constant Problem
</title>

<abstract>
  Treating the gravitational field as a dynamical field, we study the
spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by a scalar field under its
self-interaction and non-minimal interaction with gravity in four dimensional
space-time. In particular, we explore the feasibility of inducing spontaneous
symmetry breaking after introducing the non-minimal coupling, and discuss
briefly the cosmological constant problem corresponding to the phase transition
associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking.
