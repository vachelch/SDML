  We derive (quasi-)quantum groups in 2+1 dimensional topological field theory
directly from the classical action and the path integral. Detailed
computations are carried out for the Chern-Simons theory with finite gauge
group. The principles behind our computations are presumably more general. We
extend the classical action in a d+1 dimensional topological theory to
manifolds of dimension less than d+1. We then ``construct'' a generalized path
integral which in d+1 dimensions reduces to the standard one and in d
dimensions reproduces the quantum Hilbert space. In a 2+1 dimensional
topological theory the path integral over the circle is the category of
representations of a quasi-quantum group. In this paper we only consider
finite theories, in which the generalized path integral reduces to a finite
sum. New ideas are needed to extend beyond the finite theories treated here.
