New symmetries for Abelian gauge theory in superfield formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  We show the existence of some new local, covariant and continuous symmetries
for the BRST invariant Lagrangian density of a free two ($1 + 1$)-dimensional
(2D) Abelian U(1) gauge theory in the framework of superfield formalism. The
Noether conserved charges corresponding to the above local continuous
symmetries find their geometrical origin as the translation generators along
the odd (Grassmannian)- and even (bosonic) directions of the four ($2 +
2)$-dimensional compact supermanifold. Some new discrete symmetries are shown
to exist in the superfield formulation. The logical origin for the existence of
BRST- and co-BRST symmetries is shown to be encoded in the Hodge decomposed
versions (of the 2D fermionic vector fields) that are consistent with the
discrete symmetries of the theory.
