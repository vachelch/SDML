DLCQ of Fivebranes, Large N Screening, and L^2 Harmonic Forms on Calabi
  Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We find one explicit L^2 harmonic form for every Calabi manifold. Calabi
manifolds are known to arise in low energy dynamics of solitons in Yang-Mills
theories, and the L^2 harmonic form corresponds to the supersymmetric ground
state. As the normalizable ground state of a single U(N) instanton, it is
related to the bound state of a single D0 to multiple coincident D4's in the
non-commutative setting, or equivalently a unit Kaluza-Klein mode in DLCQ of
fivebrane worldvolume theory. As the ground state of nonabelian massless
monopoles realized around a monopole-``anti''-monopole pair, it shows how the
long range force between the pair is screened in a manner reminiscent of large
N behavior of quark-anti-quark potential found in AdS/CFT correspondence.
