Fluctuating brane in a dilatonic bulk
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a cosmological brane moving in a static five-dimensional bulk
spacetime endowed with a scalar field whose potential is exponential. After
studying various cosmological behaviours for the homogeneous background, we
investigate the fluctuations of the brane that leave spacetime unaffected. A
single mode embodies these fluctuations and obeys a wave equation which we
study for bouncing and ever-expanding branes.
