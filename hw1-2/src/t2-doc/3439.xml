Rotation Symmetry and Nonabelian Berry Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the role of rotational symmetry in the systems where nonabelian
Berry potentials emerge as a result of integrating out fast degrees of freedom.
The conserved angular momentum is constructed in the presence of a non-abelian
Berry potential, which is formulated using Grassmann variables. The
modifications on conventional angular momentum are discussed in close analogy
with monopole systems. The diatomic molecular system discussed by Zygelman is
found to have a similar structure to that of a non-abelian $SU(2)$ charge
coupled to a 't Hooft - Polyakov monopole. The abelian limit of the Berry
potential in diatomic systems is shown to be the same as $U(1)$ monopole and in
a large separation limit, we observe the decoupling associated with a vanishing
field tensor.
