Nonlocal scalar electrodynamics from Chern-Simons theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The theory of a complex scalar interacting with a pure Chern-Simons gauge
field is quantized canonically. Dynamical and nondynamical variables are
separated in a gauge-independent way. In the physical subspace of the full
Hilbert space, this theory reduces to a pure scalar theory with nonlocal
interaction. Several scattering processes are studied and the cross sections
are calculated.
