On the Passage from the Quantum theory to the Semi-Classical theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper an attempt is made to understand the passage from the exact
quantum treatment of the CGHS theory to the semi-classical physics discussed by
many authors. We find first that to the order of accuracy to which Hawking
effects are calculated in the theory, it is inconsistent to ignore correlations
in the dilaton gravity sector. Next the standard Dirac or BRST procedure for
implementing the constraints is followed. This leads to a set of physical
states, in which however the semi-classical physics of the theory seems to be
completely obscured. As an alternative, we construct a coherent state
formalism, which is the natural framework for understanding the semi-classical
calculations, and argue that it satisfies all necessary requirements of the
theory, provided that there exist classical ghost configurations which solve an
infinite set of equations. If this is the case it may be interpreted as a
spontaneous breakdown of general covariance.
