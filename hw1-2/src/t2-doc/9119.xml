Long-lived oscillons from asymmetric bubbles
</title>

<abstract>
  The possibility that extremely long-lived, time-dependent, and localized
field configurations (``oscillons'') arise during the collapse of asymmetrical
bubbles in 2+1 dimensional phi^4 models is investigated. It is found that
oscillons can develop from a large spectrum of elliptically deformed bubbles.
Moreover, we provide numerical evidence that such oscillons are: a) circularly
symmetric; and b) linearly stable against small arbitrary radial and angular
perturbations. The latter is based on a dynamical approach designed to
investigate the stability of nonintegrable time-dependent configurations that
is capable of probing slowly-growing instabilities not seen through the usual
``spectral'' method.
