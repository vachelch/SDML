Radiative Corrections for the Gauged Thirring Model in Causal
  Perturbation Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate the one-loop fermion self-energy for the gauged Thirring model in
(2+1) dimensions, with one massive fermion flavor, in the framework of the
causal perturbation theory. In contrast to QED$_3$, the corresponding two-point
function turns out to be infrared finite on the mass shell. Then, by means of a
Ward identity, we derive the on-shell vertex correction and discuss the role
played by causality for nonrenormalizable theories.
