Obstruction to D-brane topology change
</title>

<abstract>
  A study of the relation between topology change, energy and Lie algebra
representations for fuzzy geometry in connection to $M$-theory is presented. We
encounter two different types of topology change, related to the different
features of the Lie algebra representations appearing in the matrix models of
$M$-theory. From these studies, we propose a new method of obtaining
non-commutative solutions for the non-Abelian $D$-brane action found by Myers.
This mechanism excludes one of the two topology changing processes previously
found in other non-commutative solutions of many matrix-based models in
$M$-theory i.e. in M(atrix) theory, Matrix string theory and non-Abelian
$D$-brane physics.
