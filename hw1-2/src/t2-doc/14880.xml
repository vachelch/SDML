Recent mathematical developments in the Skyrme model

<abstract>
  In this review we present a pedagogical introduction to recent, more
mathematical developments in the Skyrme model. Our aim is to render these
advances accessible to mainstream nuclear and particle physicists. We start
with the static sector and elaborate on geometrical aspects of the definition
of the model. Then we review the instanton method which yields an analytical
approximation to the minimum energy configuration in any sector of fixed baryon
number, as well as an approximation to the surfaces which join together all the
low energy critical points. We present some explicit results for B=2. We then
describe the work done on the multibaryon minima using rational maps, on the
topology of the configuration space and the possible implications of Morse
theory. Next we turn to recent work on the dynamics of Skyrmions. We focus
exclusively on the low energy interaction, specifically the gradient flow
method put forward by Manton. We illustrate the method with some expository toy
models. We end this review with a presentation of our own work on the
semi-classical quantization of nucleon states and low energy nucleon-nucleon
scattering.
