Non-perturbative VEVs from a Local Expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a method for the calculation of vacuum expectation values (VEVs)
given a non-trivial, long-distance vacuum wave functional (VWF) of the kind
that arises, for example, in variational calculations. The VEV is written in
terms of a Schr\"odinger-picture path integral, then a local expansion for (the
logarithm of the) VWF is used. The integral is regulated with an explicit
momentum cut-off, $\Lambda$. The resulting series is not expected to converge
for $\Lambda$ larger than the mass-gap but studying the domain of analyticity
of the VEVs allows us to use analytic continuation to estimate the
large-$\Lambda$ limit. Scalar theory in 1+1 dimensions is analyzed, where (as
in the case of Yang-Mills) we do not expect boundary divergences.
