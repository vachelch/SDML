Supersymmetric Black Holes in $N=8$ Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the embedding of extreme (multi-) dilaton black hole solutions for
the values of the parameter $a=\sqrt{3},1,1/\sqrt{3},0$ in $N=4$ and $N=8$
four-dimensional supergravity. For each black hole solution we find different
embeddings in $N=4$ supergravity which have different numbers of unbroken
supersymmetries. When embedded in $N=8$ supergravity, all different embeddings
of the same solution have the same number of unbroken supersymmetries. Thus,
there is a relation between the value of the parameter $a$ and the number of
unbroken supersymmetries in $N=8$ supergravity, but not in $N=4$, and the
different embeddings must be related by dualities of the $N=8$ theory which are
not dualities of the $N=4$ theory. The only exception in this scheme is a {\it
dyonic} embedding of the $a=0$ black-hole solution which seems to break all
supersymmetries both in the $N=4$ and in the $N=8$ theories.
