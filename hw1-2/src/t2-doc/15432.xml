Strings with Negative Stiffness and Hyperfine Structure
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new string model by adding a higher-order gradient term to the
rigid string, so that the stiffness can be positive or negative without loosing
stability. In the large-D approximation, the model has three phases, one of
which with a new type of generalized "antiferromagnetic" orientational
correlations. We find an infrared-stable fixed point describing world-sheets
with vanishing tension and Hausdorff dimension D_H=2. Crumpling is prevented by
the new term which suppresses configurations with rapidly changing extrinsic
curvature.
