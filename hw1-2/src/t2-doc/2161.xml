Some conclusions for noncritical string theory drawn from two- and
  three-point functions in the Liouville sector
</title>

<abstract>
Starting from the known expression for the three-point correlation functions
for Liouville exponentials with generic real coefficients at we can prove the
Liouville equation of motion at the level of three-point functions. Based on
the analytical structure of the correlation functions we discuss a possible
mass shell condition for excitations of noncritical strings and make some
observations concerning correlators of Liouville fields.
