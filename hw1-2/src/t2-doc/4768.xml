A Family of N=1 SU(N)^k Theories from Branes at Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain N=1 SU(N)^k gauge theories with bifundamental matter and a quartic
superpotential as the low energy theory on D3-branes at singular points. These
theories generalize that on D3-branes at a conifold point, studied recently by
Klebanov and Witten. For k=3 the defining equation of the singular point is
that of an isolated D_4 singularity. For k>3 we obtain a family of multimodular
singularities. The considered SU(N)^k theories flow in the infrared to a
non-trivial fixed point. We analyze the AdS/CFT correspondence for our
examples.
