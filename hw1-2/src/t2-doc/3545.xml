Consistent Perturbative Light Front Formulation of Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how to obtain the consistent light front form quantization of a
non-Abelian pure Yang-Mills theory (gluondynamics) in the framework of the
standard perturbative approach. After a short review of the previous attempts
in the light cone gauge $A_-=0$, it is explained how the difficulties can be
overcome after turning to the anti light cone gauge $A_+=0$. In particular, the
generating functional of the renormalized Green's functions turns out to be the
same as in the conventional instant form approach, leading to the
Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription for the free gluon propagator.
