Explicit solution of the quantum three-body Calogero-Sutherland model
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum integrable systems generalizing Calogero-Sutherland systems were
introduced by Olshanetsky and Perelomov (1977). Recently, it was proved that
for systems with trigonometric potential, the series in the product of two wave
functions is a deformation of the Clebsch-Gordan series. This yields recursion
relations for the wave functions of those systems. In this note, this approach
is used to compute the explicit expressions for the three-body
Calogero-Sutherland wave functions, which are the Jack polynomials. We
conjecture that similar results are also valid for the more general
two-parameters deformation introduced by Macdonald.
