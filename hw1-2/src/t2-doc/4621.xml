Localized anomalies in heterotic orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently spatially localized anomalies have been considered in higher
dimensional field theories. The question of the quantum consistency and
stability of these theories needs further discussion. Here we would like to
investigate what string theory might teach us about theories with localized
anomalies. We consider the Z_3 orbifold of the heterotic E_8 x E_8 theory, and
compute the anomaly of the gaugino in the presence of Wilson lines. We find an
anomaly localized at the fixed points, which depends crucially on the local
untwisted spectra at those points. We show that non-Abelian anomalies cancel
locally at the fixed points for all Z_3 models with or without additional
Wilson lines. At various fixed points different anomalous U(1)s may be present,
but at most one at a given fixed point. It is in general not possible to
construct one generator which is the sole source of the anomalous U(1)s at the
various fixed points.
