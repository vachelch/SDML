Invariant Differential Equations and the Adler-Gel'fand-Dikii Bracket

  In this paper we find an explicit formula for the most general vector
evolution of curves on $RP^{n-1}$ invariant under the projective action of
$SL(n,R)$. When this formula is applied to the projectivization of solution
curves of scalar Lax operators with periodic coefficients, one obtains a
corresponding evolution in the space of such operators. We conjecture that this
evolution is identical to the second KdV Hamiltonian evolution under
appropriate conditions. These conditions give a Hamiltonian interpretation of
general vector differential invariants for the projective action of $SL(n,R)$,
namely, the $SL(n,R)$ invariant evolution can be written so that a general
vector differential invariant corresponds to the Hamiltonian
pseudo-differential operator. We find common coordinates and simplify both
evolutions so that one can attempt to prove the equivalence for arbitrary $n$.
