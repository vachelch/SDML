U(N) Gauge Theory and Lattice Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The U(N) gauge theory on a D-dimensional lattice is reformulated as a theory
of lattice strings (a statistical model of random surfaces). The Boltzmann
weights of the surfaces can have both signs and are tuned so that the
longitudinal modes of the string are elliminated. The U(\infty) gauge theory is
described by noninteracting planar surfaces and the 1/N corrections are
produced by surfaces with higher topology as well as by contact interactions
due to microscopic tubes, trousers, handles, etc. We pay special attention to
the case D=2 where the sum over surfaces can be performed explicitly, and
demonstrate that it reproduces the known exact results for the free energy and
Wilson loops in the continuum limit. In D=4 dimensions, our lattice string
model reproduces the strong coupling phase of the gauge theory. The weak
coupling phase is described by a more complicated string whose world surface
may have windows. A possible integration measure in the space of continuous
surfaces is suggested.
