Speculations on Primordial Magnetic Helicity
</title>

<abstract>
  We speculate that above or just below the electroweak phase transition
magnetic fields are generated which have a net helicity (otherwise said, a
Chern-Simons term) of order of magnitude $N_B + N_L$, where $N_{B,L}$ is the
baryon or lepton number today. (To be more precise requires much more knowledge
of B,L-generating mechanisms than we currently have.) Electromagnetic helicity
generation is associated (indirectly) with the generation of electroweak
Chern-Simons number through B+L anomalies. This helicity, which in the early
universe is some 30 orders of magnitude greater than what would be expected
from fluctuations alone in the absence of B+L violation, should be reasonably
well-conserved through the evolution of the universe to around the times of
matter dominance and decoupling, because the early universe is an excellent
conductor. Possible consequences include early structure formation; macroscopic
manifestations of CP violation in the cosmic magnetic field (measurable at
least in principle, if not in practice); and an inverse-cascade dynamo
mechanism in which magnetic fields and helicity are unstable to transfer to
larger and larger spatial scales. We give a quasi-linear treatment of the
general-relativistic MHD inverse cascade instability, finding substantial
growth for helicity of the assumed magnitude out to scales $\sim
l_M\epsilon^{-1}$, where $\epsilon$ is roughly the B+L to photon ratio and
$l_M$ is the magnetic correlation length. We also elaborate further on an
earlier proposal of the author for generation of magnetic fields above the EW
phase transition.
