Covariant Thermodynamics and ``Realistic'' Friedmann Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a cosmological Friedmann model modified by inclusion of off-shell
matter which has an equation of state $p,\rho \propto T^5,$ $p=1/4\rho .$ Such
matter is shown to have energy density comparable with that of non-interacting
radiation at temperatures of the order of the Hagedorn temperature, $\sim
10^{12}$ K, indicating the possibility of a phase transition. It is argued that
the $T^5$-phase, or an admixture, lies below the high-temperature $T^4$-phase.
