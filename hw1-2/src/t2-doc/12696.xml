On first order formulations of supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
  Supergravities are usually presented in a so-called 1.5 order formulation.
Here we present a general scheme to derive pure 1^{st} order formulations of
supergravities from the 1.5 order ones. The example of N_4=1 supergravity will
be rederived and new results for N_4=2 and N_11=1 will be presented. It seems
that beyond four dimensions the auxiliary fields introduced to obtain first
order formulations of SUGRA theories do not admit supergeometrical
transformation laws at least before a full superfield treatment. On the other
hand first order formalisms simplify eventually symmetry analysis and the study
of dimensional reductions.
