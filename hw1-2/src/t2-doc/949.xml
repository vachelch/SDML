Gauge Theories of Josephson Junction Arrays
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the zero-temperature physics of planar Josephson junction arrays
in the self-dual approximation is governed by an Abelian gauge theory with
periodic mixed Chern-Simons term describing the charge-vortex coupling. The
periodicity requires the existence of (Euclidean) topological excitations which
determine the quantum phase structure of the model. The electric-magnetic
duality leads to a quantum phase transition between a superconductor and a
superinsulator at the self-dual point. We also discuss in this framework the
recently proposed quantum Hall phases for charges and vortices in presence of
external offset charges and magnetic fluxes: we show how the periodicity of the
charge-vortex coupling can lead to transitions to anyon superconductivity
phases. We finally generalize our results to three dimensions, where the
relevant gauge theory is the so-called BF system, with an antisymmetric
Kalb-Ramond gauge field.
