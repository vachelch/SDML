Fractional-Spin Integrals of Motion for the Boundary Sine-Gordon Model
  at the Free Fermion Point
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct integrals of motion (IM) for the sine-Gordon model with boundary
at the free Fermion point which correctly determine the boundary S matrix. The
algebra of these IM (``boundary quantum group'' at q=1) is a one-parameter
family of infinite-dimensional subalgebras of twisted affine sl(2). We also
propose the structure of the fractional-spin IM away from the free Fermion
point.
