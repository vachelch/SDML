Correlation Dynamics of Yukawa-theory in 1+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the method of correlation dynamics we investigate the properties of a
field-theory for fermions and scalar bosons coupled via a Yukawa interaction.
Within this approach, which consists in an expansion of full equal-time Green
functions into connected equal-time Green functions and a corresponding
truncation of the hierarchy of equations of motion we carry out calculations up
to 4th order in the connected Green functions and evaluate the effective
potential of the theory in 1+1 dimensions on a torus. Comparing the different
approximations we find a strong influence of the connected 4-point functions on
the properties of the system.
