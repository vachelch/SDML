Light-cone approach to random surfaces embedded in two dimensions

  We review the recently proposed \lc\ quantization of the matrix model which
is expected to have a critical point describing 2-d quantum gravity coupled to
$c=2$ matter. In the $N\to\infty$ limit, we derive a linear Schroedinger
equation for the free string spectrum. Numerical study of this equation
suggests that the spectrum is tachyonic, and that the string tension diverges
at the critical point.
