Extended Supersymmetry and Self-Duality in 2+2 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The $N=2$ supersymmetric {\it self-dual} Yang-Mills theory and the
$N=4$ and $N=2$ {\it self-dual} supergravities in $2+2$ space-time
dimensions are formulated for the first time. These formulations utilize
solutions of the Bianchi identities subject to the super-Yang-Mills or
supergravity constraints in the relevant $N$-extended superspace with the
space-time signature $(2,2)$.
