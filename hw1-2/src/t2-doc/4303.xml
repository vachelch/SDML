Singleton physics
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the developments in the past twenty years (which are based on our
deformation philosophy of physical theories) dealing with elementary particles
composed of singletons in anti De Sitter space-time. The study starts with the
kinematical aspects (especially for massless particles) and extends to the
beginning of a field theory of composite elementary particles and its relations
with conformal field theory (including very recent developments).
