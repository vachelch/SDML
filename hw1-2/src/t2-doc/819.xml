The Fermion-Boson Mapping in Three Dimensional Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss bosonization in three dimensions by establishing a connection
between the massive Thirring model and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. We
show, to lowest order in inverse fermion mass, the identity between the
corresponding partition functions; from this, a bosonization identity for the
fermion current, valid for length scales long compared with the Compton
wavelength of the fermion, is inferred. We present a non-local operator in the
Thirring model which exhibits fractional statistics.
