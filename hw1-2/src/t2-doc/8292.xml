Entropy bounds and Cardy-Verlinde formula in Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using gauge formulation of gravity the three-dimensional SU(2) YM theory
equations of motion are presented in equivalent form as FRW cosmological
equations. With the radiation, the particular (periodic, big bang-big crunch)
three-dimensional universe is constructed. Cosmological entropy bounds
(so-called Cardy-Verlinde formula) have the standard form in such universe.
Mapping such universe back to YM formulation we got the thermal solution of YM
theory. The corresponding holographic entropy bounds (Cardy-Verlinde formula)
in YM theory are constructed. This indicates to universal character of
holographic relations.
