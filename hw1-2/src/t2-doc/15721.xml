Free Field Realizations of 2D Current Algebras, Screening Currents and
  Primary Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we consider Wakimoto free field realizations of simple affine
Lie algebras, a subject already much studied. We present three new sets of
results. (i) Based on quantizing differential operator realizations of the
corresponding Lie algebras we provide general universal very simple expressions
for all currents, more compact than has been established so far. (ii) We
supplement the treatment of screening currents of the first kind, known in the
literature, by providing a direct proof of the properties for screening
currents of the second kind. Finally (iii) we work out explicit free field
realizations of primary fields with general non-integer weights. We use a
formalism where the (generally infinite) multiplet is replaced by a generating
function primary operator. These results taken together allow setting up
integral representations for correlators of primary fields corresponding to
non-integrable degenerate (in particular admissible) representations.
