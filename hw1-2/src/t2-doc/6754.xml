Cech, Dolbeault and de Rham cohomologies in Chern-Simons and BF theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Topological Chern-Simons (CS) and BF theories and their holomorphic analogues
are discussed in terms of de Rham and Dolbeault cohomologies. We show that Cech
cohomology provides another useful description of the above topological and
holomorphic field theories. In particular, all hidden (nonlocal) symmetries of
non-Abelian CS and BF theories can be most clearly seen in the Cech approach.
We consider multidimensional Manin-Ward integrable systems and describe their
connections with holomorphic BF theories. Dressing symmetries of these generic
integrable systems are briefly discussed.
