<title>
An Early Proposal of "Brane World"
</title>

<abstract>
  Here we place the TeX-typeset version of the old preprint SMC-PHYS-66 (1982),
which was published in K. Akama, "Pregeometry", in Lecture Notes in Physics,
176, Gauge Theory and Gravitation, Proceedings, Nara, 1982, edited by K.
Kikkawa, N. Nakanishi and H. Nariai, (Springer-Verlag) 267--271. In the paper,
we presented the picture that we live in a "brane world" (in the present-day
terminology) i.e. in a dynamically localized 3-brane in a higher dimensional
space. We adopt, as an example, the dynamics of the Nielsen-Olesen vortex type
in six dimensional spacetime to localize our space-time within a 3-brane. At
low energies, everything is trapped in the 3-brane, and the Einstein gravity is
induced through the fluctuations of the 3-brane. The idea is important because
it provides a way basically distinct from the "compactification" to hide the
extra dimensions which become necessary for various theoretical reasons.
