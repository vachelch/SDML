Non-Commutative Instantons and the Seiberg-Witten Map
</title>

<abstract>
  We present several results concerning non-commutative instantons and the
Seiberg-Witten map. Using a simple ansatz we find a large new class of
instanton solutions in arbitrary even dimensional non-commutative Yang-Mills
theory. These include the two dimensional ``shift operator'' solutions and the
four dimensional Nekrasov-Schwarz instantons as special cases. We also study
how the Seiberg-Witten map acts on these instanton solutions. The infinitesimal
Seiberg-Witten map is shown to take a very simple form in operator language,
and this result is used to give a commutative description of non-commutative
instantons. The instanton is found to be singular in commutative variables.
