Non-Central Potentials and Spherical Harmonics Using Supersymmetry and
  Shape Invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the operator methods of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and
the concept of shape invariance can profitably be used to derive properties of
spherical harmonics in a simple way. The same operator techniques can also be
applied to several problems with non-central vector and scalar potentials. As
examples, we analyze the bound state spectra of an electron in a Coulomb plus
an Aharonov-Bohm field and/or in the magnetic field of a Dirac monopole.
