On the Form Factors of Relevant Operators and their Cluster Property
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the Form Factors of the relevant scaling operators in a class of
integrable models without internal symmetries by exploiting their cluster
properties. Their identification is established by computing the corresponding
anomalous dimensions by means of Delfino--Simonetti--Cardy sum--rule and
further confirmed by comparing some universal ratios of the nearby
non--integrable quantum field theories with their independent numerical
determination.
