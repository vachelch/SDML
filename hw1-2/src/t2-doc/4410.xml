Brane-Black Hole Correspondence and Asymptotics of Quantum Spectrum
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the asymptotic properties of quantum states density for
fundamental (super) membrane in the semiclassical approach. The matching of BPS
part of spectrum for superstring and supermembrane gives the possibility to get
stringy results via membrane calculations and vice versa. The brane-black hole
correspondence (on the level of black hole states and brane microstates) is
also studied.
