Supergravity Description of Non-BPS Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct supergravity solutions that correspond to N Dp-branes coinciding
with \bar{N} \bar{Dp}-branes. We study the physical properties of the solutions
and analyse the supergravity description of tachyon condensation. We construct
an interpolation between the brane-antibrane solution and the Schwarzschild
solution and discuss its possible application to the study of
non-supersymmetric black holes.
