A superspace formulation of an "asymptotic" OSp(3,1|2) invariance of
  Yang-Mills theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate a superspace field theory which is shown to be equivalent to the
$c-\bar{c}$ symmetric BRS/Anti-BRS invariant Yang-Mills action. The theory uses
a 6-dimensional superspace and one OSp(3,1|2) vector multiplet of unconstrained
superfields. We establish a superspace WT identity and show that the
formulation has an asymptotic OSp(3,1|2) invariance as the gauge parameter goes
to infinity. We give a physical interpretation of this asymptotic OSp(3,1|2)
invariance as a symmetry transformation among the longitudinal/time like
degrees of freedom of $A_\mu$ and the ghost degrees of freedom.
