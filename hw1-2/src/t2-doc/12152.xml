Aspects of Localized Gravity Around the Soft Minima
</title>

<abstract>
  n-Dimensional pure gravity theory can be obtained as the effective theory of
an n+1 model (with non-compact extra dimension) where general n+1
reparametrization invariance is explicitly broken in the extra dimension. As
was pointed out in the literature, a necessary consistency condition for having
a non-vanishing four dimensional Newton constant is the normalizability in the
extra dimension of the zero mass graviton. This, in turn, implies that gravity
localization is produced around the local minima of a potential in the extra
dimension. We study gravity in the neighborhood of the soft ("thick") local
minima.
