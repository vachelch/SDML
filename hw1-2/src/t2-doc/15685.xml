Hidden Symmetries of the Open N=2 String
</title>

<abstract>
  It is known for ten years that self-dual Yang-Mills theory is the effective
field theory of the open N=2 string in 2+2 dimensional spacetime. We uncover an
infinite set of abelian rigid string symmetries, corresponding to the
symmetries and integrable hierarchy of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The
twistor description of the latter naturally connects with the BRST approach to
string quantization, providing an interpretation of the picture phenomenon in
terms of the moduli space of string backgrounds.
