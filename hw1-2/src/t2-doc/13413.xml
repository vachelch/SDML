Low--Energy Properties of (0,2) Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the low--energy properties of a Z_12 orbifold with continuous
Wilson line moduli. They give rise to a (0,2) superstring compactification.
Their Kaehler potentials and Yukawa couplings are calculated. We study the
discrete symmetries of the model and their implications on the threshold
corrections to the gauge couplings as well as for string unification.
