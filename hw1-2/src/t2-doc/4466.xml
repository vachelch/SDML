Tachyons, Supertubes and Brane/Anti-Brane Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We find supertubes with arbitrary (and not necessarily planar) cross section;
the stability against the D2-brane tension is due to a compensation by the
local momentum generated by Born-Infeld fields. Stability against long-range
supergravity forces is also established. We find the corresponding solutions of
the infinite-N M(atrix) model. The supersymmetric D2/anti-D2 system is a
special case of the general supertube, and we show that there are no
open-string tachyons in this system via a computation of the open-string
one-loop vacuum energy.
