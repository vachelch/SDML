Duality symmetry of the p-form effective action and super trace of the
  twisted de Rham complex
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider quantum p-form fields interacting with a background dilaton. We
calculate the variation with respect to the dilaton of a difference of the
effective actions in the models related by a duality transformation. We show
that this variation is defined essentially by the supertrace of the twisted de
Rham complex. The supertrace is then evaluated on a manifold of an arbitrary
dimension, with or without boundary.
