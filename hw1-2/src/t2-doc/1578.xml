The heat kernel coefficients for the dielectric cylinder
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the \hkks for the \elm field in the background of a dielectric
cylinder with non equal speeds of light inside and outside. The coefficient
 $a_{2}$ whose vanishing makes the vacuum energy of a massless field unique,
turns out to be zero in dilute order, i.e., in order $(\ep-1)^{2}$, and nonzero
beyond. As a consequence, the vanishing of the vacuum energy in the presence of
a dielectric cylinder found by Casimir-Polder summation must take place
irrespectively of the methods by which it might be calculated.
