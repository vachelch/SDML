Stochastic Quantization of Bottomless Systems: Stationary quantities in
  a diffusive process
</title>

<abstract>
  By making use of the Langevin equation with a kernel, it was shown that the
Feynman measure exp(-S) can be realized in a restricted sense in a diffusive
stochastic process, which diverges and has no equilibrium, for bottomless
systems. In this paper, the dependence on the initial conditions and the
temporal behavior are analyzed for 0-dim bottomless systems. Furthermore, it is
shown that it is possible to find stationary quantities.
