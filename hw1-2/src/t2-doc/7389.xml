Axial and gauge anomalies in a theory with one and two-form gauge fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the problem of axial and gauge anomalies in a reducible theory
involving vector and tensor gauge fields coupled in a topological way. We
consider that vector and axial fermionic currents couple with the tensor field
in the same topological manner as the vector gauge one. This kind of coupling
leads to an anomalous axial current, contrarily to the results found in
literature involving other tensor couplings, where no anomaly is obtained.
