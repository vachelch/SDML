Quantum Electrodynamics in the Light-Front Weyl Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine QED(3+1) quantised in the `front form' with finite `volume'
regularisation, namely in Discretised Light-Cone Quantisation. Instead of the
light-cone or Coulomb gauges, we impose the light-front Weyl gauge $A^-=0$. The
Dirac method is used to arrive at the quantum commutation relations for the
independent variables. We apply `quantum mechanical gauge fixing' to implement
Gau{\ss}' law, and derive the physical Hamiltonian in terms of unconstrained
variables. As in the instant form, this Hamiltonian is invariant under global
residual gauge transformations, namely displacements. On the light-cone the
symmetry manifests itself quite differently.
