Supercharges, Killing Spinors and Intersecting Gauge Five-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain new solutions where a string and a pp-wave lie in the common
worldvolume directions of the non-standard intersection of two gauge 5-branes
in the heterotic string. The two 5-branes are supported by independent SU(2)
Yang-Mills instantons in their respective (non-overlapping) transverse spaces.
We present a detailed study of the unbroken supersymmetry, focusing especially
on a comparison between a direct construction of Killing spinors and a counting
of zero eigenvalues in the annticommutator of supercharges. The results are in
agreement with some previous arguments, to the effect that additional zero
eigenvalues resulting from a ``fine-tuning'' between positive-energy and
negative-energy contributions from different components in an intersection are
spurious, and should not be taken as an indication of supersymmetry
enhancements. These observations have a general applicability that goes beyond
the specific example we study in this paper.
