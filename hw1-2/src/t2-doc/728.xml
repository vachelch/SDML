Tree Amplitudes in Noncritical $N=2$ Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent results for tree amplitudes for the $N=2$ noncritical strings are
presented and compared with the critical case. Arguments are given which
indicate a certain discontinuity in passing from the $\hat c < 1$ model (in a
Coulomb gas representation) to the $\hat c = 1$ critical case.
