Bulk and Boundary S Matrices for the SU(N) Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider both closed and open integrable antiferromagnetic chains
constructed with the SU(N)-invariant R matrix. For the closed chain, we extend
the analyses of Sutherland and Kulish-Reshetikhin by considering also complex
``string'' solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations. Such solutions are
essential to describe general multiparticle excited states. We also explicitly
determine the SU(N) quantum numbers of the states. In particular, the model has
particle-like excitations in the fundamental representations [k] of SU(N), with
k = 1, ..., N-1. We directly compute the complete two-particle S matrices for
the cases [1] X [1] and [1] X [N-1]. For the open chain with diagonal boundary
fields, we show that the transfer matrix has the symmetry SU(l) X SU(N-l) X
U(1), as well as a new ``duality'' symmetry which interchanges l and N - l.
With the help of these symmetries, we compute by means of the Bethe Ansatz for
particles of types [1] and [N-1] the corresponding boundary S matrices.
