Static skyrmions in (2+1)-dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In the spirit of previous papers, but using more general field
configurations, the non-linear O(3) model in (2+1)-D, modified by the addition
of both a potential-like term and a Skyrme-like term, is considered. The
instanton solutions are numerically evolved in time and some of their stability
properties studied. They are found to be stable, and a repulsive force is seen
to exist among them. These results, which are restricted to the case of zero
speed systems, confirm those obtained in previous investigations, in which a
similar problem was studied for a different choice of the potential-like term.
