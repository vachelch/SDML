Compactification and Identification of Branes in the Kaluza-Klein
  monopole backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the properties of branes in supergravity theory. We investigate a
class of systems consisting of an M5-brane in the Kaluza-Klein monopole
background with 1/4 supersymmetry in 11-dimensions. In the near core region of
the KK-monopoles, the exact supergravity solution corresponding to each of
these configurations is obtained. Then we argue the compactified 10-dimensional
systems and suggest a way of unambiguous identification of branes in this
background. Here the location of Dirac string type singularity accompanied by
the D6-branes plays an important role. The method is essentially the same as
that of (p,q)5-branes or (p,q)-strings within the 7-brane background in the IIB
theory. We also argue the phenomena of D4-brane creation from D6-branes.
