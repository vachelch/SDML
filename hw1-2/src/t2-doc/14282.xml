Effective Action of the N = 2 Maxwell Multiplet in Harmonic Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We present, in the N=2, D=4 harmonic superspace formalism, a general method
for constructing the off-shell effective action of an N=2 abelian gauge
superfield coupled to matter hypermultiplets. Using manifestly N=2
supersymmetric harmonic supergraph techniques, we calculate the low-energy
corrections to the renormalized one-loop effective action in terms of N=2
(anti)chiral superfield strengths. For a harmonic gauge prepotential with
vanishing vacuum expectation value, corresponding to massless hypermultiplets,
the only non-trivial radiative corrections to appear are non-holomorphic. For a
prepotential with non-zero vacuum value, which breaks the U(1)-factor in the
N=2 supersymmetry automorphism group and corresponds to massive
hypermultiplets, only non-trivial holomorphic corrections arise at leading
order. These holomorphic contribution are consistent with Seiberg's quantum
correction to the effective action, while the first non-holomorphic
contribution in the massless case is the N=2 supersymmetrization of the
Heisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian.
