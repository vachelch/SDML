The Conformal Properties of Liouville Field Theory on Z_N-Riemann
  Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The Liouville field theory on Z_N-Riemann surfaces is studied and it is shown
that it decomposes into a Liouville field theory on the sphere and N-1 free
boson theories. Also, the partition function of the Liouville field theory on
the Z_N-Riemann surfaces is expressed as a product of the correlation function
for the Liouville vertex operators on the sphere and a number of twisted
fields.
