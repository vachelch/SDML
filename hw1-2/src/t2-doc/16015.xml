Zero Mode and Symmetry Breaking on the Light Front
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) on the light front (LF) in
view of the zero mode. We first demonstrate impossibility to remove the zero
mode in the continuum LF theory by two examples: The Lorentz invariance forbids
even a free theory on the LF and the trivial LF vacuum is lost in the SSB
phase, both due to the zero mode as the accumulating point causing
uncontrollable infrared singularity. We then adopt the Discretized Light-Cone
Quantization (DLCQ) which was first introduced by Maskawa and Yamawaki to
establish the trivial LF vacuum and was re-discovered by Pauli and Brodsky in a
different context. It is shown in DLCQ that the SSB phase can be realized on
the trivial LF vacuum only when an explicit symmetry-breaking mass of the
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson m_pi is introduced as an infrared regulator. The
NG-boson zero mode integrated over the LF must exhibit singular behavior sim
1/m_{pi}^2 in the symmetric limit m_{pi} rightarrow 0 in such a way that the LF
charge is not conserved even in the symmetric limit; dot{Q} ne 0. There exists
no NG theorem on the LF. Instead, this singular behavior establishes existence
of the massless NG boson coupled to the current whose charge satisfies Q |0 >=0
and dot{Q} ne 0, in much the same as the NG theorem in the equal-time
quantization which ensures existence of the massless NG boson coupled to the
current whose charge satisfies Q|0 > ne 0 and dot{Q} = 0. We demonstrate such a
peculiarity in a concrete model, the linear sigma model, where the role of
zero-mode constraint is clarified.
