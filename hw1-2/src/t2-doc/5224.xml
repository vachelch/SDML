The Exchange of Orientifold Two-Planes in M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an M-theory lift picture of the exchange of type IIA orientifold
two-planes. This consists in wrapping a M5-brane on a three-cycle in the
transverse space of the M-theory orientifold plane OM2. A flux quantization
condition for the three-form self-dual strength field, which lives on the
worldvolume of the M5-brane is computed, and gives the required extra membrane
charge for the exchange of OM2-planes. Also, we find that the exchange of the
four types of orientifold two-planes has a common picture in M-theory.
Moreover, we find that the assignment of the extra charge is fixed by
cohomology and by the flux quantization of the four-form in M-theory, giving us
the result that cohomology is sufficient to describe some orientifold
properties that at string theory level, just K-theory is able to explain.
