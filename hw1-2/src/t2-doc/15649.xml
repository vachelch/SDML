A three parameter invariant of oriented links
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper defines a new sequence of finite dimensional algebras as quotients
of the group algebras of the braid groups. This sequence depends on three
homogeneous parameters and has a one-parameter family of Markov traces, and so
gives a three parameter invariant of oriented links.
