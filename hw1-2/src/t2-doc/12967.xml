Supergravity spectrum on AdS_2 x S^2
</title>

<abstract>
  The Kaluza-Klein spectrum of N=2, D=4 supergravity compactified on AdS_2 x
S^2 is found and shown to consist of two infinite towers of SU(1,1|2)
representations. In addition to `pure gauge' modes living on the boundary of
AdS which are familiar from higher dimensional cases, in two dimensions there
are modes (e.g. massive gravitons) which enjoy no gauge symmetry yet
nevertheless have no on-shell degrees of freedom in the bulk. We discuss these
two-dimensional subtleties in detail.
