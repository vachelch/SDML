Geometrical Properties of Conformal Field Theories Coupled to
  Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we discuss an approach due to F. David to the geometry of world
sheets of non-critical strings in quasiclassical approximation. The
gravitational dressed conformal dimension is related to the scaling behavior of
the two-point function with respect to a distance variable. We show how this
approach reproduces the standard gravitational dressing in the next order of
perturbation theory. With the same technique we calculate the intrinsic
Hausdorff dimension of a world sheet.
