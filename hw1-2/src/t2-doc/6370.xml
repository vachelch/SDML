Non-Polynomial Realizations of W-Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Relaxing first-class constraint conditions in the usual Drinfeld-Sokolov
Hamiltonian reduction leads, after symmetry fixing, to realizations of W
algebras expressed in terms of all the J-current components. General results
are given for G a non exceptional simple (finite and affine) algebra. Such
calculations directly provide the commutant, in the (closure of) G enveloping
algebra, of the nilpotent subalgebra $G_-$, where the subscript refers to the
chosen gradation in G. In the affine case, explicit expressions are presented
for the Virasoro, $W_3$, and Bershadsky algebras at the quantum level.
