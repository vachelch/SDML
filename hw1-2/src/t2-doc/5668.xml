N=2 Gauge Theories from Wrapped Five-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present string duals of four dimensional N=2 pure SU(N) SYM theory. The
theory is obtained as the low energy limit of D5-branes wrapped on non-trivial
two-cycles. Using seven dimensional gauged supergravity and uplifting the
result to ten dimensions, we obtain solutions corresponding to various points
of the N=2 moduli space. The more symmetric solution may correspond to a point
with rotationally invariant classical vevs. By turning on seven dimensional
scalar fields, we find a solution corresponding to a linear distribution of
vevs. Both solutions are conveniently studied with a D5-probe, which also
confirms many of the standard expectations for N=2 solutions.
