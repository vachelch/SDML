ON THE COVARIANTIZATION OF THE CHIRAL CONSTRAINT
</title>

<abstract>
 We show that a complete covariantization of the chiral constraint in the
Floreanini-Jackiw necessitates an infinite number of auxiliary Wess-Zumino
fields otherwise the covariantization is only partial and unable to remove the
nonlocality in the chiral boson operator. We comment on recent works that claim
to obtain covariantization through the use of Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin method,
that uses just one Wess-Zumino field.
