Conformal Field Theory and Hyperbolic Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the correspondence between the conformal field theory of boundary
operators and two-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. By consideration of domain
boundaries in two-dimensional critical systems, and the invariance of the
hyperbolic length, we motivate a reformulation of the basic equation of
conformal covariance. The scale factors gain a new, physical interpretation. We
exhibit a fully factored form for the three-point function. A doubly-infinite
discrete series of central charges with limit c=-2 is discovered. A
correspondence between the anomalous dimension and the angle of certain
hyperbolic figures emerges. Note: email after 12/19: kleban@maine.maine.edu
