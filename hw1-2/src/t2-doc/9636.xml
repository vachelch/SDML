Two-Dimensional Bosonization from Variable Shifts in the Path Integral
</title>

<abstract>
  A method to perform bosonization of a fermionic theory in (1+1) dimensions in
a path integral framework is developed. The method relies exclusively on the
path integral property of allowing variable shifts, and does not depend on the
explicit form of Greens functions. Two examples, the Schwinger model and the
massless Thirring model, are worked out.
