From Noncommutative Bosonization to S-Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend standard path-integral techniques of bosonization and duality to
the setting of noncommutative geometry. We start by constructing the
bosonization prescription for a free Dirac fermion living in the noncommutative
plane R_\theta^2. We show that in this abelian situation the fermion theory is
dual to a noncommutative Wess-Zumino-Witten model. The non-abelian situation is
also constructed along very similar lines. We apply the techniques derived to
the massive Thirring model on noncommutative R_\theta^2 and show that it is
dualized to a noncommutative WZW model plus a noncommutative cosine potential
(like in the noncommutative Sine-Gordon model). The coupling constants in the
fermionic and bosonic models are related via strong-weak coupling duality. This
is thus an explicit construction of S-duality in a noncommutative field theory.
