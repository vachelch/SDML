Wilson Loops in Noncommutative Yang Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the correlation functions of the Wilson loops in noncommutative
Yang-Mills theory based upon its equivalence to twisted reduced models. We
point out that there is a crossover at the noncommutativity scale. At large
momentum scale, the Wilson loops in noncommmutative Yang-Mills represent
extended objects. They coincide with those in ordinary Yang-Mills theory in low
energy limit. The correlation functions on D-branes in IIB matrix model exhibit
the identical crossover behavior. It is observed to be consistent with the
supergravity description with running string coupling. We also explain that the
results of Seiberg and Witten can be simply understood in our formalism.
