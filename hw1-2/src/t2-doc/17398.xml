Nondiagonal $CP_m$ Coset Models and their Poincar\'E Polynomials
</title>

<abstract>
  $N=2$ coset models of the type $SU(m+1)/SU(m)\times U(1)$ with nondiagonal
modular invariants for both $SU(m+1)$ and $SU(m)$ are considered. Poincar\'e
polynomials of the corresponding chiral rings of these algebras are
constructed. They are used to compute the number of chiral generations of the
associated string compactifications. Moddings by discrete symmetries are also
discussed.
