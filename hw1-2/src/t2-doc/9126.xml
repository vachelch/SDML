Spacetime Dependent Lagrangians and the Vacuum Expectation Value of the
  Higgs field
</title>

<abstract>
  The spacetime dependent lagrangian formalism of references [1-2] is used to
obtain a classical solution of Yang-Mills theory. This is then used to obtain
an estimate of the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, viz.
$\phi_{a}=A/e$, where $A$ is a constant and $e$ is the Yang-Mills coupling
(related to the usual electric charge). The solution can also accommodate
non-commuting coordinates on the boundary of the theory which may be used to
construct D-brane actions.
