Supersymmetry breaking in M-theory and gaugino condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that supersymmetry breaking by gaugino condensation in the strongly
coupled heterotic string can be described by an analogue of Scherk-Schwarz
compactification on the eleventh dimension in M-theory. The M-theory scale is
identified with the gauge coupling unification mass, whereas the radius of the
eleventh dimension $\rho$ is at an intermediate scale $\rho^{-1}\sim 10^{12}$
GeV. At the lowest order, supersymmetry is broken only in the gravitational and
moduli sector at a scale $m_{3/2}\sim\rho^{-1}$, while it is mediated by
gravitational interactions to the observable world. Computation of the mass
splittings yields in general a hierarchy of soft masses at the TeV scale
$(\sim\rho^{-2}/M_p)$ with matter scalars much heavier than gauginos.
