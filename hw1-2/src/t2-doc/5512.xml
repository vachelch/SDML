Extended Operator Algebra and Reducibility in the WZW Permutation
  Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently the operator algebra, including the twisted affine primary fields,
and a set of twisted KZ equations were given for the WZW permutation orbifolds.
In the first part of this paper we extend this operator algebra to include the
so-called orbifold Virasoro algebra of each WZW permutation orbifold. These
algebras generalize the orbifold Virasoro algebras (twisted Virasoro operators)
found some years ago in the cyclic permutation orbifolds. In the second part,
we discuss the reducibility of the twisted affine primary fields of the WZW
permutation orbifolds, obtaining a simpler set of single-cycle twisted KZ
equations. Finally we combine the orbifold Virasoro algebra and the
single-cycle twisted KZ equations to investigate the spectrum of each orbifold,
identifying the analogues of the principal primary states and fields also seen
earlier in cyclic permutation orbifolds. Some remarks about general WZW
orbifolds are also included.
