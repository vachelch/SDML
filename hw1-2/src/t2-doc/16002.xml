Absence of higher order corrections to the non-Abelian Chern-Simons
  coefficient

<abstract>
  We extend the Coleman-Hill analysis to non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories
containing a tree level topological mass term. We show, in the case of a pure
Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory, that there are no corrections to the
coefficient of the Chern-Simons term beyond one loop in the axial gauge. Our
arguments use constraints coming only from small gauge Ward identities as well
as the analyticity of the amplitudes, much like the proof in the Abelian case.
Some implications of this result are also discussed.
