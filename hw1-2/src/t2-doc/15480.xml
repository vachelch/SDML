Non-local symmetries of the closed N=2 string
</title>

<abstract>
  By carefully analysing the picture-dependence of the BRST cohomology an
infinite set of symmetry charges of the closed N=2 string is identified. The
transformation laws of the physical vertex operators are shown to coincide with
the linearised non-local symmetries of the Plebanski equation (which is the
effective field theory of the closed N=2 string). Moreover, the corresponding
Ward identities are powerful enough to allow for a rederivation of the well
known vanishing theorem for the tree-level correlation functions with more than
three external legs.
