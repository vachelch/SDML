  Closed string tachyon condensation resolves the singularities of
nonsupersymmetric orbifolds, however the resolved space typically has fewer
D-brane charges than that of the orbifold. The description of the tachyon
condensation process via a gauged linear sigma model enables one to track the
topology as one passes from the sigma model's ``orbifold phase'' to its
resolved, ``geometric phase,'' and thus to follow how the D-brane charges
disappear from the effective spacetime dynamics. As a mathematical consequence,
our results point the way to a formulation of a ``quantum McKay
correspondence'' for the resolution of toric orbifold singularities.
