Supersymmetry, Trace Anomaly and Naked Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss stationary supersymmetric bosonic configurations of the
Einstein-Maxwell theory embedded in $N=2$ supergravity. Some of these
configurations, including the Kerr-Newman solutions with $m = |q|$ and
arbitrary angular momentum per unit mass $a$, exhibit naked singularities.
However, $N=2$ supergravity has trace anomaly. The nonvanishing anomalous
energy-momentum tensor of these Kerr-Newman solutions violates a consistency
condition for a configuration to admit unbroken supersymmetry. Thus, the trace
anomaly of this theory prevents the supersymmetric solutions from exhibiting
naked singularities.
