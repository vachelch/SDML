Anomaly of (2,0) Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute gravitational and axial anomaly for D-type (2,0) theories realized
on N pairs of coincident M5-branes at R^5/Z_2 orbifold fixed point. We first
summarize work by Harvey, Minasian, and Moore on A-type (2,0) theories, and
then extend it to include the effect of orbifold fixed point. The net anomaly
inflow follows when we further take into account the consistency of T^5/Z_2
M-theory orbifold. We deduce that the world-volume anomaly is given by N{\cal
J}_8 + N(2N-1)(2N-2) p_2/24 where {\cal J}_8 is the anomaly polynomial of a
free tensor multiplet and p_2 is the second Pontryagin class associated with
the normal bundle. This result is in accord with Intriligator's conjecture.
