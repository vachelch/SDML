Characters for Coset Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve the Kac-Moody branching equation to obtain explicit formulae for the
characters of coset conformal field theories and then apply these to specific
examples to determine the integer shift of the conformal weights of primary
fields. We also present an example of coset conformal field theory which cannot
be described by the identification current method.
