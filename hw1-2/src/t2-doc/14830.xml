Canonical approach to 2D supersymmetric WZNW model coupled to
  supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the known representation of the Kac-Moody algebra in terms of
the coordinates and momenta, we extend it to the representation of the super
Kac-Moody and super Virasoro algebras. Then we use general canonical method to
construct an action invariant under local gauge symmetries, where components of
the super energy-momentum tensor $L_\pm$ and $G_\pm$ play the role of the
diffeomorphisms and supersymmetries generators respectively. We obtain
covariant extension of WZNW theory with respect to local supersymmetry as well
as explicit expressions for gauge transformations.
