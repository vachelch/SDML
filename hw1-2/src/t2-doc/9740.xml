Duality in Quantum Toda theory and W-algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Quantum Toda theory associated to a general Lie algebra. We prove
that the conserved quantities in both conformal and affine Toda theories
exhibit duality interchanging the Dynkin diagram and its dual, and inverting
the coupling constant. As an example we discuss the conformal Toda theories
based on $B_2,B_3$ and $G_2$ and the related affine theories.
