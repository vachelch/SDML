Continuous and discrete global anomalies and the null-cone of
  supersymmetric gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A stronger version of an anomaly matching theorem is proven. It allows to
anticipate the matching of continuous and discrete global anomalies, and can be
applied at field configurations where the gauge group is not necessarily
completely broken. The theorem is used to show that discrete anomaly matching
is mathematically unrelated to continuous anomaly matching and thus offer a
truly independent test on a given spectrum. It is also applied to the wide
class of theories with unconstrained basic gauge invariants, including theories
with an affine moduli space and theories in a Coulomb phase, for which an
interesting connection is found between anomaly matching and the geometry of
the null-cone, the union set of orbits of the complexified gauge group $G^c$
having zero in its boundary. The existence of $G^c$ orbits of maximum dimension
in the null-cone implies the matching of continuous anomalies (between the
elementary fields and the basic invariants), whereas the distance to the origin
of weight space of a hyperplane containing the weights of a point in such an
orbit determines the matching of discrete anomalies. The examples worked out in
detail are SO(N) with a symmetric tensor, SO(N) with (N-4) vectors, the ISS
model, SO(N) with (N-3) vectors, and the Seiberg Witten theories, one flavor of
matter in the adjoint of a simple gauge group.
