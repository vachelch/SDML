The Yang--Baxter Symmetry in Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a review on infinite non-abelian symmetries in two-dimensional field
theories. We show how any integrable QFT enjoys the existence of infinitely
many {\bf conserved} charges. These charges {\bf do not commute} between them
and satisfy a Yang--Baxter algebra. They are generated by quantum monodromy
operators and provide a representation of $q-$deformed affine Lie algebras
$U_q({\hat\G})$. We review the work by de Vega, Eichenherr and Maillet on the
bootstrap construction of the quantum monodromy operators in classically scale
invariant theories where the classical monodromy matrix is conserved. Then, the
recent generalization to the sine--Gordon (or massive Thirring) model, where
such operators do not possess a classical analogue is given (This provides a
representation of $S{\hat U}(2)_q$). It is then reported on the recent work by
Destri and de Vega, where both commuting and non-commuting integrals of motion
are systematically obtained by Bethe Ansatz in the light-cone approach. The
eigenvalues of the six--vertex alternating transfer matrix $\tau(\l)$ are
explicitly computed on a generic physical state through algebraic Bethe ansatz.
In the thermodynamic limit $\tau(\l)$ turns out to be a two--valued periodic
function. One determination generates the local abelian charges, including
energy and momentum, while the other yields the abelian subalgebra of the
(non--local) YB algebra. In particular, the bootstrap results coincide with the
ratio between the two determinations of the lattice transfer matrix.[Based on a
Lecture at the Clausthal Symposium].
