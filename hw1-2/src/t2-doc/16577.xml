Elliptic quantum many-body problem and double affine
  Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The elliptic-matrix quantum Olshanetsky-Perelomov problem is introduced for
arbitrary root systems by means of an elliptic generalization of the Dunkl
operators. Its equivalence with the double affine generalization of the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation (in the induced representations) is
established.
