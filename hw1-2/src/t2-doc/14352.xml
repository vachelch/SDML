$N=4$ super KdV equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct $N=4$ supersymmetric KdV equation as a hamiltonian flow on the
$N=4\;SU(2)$ super Virasoro algebra. The $N=4$ KdV superfield, the hamiltonian
and the related Poisson structure are concisely formulated in $1D \;N=4$
harmonic superspace. The most general hamiltonian is shown to necessarily
involve $SU(2)$ breaking parameters which are combined in a traceless rank 2
$SU(2)$ tensor. First nontrivial conserved charges of $N=4$ super KdV (of
dimensions 2 and 4) are found to exist if and only if the $SU(2)$ breaking
tensor is a bilinear of some $SU(2)$ vector with a fixed length proportional to
the inverse of the central charge of $N=4\;SU(2)$ algebra. After the reduction
to $N=2$ this restricted version of $N=4$ super KdV goes over to the $a=4$
integrable case of $N=2$ super KdV and so is expected to be integrable. We show
that it is bi-hamiltonian like its $N=2$ prototype.
