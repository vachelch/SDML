Park--Tarter Matrix for a Dyon--Dyon System
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of separation of variables in a dyon--dyon system is discussed. A
linear transformation is obtained between fundamental bases of this system.
Comparison of the dyon--dyon system with a 4D isotropic oscillator is carried
out.
