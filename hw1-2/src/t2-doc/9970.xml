Massive-Scalar Absorption by Extremal p-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the absorption probability of minimally-coupled massive scalars by
extremal p-branes. In particular, we find that the massive scalar wave equation
under the self-dual string background has the same form as the massless scalar
wave equation under the dyonic string background. Thus it can be cast into the
form of a modified Mathieu equation and solved exactly. Another example that we
can solve exactly is that of the D=4 two-charge black hole with equal charges,
for which we obtain the closed-form absorption probability. We also obtain the
leading-order absorption probabilities for D3-, M2- and M5-branes.
