The Galilean Nature of V-duality for Noncommutative Open String and
  Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A V-duality conjecture for noncommutative open string theories (NCOS) that
result from decoupling D-branes in Lorentz-boost related backgrounds was put
forward recently in hep-th/0006013. The aim of this paper is to test the
Galilean nature of this conjecture in the gravity dual setup. We start with an
(F, D3) bound state Lorentz-boosted along one D3-brane direction perpendicular
to the F-string, and show that insisting a decoupled NCOS allows only
infinitesimal Lorentz boosts. In this way, it is shown that the V-duality
relates a family of NCOS by Galileo boosts. Starting with a Lorentz-boosted
(D1,D3) bound state, we show that a similar V-duality works for noncommutative
Yang-Mills (NCYM) theories as well. In addition, we deduce by a holography
argument that the running string tension, as a function of the energy scale,
for NCOS (or NCYM) remains unchanged under V-duality.
