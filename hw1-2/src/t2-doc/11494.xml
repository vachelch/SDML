The Exact Mass-Gap of the Supersymmetric CP^{n-1} Sigam Model
</title>

<abstract>
  A formula for the mass-gap of the supersymmetric $\CP^{n-1}$ sigma model ($n
> 1$) in two dimensions is derived: $m/\Lambda_{\overline{\rm
MS}}=\sin(\pi\Delta)/(\pi\Delta)$ where $\Delta=1/n$ and $m$ is the mass of the
fundamental particle multiplet. This result is obtained by comparing two
expressions for the free-energy density in the presence of a coupling to a
conserved charge; one expression is computed from the exact S-matrix of
K\"oberle and Kurak via the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz and the other is
computed using conventional perturbation theory. These calculations provide a
stringent test of the S-matrix, showing that it correctly reproduces the
universal part of the beta-function and resolving the problem of CDD
ambiguities.
