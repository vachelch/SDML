(4,4) superfield supergravity

<abstract>
  We present the N=4 superspace constraints for the two-dimensional (2d)
off-shell (4,4) supergravity with the superfield strengths expressed in terms
of a (4,4) twisted (scalar) multiplet TM-I, as well as the corresponding
component results, in a form suitable for applications. The constraints are
shown to be invariant under the N=4 super-Weyl transformations, whose N=4
superfield parameters form another twisted (scalar) multiplet TM-II. To solve
the constraints, we propose the Ansatz which makes the N=4 superconformal
flatness of the N=4 supergravity curved superspace manifest. The locally (4,4)
supersymmetric TM-I matter couplings, with the potential terms resulting from
spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, are constructed. We also find the full
(4,4) superconformally invariant (improved) TM-II matter action. The latter can
be extended to the (4,4) locally supersymmetric Liouville action which is
suitable for describing (4,4) supersymmetric non-critical strings.
