Runge-Lenz operator for Dirac field in Taub-NUT background
</title>

<abstract>
  Fermions in D=4 self-dual Euclidean Taub-NUT space are investigated.
Dirac-type operators involving Killing-Yano tensors of the Taub-NUT geometry
are explicitly given showing that they anticommute with the standard Dirac
operator and commute with the Hamiltonian as it is expected. They are connected
with the hidden symmetries of the space allowing the construction of a
conserved vector operator analogous to the Runge-Lenz vector of the Kepler
problem. This operator is written down pointing out its algebraic properties.
