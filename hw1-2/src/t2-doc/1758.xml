Scherk-Schwarz SUSY Breaking in Noncommutative Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by a recent conjecture [1] that quantum corrections and the UV/IR
connection modify the classical relation between SUSY breaking and the
cosmological constant to the phenomenologically acceptable : $M_{SUSY} \sim M_P
(\Lambda /M_P^4)^{1/8}$, we study SUSY breaking by boundary conditions in
noncommutative field theories. In commutative field theory the violations of
SUSY are finite and vanish as the inverse fourth power of the radius of the
SUSY violating circle. We show that in the noncommutative theory, as a
consequence of its UV/IR connection, the perturbative corrections to SUSY
breaking are infinite. We have not yet performed the nonperturbative
resummations to extract the true behavior of the system.
