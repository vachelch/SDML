Hamiltonian Flow Equations for a Dirac Particle in an External Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive and solve the Hamiltonian flow equations for a Dirac particle in an
external static potential. The method shows a general procedure for the set up
of continuous unitary transformations to reduce the Hamiltonian to a
quasidiagonal form.
