The Operator Product Expansion for Wilson Loops and Surfaces in the
  Large N Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  The operator product expansion for ``small'' Wilson loops in {\cal N}=4, d=4
SYM is studied. The OPE coefficients are calculated in the large N and g_{YM}^2
N limit by exploiting the AdS/CFT correspondence. We also consider Wilson
surfaces in the (0,2), d=6 superconformal theory. In this case, we find that
the UV divergent terms include a term proportional to the rigid string action.
