Extrinsic Curvature Induced 2-d Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Abtract: 2-dimensional fermions are coupled to extrinsic geometry of a
conformally immersed surface in ${\bf R}^3$ through gauge coupling. By
integrating out the fermions, we obtain a WZNW action involving extrinsic
curvature of the surface. Restricting the resulting effective action to
surfaces of $h\sqrt g=1$, an explicit form of the action invariant under
Virasaro symmetry is obtained. This action is a sum of the geometric action for
the Virasaro group and the light-cone action of 2-d gravity plus an interaction
term. The central charges of the theory in both the left and right sectors are
calculated.
