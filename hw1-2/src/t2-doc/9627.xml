On the AdS/CFT Dual of Deconstruction
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a class of non-supersymmetric gauge theories obtained by
orbifolding the N=4 super-Yang-Mills theories. We focus on the resulting quiver
theories in their deconstructed phase, both at small and large coupling, where
a fifth dimension opens up. In particular we investigate the r\^ole played by
this extra dimension when evaluating the rectangular Wilson loops encoding the
interaction potential between quarks located at different points in the
orbifold. The large coupling potential of the deconstructed quiver theory is
determined using the AdS/CFT correspondence and analysing the corresponding
minimal surface solution for the dual gravitational metric. At small coupling,
the potential between quarks decreases with their angular distance while at
strong coupling we find a linear dependence at large distance along the
(deconstructed) fifth dimension.
