Bosonic Super Liouville System: Lax Pair and Solution
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the bosonic super Liouville system which is a statistical
transmutation of super Liouville system. Lax pair for the bosonic super
Liouville system is constructed using prolongation method, ensuring the Lax
integrability, and the solution to the equations of motion is also considered
via Leznov-Saveliev analysis.
