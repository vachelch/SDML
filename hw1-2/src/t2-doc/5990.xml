Bogomolnyi Bound with a Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  Bogomolnyi-type bound is constructed for the topological solitons in O(3)
nonlinear $\sigma$ model coupled to gravity with a negative cosmological
constant. Spacetimes made by self-dual solutions form a class of G\"{o}del-type
universe. In the limit of a spinless massive point particle, the obtained
stationary metric does not violate the causality and it is a new point particle
solution different from the known static hyperboloid and black hole. We also
showed that static Nielsen-Olesen vortices saturate Bogomolnyi-type bound only
when the cosmological constant vanishes.
