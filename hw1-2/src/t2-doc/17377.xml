Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in the Space-time of an Arbitrary
  Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new scenario to implement spontaneous symmetry breaking in the
space-time of an arbitrary dimension (D>2) by introducing the non-minimal
coupling between the scalar field and the gravity. In this scenario, the usage
of the familiar lambda Phi ^4 term, which is non-renormalizable for D >= 5, can
be avoided altogether.
