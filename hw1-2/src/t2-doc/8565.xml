Some semi-classical issues in boundary sine-Gordon model
</title>

<abstract>
  The semi-classical quantisation of the two lowest energy static solutions of
boundary sine-Gordon model is considered. A relation between the Lagrangian and
bootstrap parameters is established by comparing their quantum corrected energy
difference and the exact one. This relation is also confirmed by studying the
semi-classical limit of soliton reflections on the boundary.
