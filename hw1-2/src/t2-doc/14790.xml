Schwinger-Dyson Equation, Area Law and Chiral Symmetry in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  A Schwinger-Dyson equation for the quark propagator is derived in the context
of a Bethe-Salpeter second order formalism developped in preceding papers and
of the Minimal Area Law model for the evaluation of the Wilson loop. We discuss
how the equal time straight line approximation has to be modified to include
correctly trajectories going backwards in time. We also show, by an appropriate
selection of the solution of the SD equation, that in the limit of zero quark
mass chiral symmetry breaking and a zero mass pseudoscalar meson actually
occur. The inclusion of backward quark trajectories proves to be essential to
make the model consistent with Goldstone's theorem.
