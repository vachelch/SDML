Conformally Invariant Off-shell Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent advances in non-critical string theory allow a unique continuation of
critical Polyakov string amplitudes to off-shell momenta, while preserving
conformal invariance. These continuations possess unusual, apparently stringy,
characteristics, as we illustrate with our results for three-point functions.
