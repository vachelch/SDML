Topological Entanglement of Polymers and Chern-Simons Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In recent times some interesting field theoretical descriptions of the
statistical mechanics of entangling polymers have been proposed by various
authors. In these approaches, a single test polymer fluctuating in a background
of static polymers or in a lattice of obstacles is considered. The extension to
the case in which the configurations of two or more polymers become non-static
is not straightforward unless their trajectories are severely constrained. In
this paper we present another approach, based on Chern--Simons field theory,
which is able to describe the topological entanglements of two fluctuating
polymers in terms of gauge fields and second quantized replica fields.
