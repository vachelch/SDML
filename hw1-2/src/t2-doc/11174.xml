  The paper contains successive description of the strong-coupling perturbation
theory. Formal realization of the idea is based on observation that the
path-integrals measure for absorption part of amplitudes $\R$ is Diracian
($\d$-like). New form of the perturbation theory achieved mapping the quantum
dynamics in the space $W_G$ of (action, angle) type collective variables. It is
shown that the transformed perturbation theory contributions are accumulated on
the boundary $\pa W_G$, i.e. are sensible to the $topology$ of factor space
$W_G$ and,therefore, to the theory symmetry group $G$. The abilities of our
perturbation theory are illustrated by examples from quantum mechanics and
field theory. Considering the Coulomb potential $1/|x|$ the total reduction of
quantum degrees of freedom is demonstrated mapping the dynamics in the (angle,
angular momentum, Runge-Lentz vector) space. To solve the (1+1)-dimensional
sin-Gordon model the theory is considered in the space (coordinates, momenta)
of solitons. It is shown the total reduction of quantum degrees of freedom and,
in result, there is not multiple production of particles. This result we
interpret as the $S$-matrix form of confinement. The scalar $O(4,2)$-invariant
field theoretical model is quantized in the $W_O=O(4,2)/O(4) {\times} O(2)$
factor manifold. It is shown that the corresponding $\R$ is nontrivial because
of the scale invariance breaking.
