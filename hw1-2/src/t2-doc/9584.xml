Post-Classicism in Tree Amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a short and simple introduction into perturbiners, that is, the
solutions of field equations which are generating functions for tree
amplitudes. The perturbiners have been constructed in Yang-Mills, in SUSY
Yang-Mills, in gravity, and in sin(h)-Gordon.
