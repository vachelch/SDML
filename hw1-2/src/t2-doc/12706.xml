Gonihedric String Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the basic properties of the gonihedric string and the problem of
its formulation in continuum. We propose a generalization of the Dirac equation
and of the corresponding gamma matrices in order to describe the gonihedric
string. The wave function and the Dirac matrices are infinite-dimensional. The
spectrum of the theory consists of particles and antiparticles of increasing
half-integer spin lying on quasilinear trajectories of different slope.
Explicit formulas for the mass spectrum allow to compute the string tension and
thus demonstrate the string character of the theory.
