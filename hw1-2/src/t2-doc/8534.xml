Reshetikhin's Formula for the Jones Polynomial of a Link: Feynman
  diagrams and Milnor's Linking Numbers
</title>

<abstract>
  We use Feynman diagrams to prove a formula for the Jones polynomial of a link
derived recently by N.~Reshetikhin. This formula presents the colored Jones
polynomial as an integral over the coadjoint orbits corresponding to the
representations assigned to the link components. The large $k$ limit of the
integral can be calculated with the help of the stationary phase approximation.
The Feynman rules allow us to express the phase in terms of integrals over the
manifold and the link components. Its stationary points correspond to flat
connections in the link complement. We conjecture a relation between the
dominant part of the phase and Milnor's linking numbers. We check it explicitly
for the triple and quartic numbers by comparing their expression through the
Massey product with Feynman diagram integrals.
