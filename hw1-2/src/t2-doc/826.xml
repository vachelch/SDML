Weak decay of swirling protons and other processes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the weak-interaction emission of spin-1/2 fermions from
decaying (and non-decaying) particles endowed with uniform circular motion. The
decay of swirling protons and the neutrino- antineutrino emission from
circularly moving electrons are analyzed in some detail. The relevance of our
results to astrophysics is commented.
