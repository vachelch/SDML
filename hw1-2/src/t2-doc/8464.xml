A Numerical Experiment in DLCQ: Microcausality, Continuum Limit and all
  that
</title>

<abstract>
  Issues related with microcausality violation and continuum limit in the
context of (1+1) dimensional scalar field theory in discretized light-cone
quantization (DLCQ) are addressed in parallel with discretized equal time
quantization (DETQ) and the fact that Lorentz invariance and microcausality are
restored if one can take the continuum limit properly is emphasized. In the
free case, it is shown with numerical evidence that the continuum results can
be reproduced from DLCQ results for the Pauli-Jordan function and the real part
of Feynman propagator. The contributions coming from $k^+$ near zero region in
these cases are found to be very small in contrast to the common belief that
$k^+=0$ is an accumulation point. In the interacting case, aspects related to
the continuum limit of DLCQ results in perturbation theory are discussed.
