Correlation Functions in the Two-dimensional Ising Model in a Magnetic
  Field at $T=T_c$
</title>

<abstract>
  The one and two-particle form factors of the energy operator in the
two-dimensional Ising model in a magnetic field at $T=T_c$ are exactly computed
within the form factor bootstrap approach. Together with the matrix elements of
the magnetisation operator already computed in ref.\,\cite{immf}, they are used
to write down the large distance expansion for the correlators of the two
relevant fields of the model.
