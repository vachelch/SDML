Irreducible Hamiltonian BRST analysis of Stueckelberg coupled p-form
  gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The irreducible Hamiltonian BRST symmetry for p-form gauge theories with
Stueckelberg coupling is derived. The cornerstone of our approach is
represented by the construction of an irreducible theory that is equivalent
from the point of view of the BRST formalism with the original system. The
equivalence makes permissible the substitution of the BRST quantization of the
reducible model by that of the irreducible theory. Our procedure maintains the
Lorentz covariance of the irreducible path integral.
