Cohomological Quantum Mechanics And Calculability Of Observables
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider quantum mechanical systems based on the classical action being
the period of a one form over a cycle and elucidate three main points. First we
show that the prepotenial V is no longer completely arbitrary but obeys a
consistency integral equation. That is the one form dV defines the same period
as the classical action. We then apply this to the case of the punctured plane
for which the prepotential is of the form $V= \alpha \theta + \Phi ( \theta )$.
The function $ \Phi $ is any but a periodic function of the polar angle. For
the topological information to be preserved, we further require that $ \Phi $
be even. Second we point out the existence of a hidden scale which comes from
the regularization of the infrared behaviour of the solutions. This will then
be used to eliminate certain invariants preselected on dimensional counting
grounds. Then provided we discard nonperiodic solutions as being non physical
we compute the expectation values of the BRST- exact observables with the
general form of the prepotential using only the orthonormality of the solutions
(periodic). Third we give topological interpretations of the invariants in
terms of the topological invariants wich live naturally on the punctured
plane as the winding number and the fundamental group of homotopy,but this
requires a prior twisting of the homotopy structure.
