$Z_n$ Baxter Models and Quantum Symmetric Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The scattering of two excitations (both of the simplest kind) in the magnetic
model related to the $Z_n$\--Baxter model is naturally described for $n
\rightarrow \infty$ in terms of the Macdonald polynomials for root system
$A_1$. These polynomials play the role of zonal spherical functions for a two
parameter family of quantum symmetric spaces. These spaces ``interpolate''
between various $p$\--adic and real symmetric spaces.
