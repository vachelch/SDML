String theory extensions of Einstein-Maxwell fields: the static case
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new approach for generation of solutions in the four-dimensional
heterotic string theory with one vector field and in the five-dimensional
bosonic string theory starting from the static Einstein-Maxwell fields. Our
approach allows one to construct the solution classes invariant with respect to
the total subgroup of the three-dimensional charging symmetries of these string
theories. The new generation procedure leads to the extremal
Israel-Wilson-Perjes subclass of string theory solutions in a special case and
provides its natural continuous extension to the realm of non-extremal
solutions. We explicitly calculate all string theory solutions related to
three-dimensional gravity coupled to an effective dilaton field which arises
after an appropriate charging symmetry invariant reduction of the static
Einstein-Maxwell system.
