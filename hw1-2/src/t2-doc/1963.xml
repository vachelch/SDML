Divergences of Discrete States Amplitudes and Effective Lagrangian in 2D
  String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Scattering amplitudes for discrete states in 2D string theory are considered.
Pole divergences of tree-level amplitudes are extracted and residues are
interpreted as renormalized amplitudes for discrete states. An effective
Lagrangian generating renormalized amplitudes for open string is written and
corresponding Ward identities are presented. A relation of this Lagrangian with
homotopy Lie algebra is discussed.
