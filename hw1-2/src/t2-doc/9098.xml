Osp(1|2) Chern-Simons gauge theory as 2D N=1 Induced Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the close relationship between Chern-Simons gauge theory with
gauge group Osp(1|2) and N=1 induced supergravity in two dimensions. More
precisely, the inner product of the physical states in the former yields the
partition function of the latter evaluated in the Wess-Zumino supergauge. It is
also shown that the moduli space of flat Osp(1|2) connections naturally
includes super Teichm\"uller space of super Riemann surfaces.
