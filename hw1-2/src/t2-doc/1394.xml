Gravitational instability in higher dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore a classical instability of spacetimes of dimension $D>4$. Firstly,
we consider static solutions: generalised black holes and brane world metrics.
The dangerous mode is a tensor mode on an Einstein base manifold of dimension
$D-2$. A criterion for instability is found for the generalised Schwarzschild,
AdS-Schwarzschild and topological black hole spacetimes in terms of the
Lichnerowicz spectrum on the base manifold. Secondly, we consider perturbations
in time-dependent solutions: Generalised dS and AdS. Thirdly we show that,
subject to the usual limitations of a linear analysis, any Ricci flat spacetime
may be stabilised by embedding into a higher dimensional spacetime with
cosmological constant. We apply our results to pure AdS black strings. Finally,
we study the stability of higher dimensional ``bubbles of nothing''.
