A Krichever--Novikov Formulation of W--Algebras on Riemann Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how the theory of classical $W$--algebras can be formulated on a
higher genus Riemann surface in the spirit of Krichever and Novikov. An
intriguing relation between the theory of $A_1$ embeddings into simple Lie
algebras and the holomorphic geometry of Riemann surfaces is exihibited.
