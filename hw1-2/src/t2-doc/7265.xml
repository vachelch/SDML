Geometric Engineering of Seiberg-Witten Theories with Massive
  Hypermultiplets

  We analyze the geometric engineering of the N=2 SU(2) gauge theories with
$1\leq N_f\leq 3$ massive hypermultiplets in the vector representation. The set
of partial differential equations satisfied by the periods of the
Seiberg-Witten differential is obtained from the Picard-Fuchs equations of the
local B-model. The differential equations and its solutions are consistent with
the massless case. We show that the Yukawa coupling of the local A-model gives
rise to the correct instanton expansion in the gauge theory, and propose the
pattern of the distribution of the world-sheet instanton number from it. As a
side result, we obtain the asymptotic form of the instanton number in the gauge
theories with massless hypermultiplets.
