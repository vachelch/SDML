Vacuum decay and internal symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effects of internal symmetries on the decay by bubble nucleation
of a metastable false vacuum. The zero modes about the bounce solution that are
associated with the breaking of continuous internal symmetries result in an
enhancement of the tunneling rate into vacua in which some of the symmetries of
the initial state are spontaneously broken. We develop a general formalism for
evaluating the effects of these zero modes on the bubble nucleation rate in
both flat and curved space-times.
