Unification of spins and charges in Grassmann space and in space of
  differential forms
</title>

<abstract>
  Polynomials in Grassmann space can be used to describe all the internal
degrees of freedom of spinors, scalars and vectors, that is their spins and
charges. It was shown that K\"ahler spinors, which are polynomials of
differential forms, can be generalized to describe not only spins of spinors
but also spins of vectors as well as spins and charges of scalars, vectors and
spinors. If the space (ordinary and noncommutative) has 14 dimensions or more,
the appropriate spontaneous break of symmetry leads gravity in $d$ dimensions
to manifest in four dimensional subspace as ordinary gravity and all needed
gauge fields as well as the Yukawa couplings. Both approaches, the K\"ahler's
one (if generalized) and our, manifest four generations of massless fermions,
which are left handed SU(2) doublets and right handed SU(2) singlets. In this
talk a possible way of spontaneously broken symmetries is pointed out on the
level of canonical momentum.
