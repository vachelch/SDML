Is There Really a de Sitter/CFT Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper a de Sitter Space version of Black Hole Complementarity is
formulated which states that an observer in de Sitter Space describes the
surrounding space as a sealed finite temperature cavity bounded by a horizon
which allows no loss of information. We then discuss the implications of this
for the existence of boundary correlators in the hypothesized dS/cft
correspondence. We find that dS complementarity precludes the existence of the
appropriate limits. We find that the limits exist only in approximations in
which the entropy of the de Sitter Space is infinite. The reason that the
correlators exist in quantum field theory in the de Sitter Space background is
traced to the fact that horizon entropy is infinite in QFT.
