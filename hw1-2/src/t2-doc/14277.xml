Hawking radiation: a particle physics perspective
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently become fashionable to regard black holes as elementary
particles. By taking this suggestion seriously it is possible to cobble
together an elementary particle physics based estimate for the decay rate
$(\hbox{black hole})_i \to (\hbox{black hole})_f + (\hbox{massless quantum})$.
This estimate of the spontaneous emission rate contains two free parameters
which may be fixed by demanding that the high energy end of the spectrum of
emitted quanta match a blackbody spectrum at the Hawking temperature. The
calculation, though technically trivial, has important conceptual implications:
(1) The existence of Hawking radiation from black holes is ultimately dependent
only on the fact that massless quanta (and all other forms of matter) couple to
gravity. (2) The thermal nature of the Hawking spectrum depends only on the
fact that the number of internal states of a large mass black hole is enormous.
(3) Remarkably, the resulting formula for the decay rate gives meaningful
answers even when extrapolated to low mass black holes. The analysis strongly
supports the scenario of complete evaporation as the endpoint of the Hawking
radiation process (no naked singularity, no stable massive remnant).
