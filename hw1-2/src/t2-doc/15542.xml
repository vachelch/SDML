Greybody factor for the BTZ black hole and a 5D black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the 5D black holes in the type IIB superstring theory compactified
on $S^1 \times T^4$. Far from horizon, we have flat space-time. Near horizon,
we have $AdS_3(BTZ black hole) \times S^3 \times T^4$. We calculate the
greybody factor of a minimally coupled scalar by replacing the original
geometry($M_5 \times S^1 \times T^4$) by $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$. In the
low-energy scattering, it turns out that the result agrees with the greybody
factor of the 5D black hole (or D1 + D5 branes)in the dilute gas approximation.
This confirms that the $AdS$-theory($AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$) contains the
essential information about the bulk 5D black holes.
