Consistency in Regularizations of the Gauged NJL Model at One Loop Level
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we revisit questions recently raised in the literature
associated to relevant but divergent amplitudes in the gauged NJL model. The
questions raised involve ambiguities and symmetry violations which concern the
model's predictive power at one loop level. Our study shows by means of an
alternative prescription to handle divergent amplitudes, that it is possible to
obtain unambiguous and symmetry preserving amplitudes. The procedure adopted
makes use solely of {\it general} properties of an eventual regulator, thus
avoiding an explicit form. We find, after a thorough analysis of the problem
that there are well established conditions to be fulfiled by any consistent
regularization prescription in order to avoid the problems of concern at one
loop level.
