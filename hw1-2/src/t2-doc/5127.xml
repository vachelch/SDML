Kaplan-Narayanan-Neuberger lattice fermions pass a perturbative test
</title>

<abstract>
  We test perturbatively a recent scheme for implementing chiral fermions on
the lattice, proposed by Kaplan and modified by Narayanan and Neuberger, using
as our testing ground the chiral Schwinger model. The scheme is found to
reproduce the desired form of the effective action, whose real part is gauge
invariant and whose imaginary part gives the correct anomaly in the continuum
limit, once technical problems relating to the necessary infinite extent of the
extra dimension are properly addressed. The indications from this study are
that the Kaplan--Narayanan--Neuberger (KNN) scheme has a good chance at being a
correct lattice regularization of chiral gauge theories.
