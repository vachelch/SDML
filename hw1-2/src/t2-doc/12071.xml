The Exact Renormalization Group and Approximations
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the Exact Renormalization Group equations of Wegner and Houghton in
an approximation which permits both numerical and analytical studies of
nonperturbative renormalization flows. We obtain critical exponents numerically
and with the local polynomial approximation (LPA), and discuss the advantages
and shortcomings of these methods, and compare our results with the literature.
In particular, convergence of the LPA is discussed in some detail. We finally
integrate the flows numerically and find a $c$-function which determines these
flows to be gradient in this approximation.
