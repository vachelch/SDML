Chern-Simons Solitons, Toda Theories and the Chiral Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The two-dimensional self-dual Chern--Simons equations are equivalent to the
conditions for static, zero-energy solutions of the $(2+1)$-dimensional gauged
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with Chern--Simons matter-gauge dynamics. In
this paper we classify all finite charge $SU(N)$ solutions by first
transforming the self-dual Chern--Simons equations into the two-dimensional
chiral model (or harmonic map) equations, and then using the Uhlenbeck--Wood
classification of harmonic maps into the unitary groups. This construction also
leads to a new relationship between the $SU(N)$ Toda and $SU(N)$ chiral model
solutions.
