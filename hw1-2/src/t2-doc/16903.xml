On Correlation Functions for Non-critical Strings with c<1 but d>1
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a Goulian-Li-type continuation in the number of insertions of
the cosmological constant operator which is no longer restricted to one
dimensional target space. The method is applied to the calculation of the
three-point and a special four-point correlation function. Various aspects of
the emerging analytical structure are discussed.
