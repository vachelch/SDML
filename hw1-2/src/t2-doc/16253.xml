Spacetime Diffeomorphisms and Topological W-Infinity Symmetry in Two
  Dimensional Topological String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper analyzes spacetime symmetries of topological string theory on a
two dimensional torus, and points out that the spacetime geometry of the model
is that of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. Previously I found an infinite
symmetry algebra in the absolute BRST cohomology of the model. Here I find an
analog of the BV $\Delta$ operator, and show that it defines a natural
semirelative BRST cohomology. In the absolute cohomology, the ghost-number-zero
symmetries form the algebra of all infinitesimal spacetime diffeomorphisms,
extended at non-zero ghost numbers to the algebra of all odd-symplectic
diffeomorphisms on a spacetime supermanifold. In the semirelative cohomology,
the symmetries are reduced to $w_\infty$ at ghost number zero, and to a
topologically twisted N=2 $w_\infty$ superalgebra when all ghost numbers are
included. I discuss deformations of the model that break parts of the spacetime
symmetries while preserving the topological BRST symmetry on the worldsheet. In
the absolute cohomology of the deformed model, another topological $w_\infty$
superalgebra may emerge, while the semirelative cohomology leads to a bosonic
$w_\infty$ symmetry.
