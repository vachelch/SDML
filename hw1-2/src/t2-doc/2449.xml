Brane Transmutation in Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a family of BPS solutions of type IIA supergravity that can be
interpreted as describing the `transmutation' of a Neveu-Schwarz five-brane
into a D4-brane in the presence of a D6-brane. The D4-brane, which terminates
on the D6-brane, can be equally well interpreted as a `pure multipole'
configuration of NS5-brane wrapped tightly around the D6-brane. Such a
transmutation is a "near-core" version (i.e., near the D6-brane) of the
brane-creation that can occur when two branes pass through each other, as in
the Hanany-Witten construction. The work below highlights certain charge
non-conservation features of type IIA supergravity.
