Recombination of Intersecting D-branes by Local Tachyon Condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a simple low energy description of recombination of intersecting
D-branes using super Yang-Mills theory. The recombination is realized by
condensation of an off-diagonal tachyonic fluctuation localized at the
intersecting point. The recombination process is equivalent to brane-antibrane
annihilation, thus our result confirms Sen's conjecture on tachyon
condensation, although we work in the super Yang-Mills theory whose energy
scale is much lower than alpha'. We also discuss the decay width of
non-parallelly separated D-branes.
