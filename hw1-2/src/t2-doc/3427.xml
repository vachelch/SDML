On the perturbative corrections around D-string instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study ${\cal F}^4$-threshold corrections in an eight dimensional S-dual
pair of string theories, as a prototype of dual string vacua with sixteen
supercharges. We show that the orbifold CFT description of D-string instantons
gives rise to a perturbative expansion similar to the one appearing on the
fundamental string side. By an explicit calculation, using the Nambu-Goto
action in the static gauge, we show that the first subleading term agrees
precisely on the two sides. We then give a general argument to show that the
agreement extends to all orders.
