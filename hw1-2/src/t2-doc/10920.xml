Correction induced by irrelevant operators in the correlators of the 2d
  Ising model in a magnetic field

  We investigate the presence of irrelevant operators in the 2d Ising model
perturbed by a magnetic field, by studying the corrections induced by these
operators in the spin-spin correlator of the model. To this end we perform a
set of high precision simulations for the correlator both along the axes and
along the diagonal of the lattice. By comparing the numerical results with the
predictions of a perturbative expansion around the critical point we find
unambiguous evidences of the presence of such irrelevant operators. It turns
out that among the irrelevant operators the one which gives the largest
correction is the spin 4 operator T^2 + \bar T^2 which accounts for the
breaking of the rotational invariance due to the lattice. This result agrees
with what was already known for the correlator evaluated exactly at the
critical point and also with recent results obtained in the case of the thermal
perturbation of the model.
