Multiple Intersections of D-branes and M-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a classification of all multiple intersections of D-branes in ten
dimensions and M-branes in eleven dimensions that corresponds to threshold BPS
bound states. The residual supersymmetry of these composite branes is
determined. By dimensional reduction composite p-branes in lower dimensions can
be constructed. We emphasize in dimensions D greater or equal than two, those
solutions which involve a single scalar and depend on a single harmonic
function. For these extremal branes we obtain the strength of the coupling
between the scalar and the gauge field. In particular we give a D-brane and
M-brane interpretation of extreme p-branes in two, three and four dimensions.
