Mirage Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  A brane universe moving in a curved higher dimensional bulk space is
considered. The motion induces a cosmological evolution on the universe brane
that is indistiguishable from a similar one induced by matter density on the
brane. The phenomenological implications of such an idea are discussed. Various
mirage energy densities are found, corresponding to dilute matter driving the
cosmological expansion, many having superluminal properties $|w|>1$ or
violating the positive energy condition. It is shown that energy density due to
the world-volume fields is nicely incorporated into the picture. It is also
pointed out that the initial singularity problem is naturally resolved in this
context.
