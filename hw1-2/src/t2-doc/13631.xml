On the Three-Point Couplings in Toda Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Correlation functions of Toda field vertices are investigated by applying the
method of integrating zero-mode developed for Liouville theory. We generalize
the relations among the zero-, two- and three-point couplings known in
Liouville case to arbitrary Toda theories. Two- and three-point functions of
Toda vertices associated with the simple roots are obtained.
