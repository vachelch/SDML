Distributed Systems of Intersecting Branes at Arbitrary Angles
</title>

<abstract>
  A `reduced' action formulation for a general class of the supergravity
solutions, corresponding to the `marginally' bound `distributed' systems of
various types of branes at arbitrary angles, is developed. It turns out that
all the information regarding the classical features of such solutions is
encoded in a first order Lagrangian (the `reduced' Lagrangian) corresponding to
the desired geometry of branes. The marginal solution for a system of $N$ such
distributions (for various distribution functions) span an $N$ dimensional
submanifold of the fields' configuration (target) space, parametrised by a set
of $N$ independent harmonic functions on the transverse space. This
submanifold, which we call it as the `$H$-surface', is a null surface with
respect to a metric on the configuration space, which is defined by the reduced
Lagrangian. The equations of motion then transform to a set of equations
describing the embedding of a null geodesic surface in this space, which is
identified as the $H$-surface. Using these facts, we present a very simple
derivation of the conventional orthogonal solutions together with their
intersection rules. Then a new solution for a (distributed) pair of $p$-branes
at SU(2) angles in $D$ dimensions is derived.
