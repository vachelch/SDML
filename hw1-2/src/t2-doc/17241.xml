Dissipation of the String Embedding Dimension in the Singlet Sector of a
  Matrix Model at Large $\alpha^\prime$

  The one dimensional Fermi gas of matrix eigenvalues of the Marinari-Parisi
model at positive values of the cosmological constant is generalised.The number
of matrix eigenvalues (i.e. gas particles) is varied while keeping the
effective potential fixed. This model exhibits a transition from a phase whose
continuum behaviour is that of $c=1$ conformal matter coupled to gravity to the
well known pure gravity phase of the original model.The former phase is
character- ised by an extremely large Regge slope $\alpha^\prime$ which scales
as $\beta^{2/5}$ causing the scaling regions of the two phases to overlap. In
this way a continuous flow from one phase to the other is made poss- ible. This
phase transition occurs in the singlet sector of the matrix model. The density
of states and the two puncture correlator at non zero momenta are calculated on
the sphere and are found to behave very differ- ently in the two phases,a fact
which demonstrates the phase transition. We comment on a possible relation
between this transition and large \alpha^\prime$ semiclassical expansions in
the continuum.
