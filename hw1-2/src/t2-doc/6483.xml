Dashen's Phenomenon in Gauge Theories with Spontaneously Broken Chiral
  Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine Dashen's phenomenon in the Leutwyler--Smilga regime of QCD with
any number of colors and quarks in either the fundamental or adjoint
representations of the gauge group. In this limit, the theories only depend on
simple combinations of quark masses, volume, chiral condensate and vacuum
angle. Based upon this observation, we derive simple expressions for the chiral
condensate and the topological density and show that they are in fact related.
By examining the zeros of the various partition functions, we elucidate the
mechanism leading to Dashen's phenomena in QCD.
