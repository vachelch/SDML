AdS/CFT dualities involving large 2d N=4 superconformal symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the duality between string theory on AdS_3 X S^3 X S^3 and
two-dimensional conformal theories with large N=4 superconformal algebra
A_gamma. We discuss configurations of intersecting branes which give rise to
such near-horizon geometries. We compute the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and propose
that the boundary superconformal theory can be described by a sigma model on a
suitable symmetric product space with a particular choice of anti-symmetric
two-form.
