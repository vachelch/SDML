Supersymmetric Z_N times Z_M Orientifolds in 4D with D-Branes at Angles
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct orientifolds of type IIA string theory. The theory is
compactified on a T^6/Z_N times Z_M orbifold. In addition worldsheet parity in
combination with a reflection of three compact directions is modded out.
Tadpole cancellation requires to add D-6-branes at angles. The resulting four
dimensional theories are N=1 supersymmetric and non-chiral.
