Scalar field spacetimes and the AdS/CFT conjecture
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a class of asymptotically AdS scalar field spacetimes, and
calculate the associated conserved charges for three, four and five spacetime
dimensions using the conformal and counter-term prescriptions. The energy
associated with the solutions in each case is proportional to $\sqrt{M^2 -
k^2}$, where $M$ is a constant and $k$ is a scalar charge. In five spacetime
dimensions, the counter-term prescription gives an additional vacuum (Casimir)
energy, which agrees with that found in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.
We find a surprising degeneracy: the energy of the ``extremal'' scalar field
solution $M=k$ equals the energy of pure AdS. This result is discussed in light
of the AdS/CFT conjecture.
