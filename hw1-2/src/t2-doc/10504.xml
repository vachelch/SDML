Equivalent models for gauged WZW theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We modify the $SL(2,{\bf R})/U(1)$ WZW theory, which was shown to describe
strings in a 2D black hole, to be invariant under chiral $U(1)$ gauge symmetry
by introducing a Steukelberg field. We impose several interesting gauge
conditions for the chiral $U(1)$ symmetry. In a paticular gauge the theory is
found to be reduced to the Liouville theory coupled to the $c=1$ matter
perturbed by the so-called black hole mass operator. Also we discuss the
physical states in the models briefly.
