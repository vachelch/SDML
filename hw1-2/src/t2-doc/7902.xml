D branes in string theory, II

  In these lectures we review the properties of a boosted and rotated boundary
state and of a boundary state with an abelian gauge field deriving from it the
Dirac-Born-Infeld action and a newly constructed class of classical solutions.
We also review the construction of the boundary state for the stable non-BPS
state of type I theory corresponding to the perturbative state present at the
first excited level of the SO(32) heterotic string and transforming according
to the spinor representation of SO(32) (Lectures presented at the YITP Workshop
on ``Developments in Superstring and M-theory'', Kyoto, Japan, October 1999).
