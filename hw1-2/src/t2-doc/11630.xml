Classical and Quantum Wormholes in Einstein-Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Wormhole spacetimes may be responsible for the possible loss of quantum
coherence and the introduction of additional fundamental quantum indeterminancy
of the values of constants of nature. As a system which is known to admit such
classical wormhole solutions, Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) theory is revisited.
Since the classical wormhole instanton solution in this theory has been studied
extensively thus far, in the present work, ``quantum wormholes'' are explored.
Namely in the context of a minisuperspace quantum cosmology model based on this
EYM theory, ``quantum wormhole'', defined as a state represented by a solution
to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation satisfying an appropriate wormhole boundary
condition, is discussed. Finally, it is proposed that the minisuperspace model
based on this theory in the presence of the cosmological constant may serve as
a simple yet interesting system displaying an overall picture of entire
universe's history from the deep quantum domain all the way to the classical
domain.
