Duality of the Superstring in Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  The evolution of a closed NSR string is considered in the background of
constant graviton and antisymmetric fields. The $\sigma$-model action is
written in a manifestly supersymmetric form in terms of superfields. The first
order formalism adopted for the closed bosonic string is generalised to
implement duality transformations and the constant dual backgrounds are
obtained for the dual theory. We recover the $G \rightarrow G^{-1}$ duality for
the case when antisymmetric tensor field is set to zero. Next, the case when
the backgrounds depend on one superfield, is also analysed. This scenario is
similar to the cosmological case envisaged for the bosonic string. The explicit
form of the duality transformation is given for this case.
