Singularity and exit problems in two-dimensional string cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  A broad class of two-dimensional loop-corrected dilaton gravity models
exhibit cosmological solutions that interpolate between the string perturbative
vacuum and a background with asymptotically flat metric and linearly growing
dilaton. The curvature singularities of the corresponding tree-level solutions
are smoothed out, but no branch-change occurs. Thus, even in the presence of a
non-perturbative potential, the system is not attracted by physically
interesting fixed points with constant dilaton, and the exit problem of string
cosmology persists.
