Higher-Derivative Gravity and the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the AdS/CFT correspondence for higher-derivative gravity
systems, and develop a formalism in which the generating functional of the
boundary field theory is given as a functional that depends only on the
boundary values of bulk fields. We also derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-like equation
that uniquely determines the generating functional, and give an algorithm
calculating the Weyl anomaly. Using the expected duality between a
higher-derivative gravity system and N=2 superconformal field theory in four
dimensions, we demonstrate that the resulting Weyl anomaly is consistent with
the field theoretic one.
