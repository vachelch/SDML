Out of Equilibrium Relativistic Quantum Field Theory --- Perturbation
  Theory and Progress of Phase Transition
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper describes perturbative framework, on the basis of closed-time-path
formalism, for studying quasiuniform relativistic quantum field systems near
equilibrium and nonequilibrium quasistationary systems. At the first part,
starting from first principles, we construct perturbative schemes for
relativistic complex-scalar-field theory. We clarify what assumption is
involved in arriving at a standard perturbative framework and to what extent
the $n (\geq 4)$-point initial correlation functions that are usually discarded
in the standard framework can in fact be discarded. Two calculational schemes
are introduced, the one is formulated on the basis of the initial particle
distribution function and the one is formulated on the basis of the ``
physical'' particle distribution function. Both schemes are equivalent and lead
to a generalized relativistic kinetic or Boltzmann equation. At the second
part, using the perturbative loop-expansion scheme for an $O (N)$ linear
$\sigma$ model, we analyze how the chiral phase transition proceeds through
disoriented chiral condensates. The system of coupled equations that governs
the spacetime evolution of the condensate or order-parameter fields is derived.
The region where the curvature of the ``potential'' is negative is dealt with
by introducing the random-force fields. Application to simple situations is
made.
