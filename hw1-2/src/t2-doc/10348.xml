The Finiteness Requirement for Six-Dimensional Euclidean Einstein
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The finiteness requirement for Euclidean Einstein gravity is shown to be so
stringent that only the flat metric is allowed. We examine counterterms in 4D
and 6D Ricci-flat manifolds from general invariance arguments.
