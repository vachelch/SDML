Non-Critical String Models as Topological Coset models
</title>

<abstract>
  The topological coset model appraoch to non-critical string models is
summarized. The action of a topological twisted ${G\over H}$ coset model
($rank\ H = rank\ G$) is written down. A ``topological coset algebra" is
derived and compared with the algebraic structure of the $N=2$ twisted models.
  The cohomology on a free field Fock space as well as on the space of
irreducible representation of the ``matter" \ala are extracted. We compare the
results of the $A_1^{(N-1)}$ at level $k={p\over q}-N$ with those of $(p,q)$
$W_N$ strings. A ${SL(2,R)\over SL(2,R)}$ model which corresponds to the $c=1$
is written down. A similarity transformation on the BRST charge enables us to
extract the full BRST cohomoloy. One to one correspondence between the physical
states of the $c=1$ and the corresponding coset model is found. Talk presented
at ``Strings' 93", May 93 Berekely.}
