Relation Between Hyperelliptic Integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple property of the integrals over the hyperelliptic surfaces of
arbitrary genus is observed. Namely, the derivatives of these integrals with
respect to the branching points are given by the linear combination of the same
integrals. We check that this property is responsible for the solution to the
level zero Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation given in terms of hyperelliptic
integrals.
