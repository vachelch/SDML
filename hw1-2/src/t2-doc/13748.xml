Calculation of Expectation Values of S$_{z}$ and S$^{2}$ operators for
  spin-1 and spin-3/2 particles

<abstract>
  In the present article we calculate the expectation values of of S$_{z}$ and
S$^{2}$ operators for spin-1 and spin-3/2 particles by expanding a general wave
function which includes all spin values. The results are same as in the
stantard quantum mechanics.
