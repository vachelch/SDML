Constraint Supersymmetry Breaking and Non-Perturbative Effects in String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss supersymmetry breaking mechanism at the level of low energy N=1
effective superstring actions that exhibit $SL(2,Z)_T$ target space modular
duality or $SL(2,Z)_S$ strong-weak coupling duality. The allowed superpotential
forms use the assumption that the sourse of non-perturbative effects is not
specified and as a result represent the most general parametrization of
non-perturbative effects. We found that the allowed non-perturbative
superpotential is severely constrained when we use the cusp forms of the
modular group for its construction. By construction the poles of the
superpotential are either inside the fundamental domain or beyond. We also
found limits on the parameters of the superpotential by demanding that the
truncated potential for the gaugino condensate never breaks down at finite
values in the moduli space. The latter constitutes a criterion for avoiding
poles in the fundamental domain. However, the potential in most of the cases
avoids naturally singularities inside the fundamental domain, rendering the
potential finite. The minimum values of the limits on the parameters in the
superpotential may correspond to vacua with vanishing cosmological constant.
