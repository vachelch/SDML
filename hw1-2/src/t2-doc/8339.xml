Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangles, elementary couplings and fusion rules
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a general scheme for describing su(N)_k fusion rules in terms of
elementary couplings, using Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangles. A fusion coupling
is characterized by its corresponding tensor product coupling (i.e. its
Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangle) and the threshold level at which it first
appears. We show that a closed expression for this threshold level is encoded
in the Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangle and an explicit method to calculate it is
presented. In this way a complete solution of su(4)_k fusion rules is obtained.
