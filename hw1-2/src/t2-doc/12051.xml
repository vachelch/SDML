The One-Loop Five-Graviton Scattering Amplitude and Its Low-Energy Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  A covariant path integral calculation of the even spin structure contribution
to the one-loop N-graviton scattering amplitude in the type-II superstring
theory is presented. The apparent divergence of the $N=5$ amplitude is resolved
by separating it into twelve independent terms corresponding to different
orders of inserting the graviton vertex operators. Each term is well defined in
an appropriate kinematic region and can be analytically continued to physical
regions where it develops branch cuts required by unitarity. The zero-slope
limit of the $N=5$ amplitude is performed, and the Feynman diagram content of
the low-energy field theory is examined. Both one-particle irreducible (1PI)
and one-particle redicible (1PR) graphs with massless internal states are
generated in this limit. One set of 1PI graphs has the same divergent
dependence on the cut-off as that found in the four-graviton case, and it is
proved that such graphs exist for all~$N$. The 1PR graphs are contributed by
the poles in the world-sheet chiral Green functions.
