Gauge Independent Reduction of a Solvable Model with Gribov-Like
  Ambiguity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a gauge independent Lagrangian method of abstracting the reduced
space of a solvable model with Gribov-like ambiguity, recently proposed by
Friedberg, Lee, Pang and Ren. The reduced space is found to agree with the
explicit solutions obtained by these authors. Complications related to gauge
fixing are analysed. The Gribov ambiguity manifests by a nonuniqueness in the
canonical transformations mapping the hamiltonian in the afflicted gauge with
that obtained gauge independently. The operator ordering problem in this gauge
is investigated and a prescription is suggested so that the results coincide
with the usual hamiltonian formalism using the Schr\"odinger representation.
Finally, a Dirac analysis of the model is elaborated. In this treatment it is
shown how the existence of a nontrivial canonical set in the ambiguity-ridden
gauge yields the connection with the previous hamiltonian formalism.
