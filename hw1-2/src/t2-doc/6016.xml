Loop Integrals, R Functions and their Analytic Continuation
</title>

<abstract>
  To entirely determine the resulting functions of one-loop integrals it is
necessary to find the correct analytic continuation to all relevant kinematical
regions. We argue that this continuation procedure may be performed in a
general and mathematical accurate way by using the ${\cal R}$ function notation
of these integrals. The two- and three-point cases are discussed explicitly in
this manner.
