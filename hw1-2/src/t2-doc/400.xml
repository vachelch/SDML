Stable non-BPS D-branes in Type I string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the boundary state formalism to study, from the closed string point of
view, superpositions of branes and anti-branes which are relevant in some
non-perturbative string dualities. Treating the tachyon instability of these
systems as proposed by A. Sen, we show how to incorporate the effects of the
tachyon condensation directly in the boundary state. In this way we manage to
show explicitly that the D1 -- anti-D1 pair of Type I is a stable non-BPS
D-particle, and compute its mass. We also generalize this construction to
describe other non-BPS D-branes of Type I. By requiring the absence of tachyons
in the open string spectrum, we find which configurations are stable and
compute their tensions. Our classification is in complete agreement with the
results recently obtained using the K-theory of space-time.
