M-Fivebrane from the Open Supermembrane
</title>

<abstract>
  Covariant field equations of M-fivebrane in eleven dimensional curved
superspace are obtained from the requirement of kappa-symmetry of an open
supermembrane ending on a fivebrane. The worldvolume of the latter is a (6|16)
dimensional supermanifold embedded in the (11|32) dimensional target
superspace. The kappa-symmetry of the system imposes a constraint on this
embedding, and a constraint on a modified super 3-form field strength on the
fivebrane worldvolume. These constraints govern the dynamics of the
M-fivebrane.
