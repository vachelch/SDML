Orientifolds with branes at angles
</title>

<abstract>
  We present supersymmetry breaking four dimensional orientifolds of type IIA
strings. The compact space is a torus times a four dimensional orbifold. The
orientifold group reflects one direction in each torus. RR tadpoles are
cancelled by D6-branes intersecting at angles in the torus and in the orbifold.
The angles are chosen such that supersymmetry is broken. The resulting four
dimensional theories contain chiral fermions. The tadpole cancellation
conditions imply that there are no non-abelian gauge anomalies. The models also
contain anomaly-free U(1) factors.
