Equivalence of Geometric Engineering and Hanany-Witten via Fractional
  Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an explicit relation between the Hanany-Witten and Geometric
Engineering approaches of realising gauge theories in string theory. The last
piece in the puzzle is a T-duality relating arbitrary Hanany-Witten setups and
fractional branes.
