Discrete Spectra of Charged Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Bekenstein proposed that the spectrum of horizon area of quantized black
holes must be discrete and uniformly spaced. We examine this proposal in the
context of spherically symmetric charged black holes in a general class of
gravity theories. By imposing suitable boundary conditions on the reduced phase
space of the theory to incorporate the thermodynamic properties of these black
holes and then performing a simplifying canonical transformation, we are able
to quantize the system exactly. The resulting spectra of horizon area, as well
as that of charge are indeed discrete. Within this quantization scheme,
near-extremal black holes (of any mass) turn out to be highly quantum objects,
whereas extremal black holes do not appear in the spectrum, a result that is
consistent with the postulated third law of black hole thermodynamics.
