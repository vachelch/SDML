Hamiltonian Approach to Lagrangian Gauge Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the problem of finding all local symmetries of a Lagrangian.
Our approach is completely Hamiltonian without any reference to the associated
action. We present a simple algorithm for obtaining the restrictions on the
gauge parameters entering in the definition of the generator of gauge
transformations.
