A Statistical Interpretation of Space and Classical-Quantum duality
</title>

<abstract>
  By defining a prepotential function for the stationary Schr\"odinger equation
we derive an inversion formula for the space variable $x$ as a function of the
wave-function $\psi$. The resulting equation is a Legendre transform that
relates $x$, the prepotential ${\cal F}$, and the probability density. We
invert the Schr\"odinger equation to a third-order differential equation for
${\cal F}$ and observe that the inversion procedure implies a $x$-$\psi$
duality. This phenomenon is related to a modular symmetry due to the
superposition of the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We propose that
in quantum mechanics the space coordinate can be interpreted as a macroscopic
variable of a statistical system with $\hbar$ playing the role of a scaling
parameter. We show that the scaling property of the space coordinate with
respect to $\tau=\partial_{\psi}^2{\cal F}$ is determined by the
``beta-function''. We propose that the quantization of the inversion formula
is a natural way to quantize geometry. The formalism is extended to higher
dimensions and to the Klein-Gordon equation.
