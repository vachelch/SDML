Hilbert Space of Space-time SCFT in AdS_3 Supersting and T^{4kp}/S_{kp}
  SCFT

<abstract>
  We explore the superstring theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4 in the framework given
in hep-th/9806194. We argue on the Hilbert space of "space-time CFT", and
especially construct a suitable vacuum of this CFT from the physical degrees of
freedom of the superstring theory in bulk. We first construct it explicitly in
the case of p=1, and then present a proposal for the general cases of p>1.
  After giving some completion of the GKS's constructions of the higher mode
operators (in particular, of those including spin fields), we also make some
comparison between the space-time CFT and T^{4kp}/S_{kp} SCFT, namely, with
respect to the physical spectrum of chiral primaries and some algebraic
structures of bosonic and fermionic oscillators in both theories. We also
observe how our proposal about the Hilbert space of space-time CFT leads to a
satisfactory correspondence between the spectrum of chiral primaries of both
theories in the cases of p>1.
