On Equivalence of Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau and Klein-Gordon Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  A strict proof of equivalence between Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) and
Klein-Gordon (KG) theories is presented for physical S-matrix elements in the
case of charged scalar particles interacting in minimal way with an external or
quantized electromagnetic field. First, Hamiltonian canonical approach to DKP
theory is developed in both component and matrix form. The theory is then
quantized through the construction of the generating functional for Green
functions (GF) and the physical matrix elements of S-matrix are proved to be
relativistic invariants. The equivalence between both theories is then proved
using the connection between GF and the elements of S-matrix, including the
case of only many photons states, and for more general conditions - so called
reduction formulas of Lehmann, Symanzik, Zimmermann.
