Field theory of the spinning electron: Internal motions
</title>

<abstract>
  We present here a field theory of the spinning electron, by writing down a
new equation for the 4-velocity field v^mu (different from that of Dirac
theory), which allows a classically intelligible description of the electron.
Moreover, we make explicit the noticeable kinematical properties of such
velocity field (which also result different from the ordinary ones). At last,
we analyze the internal zitterbewegung (zbw) motions, for both time-like and
light-like speeds. We adopt in this paper the ordinary tensorial language. Our
starting point is the Barut-Zanghi classical theory for the relativistic
electron, which related spin with zbw. This paper is dedicated to the memory of
Asim O. Barut, who so much contributed to clarifying very many fundamental
issues of physics, and whose work constitutes a starting point of these
articles.
