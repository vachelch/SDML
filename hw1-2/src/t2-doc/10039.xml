The O(N) vector model in the large N limit revisited: multicritical
  points and double scaling limit
</title>

<abstract>
  The multicritical points of the $O(N)$ invariant $N$ vector model in the
large $N$ limit are reexamined. Of particular interest are the subtleties
involved in the stability of the phase structure at critical dimensions. In the
limit $N \to \infty$ while the coupling $g \to g_c$ in a correlated manner (the
double scaling limit) a massless bound state $O(N)$ singlet is formed and
powers of $1/N$ are compensated by IR singularities. The persistence of the $N
\to \infty$ results beyond the leading order is then studied with particular
interest in the possible existence of a phase with propagating small mass
vector fields and a massless singlet bound state. We point out that under
certain conditions the double scaled theory of the singlet field is
non-interacting in critical dimensions.
