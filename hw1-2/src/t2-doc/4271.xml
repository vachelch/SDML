Gaugino Condensation in the Chiral and Linear Representation of the
  Dilaton
</title>

<abstract>
  String effective theories with N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions are
subject of the discussion. Gaugino condensation in the chiral representation of
the dilaton is reviewed in the truncated formalism in the
$U_{K}(1)$-superspace. Using the supersymmetric duality of the dilaton the same
investigation is made in the linear representation of the dilaton. We show that
for the simple case of one gaugino condensate the results concerning
supersymmtry breaking are independent of the representation of the dilaton.
