Explicit Zeta Functions for Bosonic and Fermionic Fields on a
  Noncommutative Toroidal Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  Explicit formulas for the zeta functions $\zeta_\alpha (s)$ corresponding to
bosonic ($\alpha =2$) and to fermionic ($\alpha =3$) quantum fields living on a
noncommutative, partially toroidal spacetime are derived. Formulas for the most
general case of the zeta function associated to a quadratic+linear+constant
form (in {\bf Z}) are obtained. They provide the analytical continuation of the
zeta functions in question to the whole complex $s-$plane, in terms of series
of Bessel functions (of fast, exponential convergence), thus being extended
Chowla-Selberg formulas. As well known, this is the most convenient expression
that can be found for the analytical continuation of a zeta function, in
particular, the residua of the poles and their finite parts are explicitly
given there. An important novelty is the fact that simple poles show up at
$s=0$, as well as in other places (simple or double, depending on the number of
compactified, noncompactified, and noncommutative dimensions of the spacetime),
where they had never appeared before. This poses a challenge to the
zeta-function regularization procedure.
