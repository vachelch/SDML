Liouville Models of Black Hole Evaporation

<abstract>
  We construct new theories of dilation gravity coupled to conformal matter
which are exact $c=26$ conformal field theories and presumably consistent
frameworks for discussing black hole physics in two dimensions. They differ
from the CGHS equations in the precise dilaton dependence of the cosmological
constant. A further modification proposed by Strominger with a view to
eliminating unphysical ghost Hawking radiation is also considered. The new
classical equations of motion are explicitly soluble, thus permitting an exact
analysis of both static and dynamic senarios. While the static solutions are
physically reasonable, the dynamical solutions include puzzling examples with
wrong-sign Hawking radiation. We indicate how the latter problem may be
resolved in the full quantum theory.
