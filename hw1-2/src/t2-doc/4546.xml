On structure of effective action in four-dimensional quantum dilaton
  supergravity

<abstract>
  A general structure of effective action in new chiral superfield model
associated with $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity is investigated. This model
corresponds to finite quantum field theory and does not demand the
regularization and renormalization at effective action calculation. It is shown
that in local approximation the effective action is defined by two objects
called general superfield effective lagrangian and chiral superfield effective
lagrangian. A proper-time method is generalized for calculation of these two
effective lagrangians in superfield manner. Power expansion of the effective
action in supercovariant derivatives is formulated and the lower terms of such
an expansion are calculated in explicit superfield form.
