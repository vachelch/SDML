Stable Solutions of the Double Compactified D=11 Supermembrane Dual
</title>

<abstract>
  The hamiltonian formulation of the supersymmetric closed 2-brane dual to the
double compactified D=11 closed supermembrane is presented. The formulation is
in terms of two U(1) vector fields related by the area preserving constraint of
the SUSY 2-brane. Stable solutions of the field equations, which are local
minima of the hamiltonian, are found. In the semiclassical approximation around
the stable solutions the action becomes the reduction of D=10 Super-Maxwell to
the worldvolume. The solutions carry RR charges as a type of magnetic charges
associated with the worldvolume vector field. The geometrical interpretation of
the solution in terms of U(1) line bundles over the worldvolume is obtained.
