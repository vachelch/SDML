A Soluble Theory of Massless Scalar QED_2
</title>

<abstract>
  In this brief report, we analyze a generalized theory of massless scalar
QED_2 and show that, unlike the conventional scalar QED_2, it is free from
infrared divergence problems. The model is exactly soluble and may describe, in
an 1+1 dimensional space-time, noninteracting spin-one tachyons.
