Batalin-Tyutin Quantization of the (2+1) dimensional nonabelian
  Chern-Simons field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The (2+1) dimensional nonabelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to complex
scalar fields is quantized by using the Batalin-Tyutin canonical Hamiltonian
method which systematically embeds second-class constraint system into
first-class one. We obtain the gauge-invariant nonabelian Wess-Zumino type
action in the extended phase space.
