Light-Cone Wilson Loops and the String/Gauge Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate a \Pi-shape Wilson loop in N=4 super Yang--Mills theory, which
lies partially at the light-cone, and consider an associated open superstring
in AdS_5 x S^5. We discuss how this Wilson loop determines the anomalous
dimensions of conformal operators with large Lorentz spin and present an
explicit calculation in perturbation theory to order \lambda. We find the
minimal surface in the supergravity approximation, that reproduces the Gubser,
Klebanov and Polyakov prediction for the anomalous dimensions at large
\lambda=g_YM^2 N, and discuss its quantum-mechanical interpretation.
