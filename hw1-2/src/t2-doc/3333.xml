Particle-Vortex Duality and the Modular Group: Applications to the
  Quantum Hall Effect and Other 2-D Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how particle-vortex duality implies the existence of a large
non-abelian discrete symmetry group which relates the electromagnetic response
for dual two-dimensional systems in a magnetic field. For conductors with
charge carriers satisfying Fermi statistics (or those related to fermions by
the action of the group), the resulting group is known to imply many, if not
all, of the remarkable features of Quantum Hall systems. For conductors with
boson charge carriers (modulo group transformations) a different group is
predicted, implying equally striking implications for the conductivities of
these systems, including a super-universality of the critical exponents for
conductor/insulator and superconductor/insulator transitions in two dimensions
and a hierarchical structure, analogous to that of the quantum Hall effect but
different in its details. Our derivation shows how this symmetry emerges at low
energies, depending only weakly on the details of dynamics of the underlying
systems.
