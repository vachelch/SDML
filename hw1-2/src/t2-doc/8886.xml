Radiation Damping of a BPS Monopole; an Implication to S-duality
</title>

<abstract>
  The radiation reaction of a BPS monopole in the presence of incident
electromagnetic waves as well as massless Higgs waves is analyzed classically.
The reactive forces are compared to those of $W$ boson that is interpreted as a
dual partner of the BPS monopole. It is shown that the damping of acceleration
is dual to each other, while in the case of finite size effects the duality is
broken explicitly. Their implications on the duality are discussed.
