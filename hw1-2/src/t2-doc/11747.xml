TQFT versus RCFT: 3-d topological invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  A straightforward relationship between the two approaches to 3-dimensional
topological invariants, one of them put forward by Witten in the framework of
topological quantum field theory, and the second one proposed by Kohno in terms
of rational conformal field theory, is established.
