Chern-Simons Particles with Nonstandard Gravitational Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  The model of nonrelativistic particles coupled to nonstandard (2+1)-gravity
[1] is extended to include Abelian or non-Abelian charges coupled to
Chern-Simons gauge fields. Equivalently, the model may be viewed as describing
the (Abelian or non-Abelian) anyonic dynamics of Chern-Simons particles
coupled, in a reparametrization invariant way, to a translational Chern-Simons
action. The quantum two-body problem is described by a nonstandard
Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a noninteger angular momentum depending on energy
as well as particle charges. Some numerical results describing the modification
of the energy levels by these charges in the confined regime are presented. The
modification involves a shift as well as splitting of the levels.
