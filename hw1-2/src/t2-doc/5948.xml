Stable Non-BPS Membranes on M(atrix) Orientifold
</title>

<abstract>
  Examples of stable, non-BPS M-theory membrane configuration are constructed
via M(atrix) theory. The stable membranes are localized on O4 or O8
orientifolds, which projects Chan-Paton gauge bundle of M(atrix) zero-brane
partons to USp-type. The examples are shown to be consistent with prediction
based on K-theory analysis.
