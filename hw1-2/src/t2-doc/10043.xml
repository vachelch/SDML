Integrable Systems for Particles with Internal Degrees of Freedom
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a class of models for particles with internal degrees of freedom
are integrable. These systems are basically generalizations of the models of
Calogero and Sutherland. The proofs of integrability are based on a recently
developed exchange operator formalism. We calculate the wave-functions for the
Calogero-like models and find the ground-state wave-function for a
Calogero-like model in a position dependent magnetic field. This last model
might have some relevance for matrix models of open strings.
