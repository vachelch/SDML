Tachyon Condensates, Carrollian Contraction of Lorentz Group, and
  Fundamental Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the rolling tachyon condensate in the presence of a gauge field. The
generic vacuum admits both a rolling tachyon, \dot{T}, and a uniform electric
field, \vec{E}, which together affect the effective metric governing the
fluctuations of open string modes. If one suppresses the gauge field
altogether, the light-cone collapses completely. This is the Carrollian limit,
with vanishing speed of light and no possible propagation of signals. In the
presence of a gauge field, however, the lightcone is squeezed to the shape of a
fan, allowing propagation of signals along the direction of \pm \vec{E} at
speed |E|=<1. This shows that there are perturbative degrees of freedom
propagating along electric flux lines. Such causal behavior appears to be a
very general feature of tachyon effective Lagrangian with runway potentials. We
speculate on how this may be connected to appearance of fundamental strings.
