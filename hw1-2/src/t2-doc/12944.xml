Universalty and Ultraviolet Regularizations of Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The universality of radiative corrections to the gauge coupling constant $k$
of Chern-Simons theory is studied in a very general regularization scheme. We
show that the effective coupling constant $k$ induced by radiative corrections
depends crucially on the balance between the ultraviolet behavior of scalar and
pseudoscalar terms in the regularized action. There are three different
regimes. When the ultraviolet leading term is scalar the coupling $k$ is
shifted to $k+h^{\vee}$.However, if the leading term is pseudoscalar the shift
is $k+s h^{\vee}$ with $s=0$ or $s=2$ depending on the sign of such a term. In
the borderline case when the scalar and pseudoscalar terms have the same
ultraviolet behavior the shift of $k$ becomes arbitrary (even non-integer) and
depends on the parameters of the regularization. We also show that the
coefficient of the induced gravitational Chern-Simons term is different for the
three regimes and has the same universality properties than the effective
coupling constant $k$. The results open the possibility of a connection with
non-rational two-dimensional conformal theories in the borderline regime.
