Kantowski-Sachs String Cosmologies
</title>

<abstract>
  We present new exact solutions of the low-energy-effective-action string
equations with both dilaton $\phi $ and axion $H$ fields non-zero. The
background universe is of Kantowski-Sachs type. We consider the possibility of
a pseudoscalar axion field $h$ ($H=e^\phi (dh)^{*}$) that can be either time or
space dependent. The case of time-dependent $h$ reduces to that of a stiff
perfect-fluid cosmology. For space-dependent $h$ there is just one non-zero
time-space-space component of the axion field $H$, and this corresponds to a
distinguished direction in space which prevents the models from isotropising.
Also, in the latter case, both the axion field $H$ and its tensor potential $B$
($H=dB$) are dependent on time and space yet the energy-momentum tensor remains
time-dependent as required by the homogeneity of the cosmological model.
