Spin Foam Models of Matter Coupled to Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a class of spin foam models describing matter coupled to
gravity, such that the gravitational sector is described by the unitary
irreducible representations of the appropriate symmetry group, while the matter
sector is described by the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of
that group. The corresponding spin foam amplitudes in the four-dimensional
gravity case are expressed in terms of the spin network amplitudes for
pentagrams with additional external and internal matter edges. We also give a
quantum field theory formulation of the model, where the matter degrees of
freedom are described by spin network fields carrying the indices from the
appropriate group representation. In the non-topological Lorentzian gravity
case, we argue that the matter representations should be appropriate SO(3) or
SO(2) representations contained in a given Lorentz matter representation,
depending on whether one wants to describe a massive or a massless matter
field. The corresponding spin network amplitudes are given as multiple
integrals of propagators which are matrix spherical functions.
