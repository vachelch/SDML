Pair Production of charged vector bosons in supercritical magnetic
  fields at finite temperatures
</title>

<abstract>
  The thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas of charged vector bosons (with
mass m and charge e) is studied in a strong external homogeneous magnetic field
no greater than the critical value B_{cr}=m^2/e. The thermodynamic potential,
after appropriate analytic continuation, is then used in the study of the
spontaneous production of charged spin-one boson pairs from vacuum in the
presence of a supercritical homogeneous magnetic field at finite temperature.
