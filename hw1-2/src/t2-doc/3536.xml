One Instanton Predictions of a Seiberg-Witten curve from M-theory: the
  Symmetric Representation of SU(N)
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in four dimensions with
gauge group SU(N) for N larger than two. Using the cubic curve for a matter
hypermultiplet transforming in the symmetric representation, obtained from
M-theory by Landsteiner and Lopez, we calculate the prepotential up to the one
instanton correction. We treat the curve to be approximately hyperelliptic and
perform a perturbation expansion for the Seiberg-Witten differential to get the
one instanton contribution. We find that it reproduces the correct result for
one-loop, and we obtain the prediction for that curve for the one instanton
correction term.
