Brane Rotating Symmetries and the Fivebrane Equations of Motion
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the fully covariant equations of motion for the M-theory
fivebrane can be interpreted as charge conservation equations. The associated
charges induce `shift'-symmetries of the scalar, spinor and gauge-fields of the
fivebrane, so allowing an interpretation of all these fields as Goldstone
fields. We also find that the fivebrane possesses a new symmetry that is part
of the GL(32) automorphism group of the eleven dimensional supersymmetry
algebra.
