Instanton Effects in Matrix Models and String Effective Lagrangians
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform an explicit calculation of the lowest order effects of single
eigenvalue instantons on the continuous sector of the collective field theory
derived from a $d=1$ bosonic matrix model. These effects consist of certain
induced operators whose exact form we exhibit.
