AdS Dual of the Critical O(N) Vector Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a general relation between theories of infinite number of
higher-spin massless gauge fields in $AdS_{d+1}$ and large $N$ conformal
theories in $d$ dimensions containing $N$-component vector fields. In
particular, we propose that the singlet sector of the well-known critical 3-d
O(N) model with the $(\phi^a \phi^a)^2$ interaction is dual, in the large $N$
limit, to the minimal bosonic theory in $AdS_4$ containing massless gauge
fields of even spin.
