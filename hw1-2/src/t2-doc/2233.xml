Large and small Density Approximations to the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide analytical solutions to the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations
in the large and small density approximations. We extend results previously
obtained for leading order behaviour of the scaling function of affine Toda
field theories related to simply laced Lie algebras to the non-simply laced
case. The comparison with semi-classical methods shows perfect agreement for
the simply laced case. We derive the Y-systems for affine Toda field theories
with real coupling constant and employ them to improve the large density
approximations. We test the quality of our analysis explicitly for the
Sinh-Gordon model and the $(G_2^{(1)},D_4^{(3)})$-affine Toda field theory.
