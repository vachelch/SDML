Localized Gravitons, Gauge Bosons and Chiral Fermions in Smooth Spaces
  Generated by a Bounce
</title>

<abstract>
  We study five-dimensional solutions to Einstein equations coupled to a scalar
field. Bounce-type solutions for the scalar field are associated with AdS_5
spaces with smooth warp functions. Gravitons are dynamically localized in this
framework in analogy to the Randall-Sundrum solution whereas, a bulk fermion
gives rise to a single chiral zero mode localized at the bounce. Additional
bulk scalar fields are incorporated in this picture. The dilaton, as a bulk
scalar leads, through its coupling, to localized gauge boson fields, something
that holds also in the case that the bounce system is replaced by a brane.
