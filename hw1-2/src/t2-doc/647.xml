Worldvolume Uncertainty Relations for D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  By quantizing an open string ending on a D-brane in a nontrivial supergravity
background, we argue that there is a new kind of uncertainty relation on a
D-brane worldvolume. Furthermore, we fix the form of the uncertainty relations
and their dependence on the string coupling constant by requiring them to be
consistent with various string theory and M theory dualities. In this way we
find a web of uncertainties of spacetime for all kinds of brane probes,
including fundamental strings, D-branes of all dimensions as well as M theory
membranes and fivebranes.
