Matter Fields in the Lagrangian Loop Representation: Scalar QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the extension of the Lagrangian loop gauge invariant
representation in such a way to include matter fields. The partition function
of lattice compact U(1)-Higgs model is expressed as a sum over closed as much
as open surfaces. We have simulated numerically the loop action equivalent to
the Villain form of the action and mapped out the beta-gamma phase diagram of
this model.
