Free q-Schrodinger Equation from Homogeneous Spaces of the 2-dim
  Euclidean Quantum Group

<abstract>
  After a preliminary review of the definition and the general properties of
the homogeneous spaces of quantum groups, the quantum hyperboloid qH and the
quantum plane qP are determined as homogeneous spaces of Fq(E(2)). The
canonical action of Eq(2) is used to define a natural q-analog of the free
Schro"dinger equation, that is studied in the momentum and angular momentum
bases. In the first case the eigenfunctions are factorized in terms of products
of two q-exponentials. In the second case we determine the eigenstates of the
unitary representation, which, in the qP case, are given in terms of Hahn-Exton
functions. Introducing the universal T-matrix for Eq(2) we prove that the
Hahn-Exton as well as Jackson q-Bessel functions are also obtained as matrix
elements of T, thus giving the correct extension to quantum groups of well
known methods in harmonic analysis.
