Two Dimensional Gauge Theoretic Supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate two dimensional supergravity theories, which can be built from
a topological and gauge invariant action defined on an ordinary surface. We
concentrate on four models. The first model is the $N=1$ supersymmetric
extension of Jackiw-Teiltelboim model presented by Chamseddine in a superspace
formalism. We complement the proof of Montano, Aoaki, and Sonnenschein that
this extension is topological and gauge invariant, based on the graded de
Sitter algebra. Not only do the equation of motions correspond to the
supergravity ones and gauge transformations encompass local supersymmetries,
but also we identify the $\int \langle \eta, F\rangle$-theory with the
superfield formalism action written by Chamseddine. Next, we show that the
$N=1$ supersymmetric extension of string inspired two dimensional dilaton
gravity put forward by Park and Strominger is a theory that satisfies a
non-vanishing curvature condition and cannot be written as a $\int\langle
\eta,F\rangle$-theory. As an alternative, we propose two examples of
topological and gauge invariant theories that are based on graded extension of
the extended Poincar\'e algebra and satisfy a vanishing curvature condition.
Both models are interpreted as supersymmetric extensions of the string inspired
dilaton gravity.
