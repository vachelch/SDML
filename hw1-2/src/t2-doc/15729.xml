A Twistor Formulation of the Non-Heterotic Superstring with Manifest
  Worldsheet Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new formulation of the $D=3$ type II superstring which is
manifestly invariant under both target-space $N=2$ supersymmetry and worldsheet
$N=(1,1)$ super reparametrizations. This gives rise to a set of twistor
(commuting spinor) variables, which provide a solution to the two Virasoro
constraints. The worldsheet supergravity fields are shown to play the r\^ole of
auxiliary fields.
