A twistor formulation of the heterotic D=10 superstring with manifest
  (8,0) worldsheet supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new formulation of the heterotic $D=10$ Green-Schwarz
superstring whose worldsheet is a superspace with two even and eight odd
coordinates. The action is manifestly invariant under both target-space
supersymmetry and a worldsheet reparametrisation supergroup. It contains only a
finite set of auxiliary fields. The key ingredient are the commuting spinor
(twistor) variables, which naturally arise as worldsheet superpartners of the
target space Grassmann coordinates. These spinors parametrise the sphere $S^8$
regarded as a coset space of the $D=10$ Lorentz group. The sphere is associated
with the lightlike vector of one of the string Virasoro constraints. The origin
of the on-shell $D=10$ fermionic kappa symmetry of the standard Green-Schwarz
formulation is explained. An essential and unusual feature is the appearance of
the string tension only on shell as an integration constant.
