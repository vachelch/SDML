Dual Waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the gravitational waves in the 10-dimensional target space of the
superstring theory. Some of these waves have unbroken supersymmetries. They
consist of Brinkmann metric and of a 2-form field. Sigma-model duality is
applied to such waves. The corresponding solutions we call dual partners of
gravitational waves, or dual waves. Some of these dual waves upon Kaluza-Klein
dimensional reduction to 4 dimensions become equivalent to the
conformo-stationary solutions of axion-dilaton gravity. Such solutions include
dilaton extreme black holes, axion-dilaton Israel-Werner-Perjes-type spacetimes
and extreme charged axion-dilaton Taub-Nut solutions. The unbroken
supersymmetry of the gravitational waves transfers to the unbroken
supersymmetry of axion-dilaton IWP solutions. More general supersymmetric
4-dimensional configurations derivable from 10-dimensional waves are described.
