On Non Commutative Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the algebraic geometry method of Berenstein et al (hep-th/0005087), we
reconsider the derivation of the non commutative quintic algebra
${\mathcal{A}}_{nc}(5)$ and derive new representations by choosing different
sets of Calabi-Yau charges ${C_{i}^{a}}$. Next we extend these results to
higher $d$ complex dimension non commutative Calabi-Yau hypersurface algebras
${\mathcal{A}}_{nc}(d+2)$. We derive and solve the set of constraint eqs
carrying the non commutative structure in terms of Calabi-Yau charges and
discrete torsion. Finally we construct the representations of
${\mathcal{A}}_{nc}(d+2) $ preserving manifestly the Calabi-Yau condition $
\sum_{i}C_{i}^{a}=0$ and give comments on the non commutative subalgebras.
