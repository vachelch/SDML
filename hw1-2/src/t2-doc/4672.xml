(Weak) G_2 Holonomy from Self-duality, Flux and Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a simple and pedagogical
discussion of how compactifications of M-theory or supergravity preserving some
four-dimensional supersymmetry naturally lead to reduced holonomy or its
generalization, reduced weak holonomy. We relate the existence of a (conformal)
Killing spinor to the existence of certain closed and co-closed p-forms, and to
the metric being Ricci flat or Einstein. Then, for seven-dimensional manifolds,
we show that octonionic self-duality conditions on the spin connection are
equivalent to G_2 holonomy and certain generalized self-duality conditions to
weak G_2 holonomy. The latter lift to self-duality conditions for
cohomogeneity-one spin(7) metrics. To illustrate the power of this approach, we
present several examples where the self-duality condition largely simplifies
the derivation of a G_2 or weak G_2 metric.
