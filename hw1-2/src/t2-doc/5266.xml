Marginal and Scalar Solutions in Cubic Open String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We find marginal and scalar solutions in cubic open string field theory by
using left-right splitting properties of a delta function. The marginal
solution represents a marginal deformation generated by a U(1) current, and it
is a generalized solution of the Wilson lines one given by the present authors.
The scalar solution has a well-defined universal Fock space expression, and it
is expressed as a singular gauge transform of the trivial vacuum. The expanded
theory around it is unable to be connected with the original theory by the
string field redefinition. Errors in hep-th/0112124 are corrected in this
paper.
