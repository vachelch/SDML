N=1 supersymmetric path-integral Poisson-Lie duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the path-integral formulation of Poisson-Lie duality found by
Tyurin and von Unge to N=1 supersymmetric sigma-models. Using an explicit
representation of the generators of the Drinfel'd double corresponding to
GxU(1)^dimG we discuss an application to non-abelian duality. The paper also
contains the relevant background and some comments on Poisson-Lie duality.
