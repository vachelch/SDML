Dynamics and integrability property of the chiral string model
</title>

<abstract>
  The effect of fermionic string conductivity by purely right (or purely left)
moving ``zero modes'' is shown to be governed by a simple Lagrangian
characterising a certain ``chiral'' (null current carrying) string model whose
dynamical equations of motion turn out to be explicitly integrable in a flat
spacetime background.
