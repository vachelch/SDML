Hamiltonization of theories with degenerate coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a class of Lagrangian theories where part of the coordinates does
not have any time derivatives in the Lagrange function (we call such
coordinates degenerate). We advocate that it is reasonable to reconsider the
conventional definition of singularity based on the usual Hessian and,
moreover, to simplify the conventional Hamiltonization procedure. In
particular, in such a procedure, it is not necessary to complete the degenerate
coordinates with the corresponding conjugate momenta.
