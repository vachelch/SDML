A Note on Einstein Gravity on AdS$_3$ and Boundary Conformal Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We find a simple relation between the first subleading terms in the
asymptotic expansion of the metric field in AdS$_3$, obeying the Brown-Henneaux
boundary conditions, and the stress tensor of the underlying Liouville theory
on the boundary. We can also provide an more explicit relation between the bulk
metric and the boundary conformal field theory when it is described in terms of
a free field with a background charge.
