D-brane charge, flux quantisation and relative (co)homology
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the problem of U(1) flux and D0-charge for D-branes in the WZW
model and investigate the relationship between the different definitions that
have been proposed recently. We identify the D0-charge as a particular
reduction of a class in the relative cohomology of the group modulo the
D-submanifold. We investigate under which conditions this class is equivalent
to the first Chern class of a line bundle on the D-submanifold and we find that
in general there is an obstruction given by the cohomology class of the NS
3-form. Therefore we conclude that for topologically nontrivial B-fields, there
is strictly speaking no U(1) gauge field on the D-submanifold. Nevertheless the
ambiguity in the flux is not detected by the D0-charge. This has a natural
interpretation in terms of gerbes.
