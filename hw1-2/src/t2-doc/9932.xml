Critical thermodynamics of the two-dimensional systems in five-loop
  renormalization-group approximation

<abstract>
  The RG functions of the 2D n-vector \phi^4 model are calculated in the
five-loop approximation. Perturbative series for the \beta-function and
critical exponents are resummed by the Pade-Borel and Pade-Borel-Leroy
techniques, resummation procedures are optimized and an accuracy of the
numerical results is estimated. In the Ising case n = 1 as well as in the
others (n = 0, n = -1, n = 2, 3,...32) an account for the five-loop term is
found to shift the Wilson fixed point location only briefly, leaving it outside
the segment formed by the results of the corresponding lattice calculations;
even error bars of the RG and lattice estimates do not overlap in the most
cases studied. This is argued to reflect the influence of the singular
(non-analytical) contribution to the \beta-function that can not be found
perturbatively. The evaluation of the critical exponents for n = 1, n = 0 and n
= -1 in the five-loop approximation and comparison of the numbers obtained with
their known exact counterparts confirm the conclusion that non-analytical
contributions are visible in two dimensions. For the 2D Ising model, the
estimates \omega = 1.31(3) for the correction-to-scaling exponent is found that
is close to the value 4/3 resulting from the conformal invariance.
