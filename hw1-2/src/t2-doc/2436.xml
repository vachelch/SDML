Complexified Gravity in Noncommutative Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The presence of a constant background antisymmetric tensor for open strings
or D-branes forces the space-time coordinates to be noncommutative. This effect
is equivalent to replacing ordinary products in the effective theory by the
deformed star product. An immediate consequence of this is that all fields get
complexified. The only possible noncommutative Yang-Mills theory is the one
with U(N) gauge symmetry. By applying this idea to gravity one discovers that
the metric becomes complex. We show in this article that this procedure is
completely consistent and one can obtain complexified gravity by gauging the
symmetry $U(1,D-1)$ instead of the usual $SO(1,D-1)$. The final theory depends
on a Hermitian tensor containing both the symmetric metric and antisymmetric
tensor. In contrast to other theories of nonsymmetric gravity the action is
both unique and gauge invariant. The results are then generalized to
noncommutative spaces.
