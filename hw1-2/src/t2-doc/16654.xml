The Supersymmetric Two Boson Hierarchies
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the most general supersymmetric two boson system that is
integrable. We obtain the Lax operator and the nonstandard Lax representation
for this system. We show that, under appropriate redefinition of variables,
this reduces to the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation without any
arbitrary parameter which is known to be integrable. We show that this
supersymmetric system has three local Hamiltonian structures just like the
bosonic counterpart and we show how the supersymmetric KdV equation can be
embedded into this system.
