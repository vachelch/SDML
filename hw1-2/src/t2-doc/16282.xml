Physical Consequences of Nonabelian Duality in the Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Possible physical consequences of a recently discovered nonabelian dual
symmetry are explored in the standard model. It is found that both Higgs fields
and fermion generations can be assigned a natural place in the dual framework,
with Higgs fields appearing as frames (or `N-beins') in internal symmetry
space, and generations appearing as spontaneously broken dual colour. Fermions
then occur in exactly 3 generations and have a factorizable mass matrix which
gives automatically one generation much heavier than the other two. The CKM
matrix is the identity at zeroth order, but acquires mixing through higher loop
corrections. Preliminary considerations are given to calculating the CKM matrix
and lower generation masses. New vector and Higgs bosons are predicted.
