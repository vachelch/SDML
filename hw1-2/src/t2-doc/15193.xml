Strong-weak coupling duality in anisotropic current interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  The recently proposed all orders beta function is further investigated. By
using a strong-weak coupling duality of the beta function, and some added
topology of the space of couplings we are able to extend the flows to
arbitrarily large or small scales. Using a non-trivial RG invariant we are able
to identify sine-Gordon, sinh-Gordon and Kosterlitz-Thouless phases. We also
find an additional phase with cyclic or roaming RG trajectories.
