General Static Spherical Solutions of d-dimensional Charged Dilaton
  Gravity Theories

<abstract>
  We get the general static, spherically symmetric solutions of the
d-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theories by dimensionally reducing
them to a class of 2-dimensional dilaton gravity theories. By studying the
symmetries of the actions for the static equations of motion, we find field
redefinitions that nearly reduce these theories to the d-dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar theories, and therefore enable us to get the exact
solutions. We do not make any assumption about the asymptotic space-time
structure. As a result, our 4-dimensional solutions contain the asymptotically
flat Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) solutions and the non-asymptotically
flat Chan-Horne-Mann (CHM) solutions. Besides, we find some new solutions with
a finite range of allowed radius of the transversal sphere. These results
generalize to an arbitrary space-time dimension d (d>3).
