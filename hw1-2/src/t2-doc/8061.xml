Branes in Time-Dependent Backgrounds and AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We study supergravity solutions of Dp-branes in the time-dependent orbifold
background. We show that worldvolume theories decouple from the bulk gravity
for p less than six. Along AdS/CFT correspondence, these solutions could
provide the gravity description of noncommutative field theory with
time-dependent noncommutative parameter. Type II NS5-brane (M5-brane) in the
presence of RR n-form for n=0,..., 4 (C field) in this time-dependent
background have also been studied.
