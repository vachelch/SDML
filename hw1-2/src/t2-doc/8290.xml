Dynamical Lorentz simmetry breaking from 3+1 Axion-Wess-Zumino model
</title>

  We study the renormalizable abelian vector-field models in the presence of
the Wess-Zumino interaction with the pseudoscalar matter. The renormalizability
is achieved by supplementing the standard kinetic term of vector fields with
higher derivatives. The appearance of fourth power of momentum in the
vector-field propagator leads to the super-renormalizable theory in which the
$\beta$-function, the vector-field renormalization constant and the anomalous
mass dimension are calculated exactly. It is shown that this model has the
infrared stable fixed point and its low-energy limit is non-trivial. The
modified effective potential for the pseudoscalar matter leads to the possible
occurrence of dynamical breaking of the Lorentz symmetry. This phenomenon is
related to the modification of Electrodynamics by means of the Chern-Simons
(CS) interaction polarized along a constant CS vector. Its presence makes the
vacuum optically active that has been recently estimated from astrophysical
data. We examine two possibilities for the CS vector to be time-like or
space-like, under the assumption that it originates from v.e.v. of some
pseudoscalar matter and show that only the latter one is consistent in the
framework of the AWZ model, because a time-like CS vector makes the vacuum
unstable under pairs creation of tachyonic photon modes with the finite vacuum
decay rate.
