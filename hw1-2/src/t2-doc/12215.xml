Duality in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this lecture we review some of the recent developments in string theory on
an introductory and qualitative level. In particular we focus on S-T-U
dualities of toroidally compactified ten-dimensional string theories and
outline the connection to M-theory. Dualities among string vacua with less
supersymmetries in six and four space-time dimensions is discussed and the
concept of F-theory is briefly presented. (Lecture given by J. Louis at the
Workshop on Gauge Theories, Applied Supersymmetry and Quantum Gravity, Imperial
College, London, UK, July 5--10, 1996.)
