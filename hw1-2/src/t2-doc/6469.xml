Randomly coupled minimal models
</title>

<abstract>
  Using 1-loop renormalisation group equations, we analyze the effect of
randomness on multi-critical unitary minimal conformal models. We study the
case of two randomly coupled $M_p$ models and found that they flow in two
decoupled $M_{p-1}$ models, in the infra-red limit. This result is then extend
to the case with $M$ randomly coupled $M_p$ models, which will flow toward $M$
decoupled $M_{p-1}$.
