Construction of Simple $q$-Deformed Algebras by Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  The simple algebras of a dressed operator, which is composed of a dressing
and a residual operators, are averaged following a proper statistics of the
dressing one. In the Bose-Einstein statistics, a (fermionic) Calogero-Vasiliev
oscillator, $q$-boson (fermion), and (fermionic) $su_q(1,1)$ are obtained for
each bosonic (fermionic) residual operator. In the Fermi-Dirac statistics, new
similar algebras are derived for each residual operator. Constructions of dual
$q$-algebras, such as a dual Calogero-Vasiliev oscillator, a dual $q$-boson and
a $su_q(2)$, and prospects are discussed.
