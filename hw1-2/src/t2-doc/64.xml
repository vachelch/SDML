Orbifold analysis of broken bulk symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  In two-dimensional conformal field theory, we analyze conformally invariant
boundary conditions which break part of the bulk symmetries. When the
subalgebra that is preserved by the boundary conditions is the fixed algebra
under the action of a finite group G, orbifold techniques can be used to
determine the structure of the space of such boundary conditions. We present
explicit results for the case when G is abelian. In particular, we construct a
classifying algebra which controls these symmetry breaking boundary conditions
in the same way in which the fusion algebra governs the boundary conditions
that preserve the full bulk symmetry.
