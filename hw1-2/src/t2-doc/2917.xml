No Go Theorem for Self Tuning Solutions With Gauss-Bonnet Terms
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider self tuning solutions for a brane embedded in an anti de Sitter
spacetime. We include the higher derivative Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action
and study singularity free solutions with finite effective Newton's constant.
Using the methods of Csaki et al, we prove that such solutions, when exist,
always require a fine tuning among the brane parameters. We then present a new
method of analysis in which the qualitative features of the solutions can be
seen easily without obtaining the solutions explicitly. Also, the origin of the
fine tuning is transparent in this method.
