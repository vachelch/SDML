OSp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian quantization of irreducible massive gauge
  theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The osp(1,2)-covariant Lagrangian quantization of general gauge theories is
formulated which applies also to massive fields. The formalism generalizes the
Sp(2)-covariant BLT approach and guarantees symplectic invariance of the
quantized action. The dependence of the generating functional of Green's
functions on the choice of gauge in the massive case disappears in the limit m
= 0. Ward identities related to osp(1,2) symmetry are derived. Massive gauge
theories with closed algebra are studied as an example.
