  Invited talk given at the ``International Workshop on `Symmetry Methods in
Physics' in memory of Ya.\ A.\ Smorodinsky, 5--10 July 1993, Dubna, Russia; to
appear in the proceedings. In this contribution I present further results on
steps towards a Table of Feynman Path Integrals. Whereas the usual path
integral solutions of the harmonic oscillator (Gaussian path integrals), of the
radial harmonic oscillator (Besselian path integrals), and the (modified)
P\"oschl-Teller potential(s) (Legendrian path integrals) are well known and can
be performed explicitly by exploiting the convolution properties of the various
types, a perturbative method opens other possibilities for calculating path
integrals. Here I want to demonstrate the perturbation expansion method for
point interactions and boundary problems in path integrals.
