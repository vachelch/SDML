Solutions of the Yang-Baxter Equation with Extra Non-Additive Parameters
  II: $U_q(gl(m|n))$}
</title>

<abstract>
  The type-I quantum superalgebras are known to admit non-trivial one-parameter
families of inequivalent finite dimensional irreps, even for generic $q$. We
apply the recently developed technique to construct new solutions to the
quantum Yang-Baxter equation associated with the one-parameter family of irreps
of $U_q(gl(m|n))$, thus obtaining R-matrices which depend not only on a
spectral parameter but in addition on further continuous parameters. These
extra parameters enter the Yang-Baxter equation in a similar way to the
spectral parameter but in a non-additive form.
