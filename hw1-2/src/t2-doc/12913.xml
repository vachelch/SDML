Collective Coordinate Quantization: Relativistic and Gauge Symmetric
  Aspects
</title>

<abstract>
  The introduction and quantization of a center-of-mass coordinate is
demonstrated for the one-soliton sector of nonlinear field theories in (1+1)
dimensions. The present approach strongly emphazises the gauge and
BRST-symmetry aspects of collective coordinate quantization. A gauge is
presented which is independent of any approximation scheme and which allows to
interpret the new degree of freedom as the {\em quantized} center of mass
coordinate of a soliton. Lorentz invariance is used from the beginning to
introduce fluctuations of the collective coordinate in the {\em rest frame} of
the {\em moving} soliton. It turns out that due to the extended nature of the
soliton retardation effects lead to differences in the quantum mechanics of the
soliton as compared to a point-like particle. Finally, the results of the
semiclassical expansion are used to analyse effective soliton-meson vertices
and the coupling to an external source. Such a coupling in general causes
acceleration as well as internal excitation of the soliton.
