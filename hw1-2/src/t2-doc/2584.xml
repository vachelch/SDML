Backreaction of excitations on a vortex
</title>

<abstract>
  Excitations of a vortex are usually considered in a linear approximation
neglecting their backreaction on the vortex. In the present paper we
investigate backreaction of Proca type excitations on a straightlinear vortex
in the Abelian Higgs model. We propose exact Ansatz for fields of the excited
vortex. From initial set of six nonlinear field equations we obtain (in a limit
of weak excitations) two linear wave equations for the backreaction
corrections. Their approximate solutions are found in the cases of plane wave
and wave packet type excitations. We find that the excited vortex radiates
vector field and that the Higgs field has a very broad oscillating component.
