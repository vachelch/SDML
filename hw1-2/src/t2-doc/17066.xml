State-Space Based Approach to Particle Creation in Spatially Uniform
  Electric Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Our formalism described recently in (Dolby et al, hep-th/0103228) is applied
to the study of particle creation in spatially uniform electric fields,
concentrating on the cases of a time-invariant electric field and a so-called
`adiabatic' electric field. Several problems are resolved by incorporating the
`Bogoliubov coefficient' approach and the `tunnelling' approaches into a single
consistent, gauge invariant formulation. The value of a time-dependent particle
interpretation is demonstrated by presenting a coherent account of the
time-development of the particle creation process, in which the particles are
created with small momentum (in the frame of the electric field) and are then
accelerated by the electric field to make up the `bulge' of created particles
predicted by asymptotic calculations. An initial state comprising one particle
is also considered, and its evolution is described as being the sum of two
contributions: the `sea of current' produced by the evolved vacuum, and the
extra current arising from the initial particle state.
