D-instanton probes of N=2 non-conformal geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  D-instanton calculus has proved to be able to probe the AdS near horizon
geometry for $N$ D-branes systems which, when decoupled from gravity, yield
four dimensional superconformal gauge theories with various matter content. In
this work we extend previous analysis to encompass fractional brane models
which give rise to non conformal N=2 Super Yang-Mills theories. Via D-instanton
calculus we study the geometry of such models for finite $N$ and recover the
$\beta$ function of the gauge coupling constants which is expected in non
conformal gauge theories. We also give a topological matrix theory formulation
for the D-instanton action of these theories. Finally, we revisit the related
system where the D3-branes wrap a ${\real}^4/{\zet}_p$ orbifold singularity and
the D(-1) branes are associated to instanton solutions of four-dimensional
gauge theories in the blown down ALE space.
