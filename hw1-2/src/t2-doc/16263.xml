Multi-Instantons, Supersymmetry and Topological Field Theories

<abstract>
  In this letter we argue that instanton-dominated Green's functions in N=2
Super Yang-Mills theories can be equivalently computed either using the
so-called constrained instanton method or making reference to the topological
twisted version of the theory. Defining an appropriate BRST operator (as a
supersymmetry plus a gauge variation), we also show that the expansion
coefficients of the Seiberg-Witten effective action for the low-energy degrees
of freedom can be written as integrals of total derivatives over the moduli
space of self-dual gauge connections.
