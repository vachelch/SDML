BPS black holes in N=2 five dimensional AdS supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  BPS black hole solutions of U(1) gauged five-dimensional supergravity are
obtained by solving the Killing spinor equations. These extremal static black
holes live in an asymptotic AdS_5 space time. Unlike black holes in asymptotic
flat space time none of them possess a regular horizon. We also calculate the
influence, of a particular class of these solutions, on the Wilson loops
calculation.
