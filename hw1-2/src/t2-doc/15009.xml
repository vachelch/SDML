Thermodynamics of 2D string theory

<abstract>
  We calculate the free energy, energy and entropy in the matrix quantum
mechanical formulation of 2D string theory in a background strongly perturbed
by tachyons with the imaginary Minkowskian momentum $\pm i/R$
(``Sine-Liouville'' theory). The system shows a thermodynamical behaviour
corresponding to the temperature $T=1/(2\pi R)$. We show that the
microscopically calculated energy of the system satisfies the usual
thermodynamical relations and leads to a non-zero entropy.
