Functional integral approach to multipoint correlators in 2d critical
  systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend a previously developed technique for computing spin-spin critical
correlators in the 2d Ising model, to the case of multiple correlations. This
enables us to derive Kadanoff-Ceva's formula in a simple and elegant way. We
also exploit a doubling procedure in order to evaluate the critical exponent of
the polarization operator in the Baxter model. Thus we provide a rigorous proof
of the relation between different exponents, in the path-integral framework.
