Solitonic Integrable Perturbations of Parafermionic Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum integrability of a class of massive perturbations of the
parafermionic conformal field theories associated to compact Lie groups is
established by showing that they have quantum conserved densities of scale
dimension 2 and 3. These theories are integrable for any value of a continuous
vector coupling constant, and they generalize the perturbation of the minimal
parafermionic models by their first thermal operator. The classical
equations-of-motion of these perturbed theories are the non-abelian affine Toda
equations which admit (charged) soliton solutions whose semi-classical
quantization is expected to permit the identification of the exact S-matrix of
the theory.
