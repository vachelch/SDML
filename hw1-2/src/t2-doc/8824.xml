Comments on Noncommutative Perturbative Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze further the IR singularities that appear in noncommutative field
theories on R^d. We argue that all IR singularities in nonplanar one loop
diagrams may be interpreted as arising from the tree level exchanges of new
light degrees of freedom, one coupling to each relevant operator. These
exchanges are reminiscent of closed string exchanges in the double twist
diagrams in open string theory. Some of these degrees of freedom are required
to have propagators that are inverse linear or logarithmic. We suggest that
these can be interpreted as free propagators in one or two extra dimensions
respectively. We also calculate some of the IR singular terms appearing at two
loops in noncommutative scalar field theories and find a complicated momentum
dependence which is more difficult to interpret.
