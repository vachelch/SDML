On the Classification of Diagonal Coset Modular Invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  We relate in a novel way the modular matrices of GKO diagonal cosets without
fixed points to those of WZNW tensor products. Using this we classify all
modular invariant partition functions of $su(3)_k\oplus su(3)_1/su(3)_{k+1}$
for all positive integer level $k$, and $su(2)_k\oplus
su(2)_\ell/su(2)_{k+\ell}$ for all $k$ and infinitely many $\ell$ (in fact, for
each $k$ a positive density of $\ell$). Of all these classifications, only that
for $su(2)_k\oplus su(2)_1/su(2)_{k+1}$ had been known. Our lists include many
new invariants.
