p-brane Dyons, theta-terms and Dimensional Reduction
</title>

<abstract>
  We present two novel derivations of the recently established $(-)^p$ factor
in the charge quantization condition for $p$-brane dyon sources in spacetime
dimension $D$=$2p$+2. The first requires consistency of the condition under the
charge shifts produced by (generalized) $\theta$-terms. The second traces the
sign difference between adjoining dimensions to compactification effects.
