Partially embedding of the quantum mechanical analog of the nonlinear
  sigma model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the quantum mechanical analog of the nonlinear sigma model. There
are difficulties to completely embed this theory by directly using the Batalin,
Fradkin, Fradkina, and Tyutin (BFFT) formalism. We show in this paper how the
BFFT method can be conveniently adapted in order to achieve a gauge theory that
partially embeds the model.
