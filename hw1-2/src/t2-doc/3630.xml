Zero Modes for the D=11 Membrane and Five-Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  There exist extremal p-brane solutions of $D\!=\!11$ supergravity for
p=2~and~5. In this paper we investigate the zero modes of the membrane and the
five-brane solutions as a first step toward understanding the full quantum
theory of these objects. It is found that both solutions possess the correct
number of normalizable zero modes dictated by supersymmetry.
