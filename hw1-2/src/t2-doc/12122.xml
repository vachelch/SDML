Chiral primary cubic interactions from pp-wave supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly construct cubic interaction light-cone Hamiltonian for the
chiral primary system involving the metric fields and the self-dual four-form
fields in the IIB pp-wave supergravity. The background fields representing
pp-waves exhibit SO(4)*SO(4)*Z_2 invariance. It turns out that the interaction
Hamiltonian is precisely the same as that for the dilaton-axion system, except
for the fact that the chiral primary system fields have the opposite parity to
that of the dilaton-axion fields under the Z_2 transformation that exchanges
two SO(4)'s.
