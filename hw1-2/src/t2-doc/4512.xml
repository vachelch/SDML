Quaternionic potentials in non-relativistic quantum mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the Schrodinger equation in presence of quaternionic potentials.
The study is performed analytically as long as it proves possible, when not, we
resort to numerical calculations. The results obtained could be useful to
investigate an underlying quaternionic quantum dynamics in particle physics.
Experimental tests and proposals to observe quaternionic quantum effects by
neutron interferometry are briefly reviewed.
