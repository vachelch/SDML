Gedanken Experiments involving Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Analysis of several gedanken experiments indicates that black hole
complementarity cannot be ruled out on the basis of known physical principles.
Experiments designed by outside observers to disprove the existence of a
quantum-mechanical stretched horizon require knowledge of Planck-scale effects
for their analysis. Observers who fall through the event horizon after sampling
the Hawking radiation cannot discover duplicate information inside the black
hole before hitting the singularity. Experiments by outside observers to detect
baryon number violation will yield significant effects well outside the
stretched horizon.
