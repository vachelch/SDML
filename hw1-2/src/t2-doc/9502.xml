SD Perturbiner in YM+Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  An explicit self-dual classical solution of the type of perturbiner in
Yang-Mills theory interacting with gravity is obtained. This allows one to
describe the tree self-dual gluonic form-factors including any number of
positive-helicity gravitons in addition to the positive helicity gluons.
