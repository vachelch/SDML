Seiberg Duality in Matrix Models II
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we continue the investigation, within the context of the
Dijkgraaf-Vafa Programme, of Seiberg duality in matrix models as initiated in
hep-th/0211202, by allowing degenerate mass deformations. In this case, there
are some massless fields which remain and the theory has a moduli space. With
this illustrative example, we propose a general methodology for performing the
relevant matrix model integrations and addressing the corresponding field
theories which have non-trivial IR behaviour, and which may or may not have
tree-level superpotentials.
