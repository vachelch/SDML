Possible quantum obstructions to the process of Abelian conversion
</title>

<abstract>
  The procedure for Abelian conversion of second class constraints due to
Batalin, Fradkin, Fradkina and Tyutin is considered at quantum level, by using
the field-antifield formalism. It is argued that quantum effects can obstruct
the process. In this case, Wess-Zumino fields may be introduced in order to
restore the lost symmetries.
