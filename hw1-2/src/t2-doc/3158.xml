Phase Transition in Spherically Symmetric Gravitational Collapse of a
  Massless Scalar Field
</title>

<abstract>
  Phase transition in spherically symmetric collapse of a massless scalar field
is studied in 4-d Einstein gravity. A class of exact solutions that show the
evolution of a constant incoming energy flux turned on at a point in the past
null infinity are constructed to serve as an explicit example. The recently
discovered phase transition in this system via numerical methods
\cite{choptuik} is manifest; above a threshold value of the incooming energy
flux, a black hole is dynamically formed and below that, the incoming flux is
reflected forward into the future null infinity. The critical exponent is
evaluated and discussed using the solutions.
