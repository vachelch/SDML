The Free Energy of N=4 Super-Yang-Mills and the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the high-temperature limit of the free energy for four-dimensional
N=4 supersymmetric SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory. At weak coupling we do so for a
general ultrastatic background spacetime, and in the presence of slowly-varying
background gauge fields. Using Maldacena's conjectured duality, we calculate
the strong-coupling large-N_c expression for the special case that the
three-space has constant curvature. We compare the two results paying
particular attention to curvature corrections to the leading order expressions.
