A Note on N=2 Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we investigate the generalised critical $N=2$ superstrings in
$(1,2p)$ spacetime signature. We calculate the four-point functions for the
tachyon operators of these theories. In contrast to the usual $N=2$ superstring
in $(2,2)$ spacetime, the four-point functions do not vanish. The exchanged
particles of the four-point function are included in the physical spectrum of
the corresponding theory and have vanishing fermion charge.
