Path Integral Discussion of Two and- Three-Dimensional $\delta$-Function
  Perturbations
</title>

<abstract>
  The incorporation of two- and three-dimensional $\delta$-function
perturbations into the path-integral formalism is discussed. In contrast to the
one-dimensional case, a regularization procedure is needed due to the
divergence of the Green-function $G^{(V)}(\vec x,\vec y;E)$, ($\vec x,\vec
y\in\bbbr^2,\bbbr^3$) for $\vec x=\vec y$, corresponding to a potential problem
$V(\vec x)$. The known procedure to define proper self-adjoint extensions for
Hamiltonians with deficiency indices can be used to regularize the path
integral, giving a perturbative approach for $\delta$-function perturbations in
two and three dimensions in the context of path integrals. Several examples
illustrate the formalism.
