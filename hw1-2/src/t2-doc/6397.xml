The Real Wick Rotations in Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss Wick rotations in the context of gravity, with emphasis on a
non-perturbative Wick rotation proposed in hep-th/0103186 mapping real
Lorentzian metrics to real Euclidean metrics in proper-time coordinates. As an
application, we demonstrate how this Wick rotation leads to a correct answer
for a two dimensional non-perturbative path-integral.
