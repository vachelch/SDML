On the Infrared Limit of Two Dimensional QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the infrared limit of two dimensional QCD, with massless dynamical
Dirac fermions that are in the fundamental representation of the gauge group.
We find that the theory reduces to a spin generalization of the Calogero model
with an additional magnetic coupling which is of the Pauli type.
