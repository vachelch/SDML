No saturation of the quantum Bogomolnyi bound by two-dimensional
  supersymmetric solitons
</title>

  We reanalyse the question whether the quantum Bogomolnyi bound is saturated
in the two-dimensional supersymmetric kink and sine-Gordon models. Our starting
point is the usual expression for the one-loop correction to the mass of a
soliton in terms of sums over zero-point energies. To regulate these sums, most
authors put the system in a box with suitable boundary conditions, and impose
an ultraviolet cut-off. We distinguish between an energy cut-off and a mode
number cut-off, and show that they lead to different results. We claim that
only the mode cut-off yields correct results, and only if one considers exactly
the same number of bosonic and fermionic modes in the total sum over
bound-state and zero-point energies. To substantiate this claim, we show that
in the sine-Gordon model only the mode cut-off yields a result for the quantum
soliton mass that is consistent with the exact result for the spectrum as
obtained by Dashen et al. from quantising the so-called breather solution. In
the supersymmetric case, our conclusion is that contrary to previous claims the
quantum Bogomolnyi bound is not saturated in any of the two-dimensional models
considered.
