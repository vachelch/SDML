Boundary Fermions, Coherent Sheaves and D-branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct boundary conditions in the gauged linear sigma model for B-type
D-branes on Calabi-Yau manifolds that correspond to coherent sheaves given by
the cohomology of a monad. This necessarily involves the introduction of
boundary fields, and in particular, boundary fermions. The large-volume
monodromy for these D-brane configurations is implemented by the introduction
of boundary contact terms. We also discuss the construction of D-branes
associated to coherent sheaves that are the cohomology of complexes of
arbitrary length. We illustrate the construction using examples, specifically
those associated with the large-volume analogues of the Recknagel-Schomerus
states with no moduli. Using some of these examples we also construct D-brane
states that arise as bound states of the above rigid configurations and show
how moduli can be counted in these cases.
