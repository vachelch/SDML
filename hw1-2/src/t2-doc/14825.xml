Codimension Two Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  A holographic interpretation for some specific Ricci flat string backgrounds
of the form $A_6\times C_4$ is proposed. The conjecture is that there is a
Four-dimensional Euclidean Conformal Field Theory (ECFT) defined on a
codimension two {\em submanifold} of the manifold $A_6$ (where one of the two
remaining {\em holographic} coordinates of $A_6$ is timelike, and the other one
spacelike), with central charge proportional to the radius of curvature of the
six-dimensional manifold, $c\sim l^4$.
