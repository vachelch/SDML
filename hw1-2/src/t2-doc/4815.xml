On the Fedosov Deformation Quantization beyond the Regular Poisson
  Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple iterative procedure is suggested for the deformation quantization of
(irregular) Poisson brackets associated to the classical Yang-Baxter equation.
The construction is shown to admit a pure algebraic reformulation giving the
Universal Deformation Formula (UDF) for any triangular Lie bialgebra. A simple
proof of classification theorem for inequivalent UDF's is given. As an example
the explicit quantization formula is presented for the quasi-homogeneous
Poisson brackets on two-plane.
