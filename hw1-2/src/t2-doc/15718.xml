The Enhancon and N=2 Gauge Theory/Gravity RG Flows
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the family of ten dimensional type IIB supergravity solutions
corresponding to renormalisation group flows from N=4 to N=2 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory. Part of the solution set corresponds to a submanifold of the
Coulomb branch of the gauge theory, and we use a D3-brane probe to uncover
details of this physics. At generic places where supergravity is singular, the
smooth physics of the probe yields the correct one-loop form of the effective
low energy gauge coupling. The probe becomes tensionless on a ring at finite
radius. Supergravity flows which end on this ``enhancon'' ring correspond to
the vacua where extra massless degrees of freedom appear in the gauge theory,
and the gauge coupling diverges there. We identify an SL(2,Z) duality action on
the enhancon ring which relates the special vacua, and comment on the massless
dyons within them. We propose that the supergravity solution inside the
enhancon ring should be excised, since the probe's tension is unphysical there.
