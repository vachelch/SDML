Our World as an Intersection of Walls and a String
</title>

<abstract>
  A solution of Einstein equations is obtained for our four-dimensional world
as an intersection of a wall and a string-like defect in seven-dimensional
spacetime with a negative cosmological constant. A matter energy-momentum
tensor localized on the wall and on the string is needed. A single massless
graviton is found and is localized around the intersection. The leading
correction to the gravitational Newton potential from massive spin 2 graviton
is found to be almost identical to that of a wall in five dimensions, contrary
to the case of a string in six dimensions. The generalization to the
intersection of a string and $n$ orthogonally intersecting walls is also
obtained and a similar result is found for the gravitational potential.
