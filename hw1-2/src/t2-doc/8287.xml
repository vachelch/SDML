On the Space-Time Symmetries of Non-Commutative Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the space-time symmetries and transformation properties of the
non-commutative U(1) gauge theory, by using Noether charges. We carry out our
analysis by keeping an open view on the possible ways $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ could
transform. We conclude that $\theta^{\mu \nu}$ cannot transform under any
space-time transformation since the theory is not invariant under the conformal
transformations, with the only exception of space-time translations. The same
analysis applies to other gauge groups.
