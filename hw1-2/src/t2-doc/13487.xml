Effective d=2 supersymmetric Lagrangians from d=1 supermatrix models
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss $d=1, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric matrix models and exhibit the
associated $d=2$ collective field theory in the limit of dense eigenvalues.
From this theory we construct, by the addition of several new fields, a $d=2$
supersymmetric effective field theory, which reduces to the collective field
theory when the new fields are replaced with their vacuum expectation values.
This effective theory is Poincare invariant and contains perturbative and
non-perturbative information about the associated superstrings. We exhibit
instanton solutions corresponding to the motion of single eigenvalues and
discuss their possible role in supersymmetry breaking.
