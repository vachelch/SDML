Vector Supersymmetry and Finite Quantum Correction of Chern-Simons
  Theory in the Light-Cone Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  Vector supersymmetry is shown to exist also in light-cone gauge Chern-Simons
theory. Using a gauge invariant regularization scheme, we demonstrate
explicitly that the finite quantum correction to the coupling constant of
Chern-Simons theory is intimately associated with the breaking of vector
supersymmetry at the regularization level. The advantage of investigating such
a quantum phenomenon in the light-cone gauge is emphasized and the BRST and
vector supersymmetry invariance of quantum effective action is discussed.
