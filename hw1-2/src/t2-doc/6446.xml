On Superconnections and the Tachyon Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a form of the effective action of the tachyon and gauge fields for
brane-antibrane systems and non-BPS Dp-branes, written in terms of the
supercurvature. Kink and vortex solutions with constant infinite gauge field
strength reproduce the exact tensions of the lower-dimensional D-branes. We
discuss the relation to BSFT and other models in the literature.
