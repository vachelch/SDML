Super D-branes revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  A version of the kappa-symmetric super D-p-brane action is presented in which
the tension is a dynamical variable, equal to the flux of a p-form worldvolume
gauge field. The Lagrangian is shown to be invariant under all
(super)isometries of the background for appropriate transformations of the
worldvolume gauge fields, which determine the central charges in the symmetry
algebra. We also present the Hamiltonian form of the action in a general
supergravity background.
