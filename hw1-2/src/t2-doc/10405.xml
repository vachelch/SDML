Superstring Interactions in a pp-wave Background II
</title>

<abstract>
  In type IIB light-cone superstring field theory, the cubic interaction has
two pieces: a delta-functional overlap and an operator inserted at the
interaction point. In this paper we extend our earlier work hep-th/0204146 by
computing the matrix elements of this operator in the oscillator basis of
pp-wave string theory for all mu p^+ alpha'. By evaluating these matrix
elements for large mu p^+ alpha', we check a recent conjecture relating matrix
elements of the light-cone string field theory Hamiltonian (with prefactor) to
certain three-point functions of BMN operators in the gauge theory. We also
make several explicit predictions for gauge theory.
