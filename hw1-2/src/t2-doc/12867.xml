Large N Phase Transitions and Multi-Critical Behaviour in Generalized 2D
  QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Using matrix model techniques we investigate the large N limit of generalized
2D Yang-Mills theory. The model has a very rich phase structure. It exhibits
multi-critical behavior and reveals a third order phase transitions at all
genera besides {\it torus}. This is to be contrasted with ordinary 2D
Yang-Mills which, at large N, exhibits phase transition only for spherical
topology.
