On Gauge Invariance and Ward Identities for the Wilsonian
  Renormalisation Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate non-Abelian gauge theories within a Wilsonian Renormalisation
Group approach. The cut-off term inherent in this approach leads to a modified
Ward identity (mWI). It is shown that this mWI is compatible with the flow and
that the full effective action satisfies the usual Ward identity (WI). The
universal 1-loop beta-function is derived within this approach and the
extension to the 2-loop level is briefly outlined.
