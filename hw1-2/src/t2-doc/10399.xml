N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and Supersymmetric 3-cycles
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we discuss the strong coupling limit of chiral N=1
supersymmetric gauge theory via their embedding into M-theory. In particular we
focus on the brane box models of Hanany and Zaffaroni and show that after a
T-duality transformation their M-theory embedding is described by
supersymmetric 3-cycles; its geometry will encode the holomorphic
non-perturbative information about the gauge theory.
