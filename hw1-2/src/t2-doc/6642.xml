Integrable Lattice Realizations of N=1 Superconformal Boundary
  Conditions

<abstract>
  We construct integrable boundary conditions for sl(2) coset models with
central charges c=3/2-12/(m(m+2)) and m=3,4,... The associated cylinder
partition functions are generating functions for the branching functions but
these boundary conditions manifestly break the superconformal symmetry. We show
that there are additional integrable boundary conditions, satisfying the
boundary Yang-Baxter equation, which respect the superconformal symmetry and
lead to generating functions for the superconformal characters in both Ramond
and Neveu-Schwarz sectors. We also present general formulas for the cylinder
partition functions. This involves an alternative derivation of the
superconformal Verlinde formula recently proposed by Nepomechie.
