Symbolic Algebra and Renormalization of Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Symbolic algebra relevant to the renormalization of gauge theories can be
efficiently performed by machine using modern packages. We devise a scheme for
representing and manipulating the objects involved in perturbative calculations
of gauge theories. This scheme is readily implemented using the general purpose
package, Mathematica. The techniques discussed are used to calculate
renormalization group functions for a non-abelian $SU(m)$ gauge theory with
massless fermions in a representation R, in the two-loop approximation, and to
simplify some expressions arising in electroweak calculations at the two loop
level.
