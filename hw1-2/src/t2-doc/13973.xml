Branes Intersecting at Angles
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that configurations of multiple D-branes related by SU(N) rotations
will preserve unbroken supersymmetry. This includes cases in which two D-branes
are related by a rotation of arbitrarily small angle, and we discuss some of
the physics of this. In particular, we discuss a way of obtaining 4D chiral
fermions on the intersection of D-branes.
  We also rephrase the condition for unbroken supersymmety as the condition
that a `generalized holonomy group' associated with the brane configuration and
manifold is reduced, and relate this condition (in Type IIA string theory) to a
condition in eleven dimensions.
