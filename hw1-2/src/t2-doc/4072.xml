One-loop effective action around de Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-local one-loop contribution to the gravitational effective action
around de Sitter space is computed using the background field method with pure
trace external gravitational fields and it is shown to vanish. The calculation
is performed in a generic covariant gauge and the result is verified to be
gauge invariant.
