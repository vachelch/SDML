The Question of Abelian Higgs Hair Expulsion from Extremal Dilaton Black
  Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been argued that the extremal dilaton black holes exhibit a flux
expulsion of Abelian-Higgs vortices. We re-examine carefully the problem and
give analytic proofs for the flux expulsion always takes place. We also conduct
numerical analysis of the problem using three initial data sets on the horizon
of an extreme dilatonic black hole, namely, core, vacuum and sinusoidal initial
conditions. We also show that an Abelian-Higgs vortex can end on the extremal
dilaton black hole. Concluding, we calculate the backreaction of the
Abelian-Higgs vortex on the geometry of the extremal black hole and drew a
conclusion that a straight cosmic string and the extreme dilaton black hole
hardly knew their presence.
