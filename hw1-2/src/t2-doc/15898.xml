Scattering of Noncommutative (n,1) Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study scattering of noncommutative solitons in 2+1 dimensional scalar
field theory. In particular, we investigate a system of two solitons with level
n and n' (the (n,n')-system) in the large noncommutativity limit. We show that
the scattering of a general (n,n')-system occurs at right angles in the case of
zero impact parameter. We also derive an exact Kahler potential and the metric
of the moduli space of the (n,1)-system. We examine numerically the (n,1)
scattering and find that the closest distance for a fixed scattering angle is
well approximated by a function a+b*sqrt{n} where a and b are some numerical
constants.
