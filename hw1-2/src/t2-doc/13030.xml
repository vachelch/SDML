Conformal Symmetry of Supergravities in AdS spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the background field method applied to supergravity in adS
space-time provides the path integral for the theory in the bulk with conformal
symmetry associated with the isometry of the adS space. This in turn allows to
establish the rigid conformal invariance of the generating functional for the
supergravity correlators on the boundary.
