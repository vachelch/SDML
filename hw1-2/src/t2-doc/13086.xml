BRST Symmetries for the Tangent Gauge Group
</title>

<abstract>
  For any principal bundle $P$, one can consider the subspace of the space of
connections on its tangent bundle $TP$ given by the tangent bundle $T{\cal A}$
of the space of connections ${\cal A}$ on $P$. The tangent gauge group acts
freely on $T{\cal A}$. Appropriate BRST operators are introduced for quantum
field theories that include as fields elements of $T{\cal A}$, as well as
tangent vectors to the space of curvatures. As the simplest application, the
BRST symmetry of the so-called $BF$-Yang-Mills theory is described and the
relevant gauge fixing conditions are analyzed. A brief account on the
topological $BF$ theories is also included and the relevant Batalin-Vilkovisky
operator is described.
