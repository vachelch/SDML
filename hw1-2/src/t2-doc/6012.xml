Energy Radiation from a Moving Mirror with Finite Mass
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study energy radiation from a moving mirror in 1+1
dimensional space-time. The mirror is assumed to have finite mass and
accordingly to receive back reaction from scalar photon field. The mode
expansion of the scalar field becomes different from that without back reaction
though the trajectory of the mirror is not changed. Then energy density of the
vacuum becomes to have finite value proportional to square of the mass of the
mirror. Moreover we compute the energy momentum tensor of the radiation in the
case that acceleration of the mirror is small. As a result we show that the
mirror creates energy radiation whose quantity does not depend on its mass but
on its acceleration even if the acceleration is uniform.
