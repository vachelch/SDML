Gravity Induced C-Deformation
</title>

<abstract>
  We study F-terms describing coupling of the supergravity to N=1
supersymmetric gauge theories which admit large N expansions. We show that
these F-terms are given by summing over genus one non-planar diagrams of the
large N expansion of the associated matrix model (or more generally bosonic
gauge theory). The key ingredient in this derivation is the observation that
the chiral ring of the gluino fields is deformed by the supergravity fields,
generalizing the C-deformation which was recently introduced. The gravity
induced part of the C-deformation can be derived from the Bianchi identities of
the supergravity, but understanding gravitational corrections to the F-terms
requires a non-traditional interpretation of these identities.
