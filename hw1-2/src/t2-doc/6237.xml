Planetoid strings : solutions and perturbations
</title>

<abstract>
  A novel ansatz for solving the string equations of motion and constraints in
generic curved backgrounds, namely the planetoid ansatz, was proposed
recently by some authors. We construct several specific examples of planetoid
strings in curved backgrounds which include Lorentzian wormholes, spherical
Rindler spacetime and the 2+1 dimensional black hole. A semiclassical
quantisation is performed and the Regge relations for the planetoids are
obtained. The general equations for the study of small perturbations about
these solutions are written down using the standard, manifestly covariant
formalism. Applications to special cases such as those of planetoid strings in
Minkowski and spherical Rindler spacetimes are also presented.
