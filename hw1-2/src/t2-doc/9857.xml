The Canonical Partition Function for Quons
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the canonical partition function $Z_N$ for a system of $N$ free
particles obeying so-called `quon' statistics where $q$ is real and satisfies
$|q|<1$ by using simple counting arguments. We observe that this system is
afflicted by the Gibbs paradox and that $Z_N$ is independent of $q$. We
demonstrate that such a system of particles obeys the ideal gas law and that
the internal energy $U$ ( and hence the specific heat capacity $C_V$ ) is
identical to that of a system of $N$ free particles obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann
statistics.
