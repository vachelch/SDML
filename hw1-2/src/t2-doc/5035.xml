Inflationary Theory versus Ekpyrotic/Cyclic Scenario
</title>

<abstract>
  I will discuss the development of inflationary theory and its present status,
as well as some recent attempts to suggest an alternative to inflation. In
particular, I will argue that the ekpyrotic scenario in its original form does
not solve any of the major cosmological problems. Meanwhile, the cyclic
scenario is not an alternative to inflation but rather a complicated version of
inflationary theory. This scenario does not solve the flatness and entropy
problems, and it suffers from the singularity problem. We describe many other
problems that need to be resolved in order to realize a cyclic regime in this
scenario, produce density perturbations of a desirable magnitude, and preserve
them after the singularity. We propose several modifications of this scenario
and conclude that the best way to improve it is to add a usual stage of
inflation after the singularity and use that inflationary stage to generate
perturbations in the standard way. This modification significantly simplifies
the cyclic scenario, eliminates all of its numerous problems, and makes it
equivalent to the usual chaotic inflation scenario.
