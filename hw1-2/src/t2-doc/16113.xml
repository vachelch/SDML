Exact solutions in multidimensional gravity with antisymmetric forms
</title>

<abstract>
  This topical review deals with a multidimensional gravitational model
containing dilatonic scalar fields and antisymmetric forms. The manifold is
chosen in the form M = M_0 x M_1 x ...x M_n, where M_i are Einstein spaces (i
>0). The sigma-model approach and exact solutions in the model are reviewed and
the solutions with p-branes (e.g. Majumdar-Papapetrou-type, cosmological,
spherically symmetric, black-brane and Freund-Rubin-type ones) are considered.
