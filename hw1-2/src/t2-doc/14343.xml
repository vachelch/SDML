Lie Superalgebra and Extended Topological Conformal Symmetry in
  Non-critical $W_{3}$ Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain a new free field realization of $N=2$ super $W_{3}$ algebra using
the technique of quantum hamiltonian reduction. The construction is based on a
particular choice of the simple root system of the affine Lie superalgebra
$sl(3|2)^{(1)}$ associated with a non-standard $sl(2)$ embedding. After
twisting and a similarity transformation, this $W$ algebra can be identified as
the extended topological conformal algebra of non-critical $W_{3}$ string
theory.
