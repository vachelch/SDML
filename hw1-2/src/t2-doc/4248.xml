N=1,2 4D Superconformal Field Theories and Supergravity in $AdS_5$
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider D3 branes world-volume theories substaining $N=1,2$
superconformal field theories. Under the assumption that these theories are
dual to $N=2,4$ supergravities in $AdS_5$, we explore the general structure of
the latter and discuss some issues when comparing the bulk theory to the
boundary singleton theory.
