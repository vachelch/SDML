A note on CFT dual of RS model with gauge fields in bulk
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been conjectured that the (weakly coupled) Randall-Sundrum (RS) model
with gauge fields in the bulk is dual to a (strongly coupled) 4D conformal
field theory (CFT) with an UV cut-off and in which global symmetries of the CFT
are gauged. We elucidate features of this dual CFT which are crucial for a
complete understanding of the proposed duality. We argue that the limit of no
(or small) brane-localized kinetic term for bulk gauge field on the RS side
(often studied in the literature) is dual to no bare kinetic term for the gauge
field which is coupled to the CFT global current. In this limit, the kinetic
term for this gauge field in the dual CFT is ``induced'' by CFT loops. Then,
this CFT loop contribution to the gauge field 1PI two-point function is dual
(on the RS side) to the full gauge propagator (i.e., including the contribution
of Kaluza-Klein and zero-modes) with both external points on the Planck brane.
We also emphasize that loop corrections to the gauge coupling on the RS side
are dual to sub-leading effects in a large-N expansion on the CFT side; these
sub-leading corrections to the gauge coupling in the dual CFT are (in general)
sensitive to the strong dynamics of the CFT.
