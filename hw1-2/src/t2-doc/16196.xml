Conformal non-Abelian Thirring models
</title>

<abstract>
  The Lie-Poisson structure of non-Abelian Thirring models is discussed and the
Hamiltonian quantization of these theories is carried out. The consistency of
the Hamiltonian quantization with the path integral method is established. It
is shown that the space of non-Abelian Thirring models contains the
nonperturbative conformal points which are in one-to-one correspondence with
general solutions of the Virasoro master equation. A BRST nature of the mastert
equation is clarified.
