Sewing Constraints and Non-Orientable Open Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend to non-orientable surfaces previous work on sewing constraints in
Conformal Field Theory. A new constraint, related to the real projective plane,
is described and is used to illustrate the correspondence with a previous
construction of open-string spectra.
