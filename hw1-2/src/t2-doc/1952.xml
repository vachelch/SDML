BFV-BRST analysis of equivalence between noncommutative and ordinary
  gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Constrained hamiltonian structure of noncommutative gauge theory for the
gauge group U(1) is discussed. Constraints are shown to be first class,
although, they do not give an Abelian algebra in terms of Poisson brackets. The
related BFV-BRST charge gives a vanishing generalized Poisson bracket by itself
due to the associativity of *-product. Equivalence of noncommutative and
ordinary gauge theories is formulated in generalized phase space by using
BFV-BRST charge and a solution is obtained. Gauge fixing is discussed.
