New brane solutions in higher order gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the higher order gravity with dilaton and with the leading string
theory corrections taken into account. The domain wall type solutions are
investigated for arbitrary number of space-time dimensions. The explicit
formulae for the fixed points and asymptotic behavior of generic solutions are
given. We analyze and classify solutions with finite effective gravitational
constant. There is a class of such solutions which have no singularities. We
discuss in detail the relation between fine tuning and self tuning and clarify
in which sense our solutions are fine-tuning free. The stability of such
solutions is also discussed.
