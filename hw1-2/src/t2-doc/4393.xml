Electroweak Phase Transition in Strong Magnetic Fields in the Standard
  Model of Elementary Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  The electroweak phase transition in the magnetic and hypermagnetic fields is
studied in the Standard Model on the base of investigation of symmetry
behaviour within the consistent effective potential of the scalar and magnetic
fields at finite temperature. It includes the one-loop and daisy diagram
contributions. All discovered fundamental fermions and bosons are taken into
consideration with their actual masses. The Higgs boson mass is chosen to be in
the energy interval 75 GeV $\le m_H \le$ 115 GeV. The effective potential
calculated is real at sufficiently high temperatures due to mutual cancellation
of the imaginary terms entering the one-loop and the daisy diagram parts.
Symmetry behaviour shows that neither the magnetic nor the hypermagnetic field
does not produce the sufficiently strong first order phase transition. For the
field strengths $H, H_Y$ $\ge 10^{23}$ G the electroweak phase transition is of
second order at all. Therefore, baryogenesis does not survive in the Standard
Model in smooth magnetic fields. The problems on generation of the fields at
high temperature and their stabilization are also discussed in a consistent
way. In particular, it is determined that the nonabelian component of the
magnetic field $ (gH)^{1/2} \sim g^{4/3}T$ has to be produced spontaneously. To
investigate the stability problem the $W$-boson mass operator in the magnetic
field at high temperature is calculated in one-loop approximation. The
comparison with results obtained in other approaches is done.
