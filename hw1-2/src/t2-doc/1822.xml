Second order perturbations in the radius stabilized Randall-Sundrum two
  branes model II -- Effect of relaxing strong coupling approximation --
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss gravitational perturbations in the Randall-Sundrum two branes
model with radius stabilization. Following the idea by Goldberger and Wise for
the radius stabilization, we introduce a scalar field which has potentials
localized on the branes in addition to a bulk potential. In our previous paper
we discussed gravitational perturbations induced by static, spherically
symmetric and nonrelativistic matter distribution on the branes under the
condition that the values of the scalar field on the respective branes cannot
fluctuate due to its extremely narrow brane potentials. We call this case the
strong coupling limit. Our concern in this paper is to generalize our previous
analysis relaxing the limitation of taking the strong coupling limit. We find
that new corrections in metric perturbations due to relaxing the strong
coupling limit enhance the deviation from the 4D Einstein gravity only in some
exceptional cases. In the case that matter fields reside on the negative
tension brane, the stabilized radion mass becomes very small when the new
correction becomes large.
