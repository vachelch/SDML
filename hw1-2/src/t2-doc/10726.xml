A polymer gas on a random surface
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the observation that configurations of N polymers with hard core
interactions on a closed random surface correspond to random surfaces with N
boundary components we calculate the free energy of a gas of polymers
interacting with fully quantized two-dimensional gravity. We derive the
equation of state for the polymer gas and find that all the virial coefficients
beyond the second one vanish identically.
