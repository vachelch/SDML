Perturbation theory in radial quantization approach and the expectation
  values of exponential fields in sine-Gordon model
</title>

<abstract>
  A perturbation theory for Massive Thirring Model (MTM) in radial quantization
approach is developed. Investigation of the twisted sector in this theory
allows us to calculate the vacuum expectation values of exponential fields $
exp iaphi (0) $ of the sine-Gordon theory in first order over Massive Thirring
Models coupling constant. It appears that the apparent difficulty in radial
quantization of massive theories, namely the explicite ''time'' dependence of
the Hamiltonian, may be successfully overcome. The result we have obtained
agrees with the exact formula conjectured by Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov and
coincides with the analogous calculations recently carried out in dual angular
quantization approach by one of the authors.
