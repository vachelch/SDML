Special Properties of Five Dimensional BPS Rotating Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetric, rotating, asymptotically flat black holes with a regular
horizon are rare configurations in String Theory. One example is known in five
spacetime dimensions, within the toroidal compactification of type IIB string
theory. Such special solution is allowed by the existence of a Chern-Simons
coupling in the Supergravity theory and by the possibility of imposing a self
duality condition on the `rotation 2-form'. We explore three peculiar features
of such black holes: 1) Oxidising to D=10 the five dimensional configuration
may be interpreted as a system of $D1-D5$ branes with a Brinkmann wave
propagating along their worldvolume. Unlike its five dimensional Kaluza-Klein
compactification, the universal covering space of this manifold has no
causality violations. In other words, causal anomalies can be solved in higher
dimensions. From the dual SCFT viewpoint, the causality bound for the
compactified spacetime arises as the unitarity bound; 2) The vanishing of the
scattering cross section for uncharged scalars and sufficiently high angular
momentum of the background is shown still to hold at the level of charged
interactions. The same is verified when a non-minimal coupling to the geometry
is used. Therefore, the `repulson' behaviour previously found is universal for
non accelerated observers; 3) The solutions are shown to have a non-standard
gyromagnetic ratio of $g=3$. In contrast, the superpartners of a static, BPS,
five dimensional black hole have $g=1$. At the semi-classical level, we find
that a Dirac fermion propagating in the rotating hole background has $g=2\pm1$,
depending on the spinor direction of the fermion being parallel to Killing or
`anti-Killing' spinors.
