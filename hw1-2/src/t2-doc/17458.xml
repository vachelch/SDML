A Note On Intrinsic Regularization Method
</title>

<abstract>
  There exist certain intrinsic relations between the ultraviolet divergent
graphs and the convergent ones at the same loop order in renormalizable quantum
field theories. Whereupon we may establish a new method, the intrinsic
regularization method, to regulate those divergent graphs. In this note, we
present a proposal, the inserter proposal, to the method. The $\phi^4$ theory
and QED at the one loop order are dealt with in some detail. Inserters in the
standard model are given. Some applications to SUSY-models are also made at the
one loop order.
