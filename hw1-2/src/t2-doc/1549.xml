Dp Branes in PP-wave Background
</title>

<abstract>
  Dirichlet p-branes in the background of pp waves are constructed using the
massive Green-Schwarz worldsheet action for open strings. These branes are
localized at the origin and only for $p=7, 5, 3$ preserve half the
supersymmetries. The spectrum of the brane theory is analyzed and is found to
be in agreement with the spectrum of the small fluctuations of the world-volume
super Yang-Mills theory in this background. These branes are expected to
correspond to objects that are nonperturbative in $N$ in the dual gauge theory.
