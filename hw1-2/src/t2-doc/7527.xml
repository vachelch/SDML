The Quantum Group Structure of 2D Gravity and Minimal Models II: The
  Genus-Zero Chiral Bootstrap

<abstract>
  The F and B matrices associated with Virasoro null vectors are derived in
closed form by making use of the operator-approach suggested by the Liouville
theory, where the quantum-group symmetry is explicit.  It is found that the
entries of the fusing and braiding matrices are not simply equal to
quantum-group symbols, but involve additional coupling constants whose
derivation is one aim of the present work. Our explicit formulae are new, to
our knowledge, in spite of the numerous studies of this problem.  The
relationship between the quantum-group-invariant (of IRF type) and
quantum-group-covariant (of vertex type) chiral operator-algebras is fully
clarified, and connected with the transition to the shadow world for
quantum-group symbols. The corresponding 3-j-symbol dressing is shown to reduce
to the simpler transformation of Babelon and one of the author (J.-L. G.)  in a
suitable infinite limit defined by analytic continuation.  The above two types
of operators are found to coincide when applied to states with Liouville
momenta going to $\infty$ in a suitable way.  The introduction of
quantum-group-covariant operators in the three dimensional picture gives a
generalisation of the quantum-group version of discrete three-dimensional
gravity that includes tetrahedra associated with 3-j symbols and universal
R-matrix elements. Altogether the present work gives the concrete realization
of Moore and Seiberg's scheme that describes the chiral operator-algebra of
two-dimensional gravity and minimal models.
