Novel Local CFT and Exact Results on Perturbations of N=4 Super Yang
  Mills from AdS Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We find new, local, non-supersymmetric conformal field theories obtained by
relevant deformations of the N=4 super Yang Mills theory in the large $N$
limit. We contruct interpolating supergravity solutions that naturally
represent the flow from the N=4 super Yang Mills UV theory to these
non-supersymmetric IR fixed points. We also study the linearization around the
N=4 superconformal point of N=1 supersymmetric, marginal deformations. We show
that they give rise to N=1 superconformal fixed points, as expected from
field-theoretical arguments.
