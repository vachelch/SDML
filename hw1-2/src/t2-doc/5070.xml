Dilaton Tadpoles, Warped Geometries and Large Extra Dimensions for
  Non-Supersymmetric Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the backreaction of dilaton tadpoles on the geometry of
non-supersymmetric strings. After finding explicit warped solutions for a
T-dual version of the Sugimoto model, we examine the possibility of realizing
large extra dimension scenarios within the context of non-supersymmetric string
models. Our analysis reveals an appealing mechanism to dynamically reduce the
number of flat, non-compact directions in non-supersymmetric string theories.
