Non-Commutative Differential Geometry and Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We incorporate Sogami's idea in the standard model into our previous
formulation of non-commutative differential geometry by extending the action of
the extra exterior derivative operator on spinors defined over the discrete
space-time; four dimensinal Minkovski space multiplyed by two point discrete
space. The extension consists in making it possible to require that the
operator become nilpotent when acting on the spinors. It is shown that the
generalized field strength leads to the most general, gauge-invariant
Yang-Mills-Higgs Lagrangian even if the extra exterior derivative operator is
not nilpotent, while the fermionic part remains intact. The proof is given for
a single Higgs model. The method is applied to reformulate the standard model
by putting left-handed fermion doublets on the upper sheet and right-handed
fermion singlets on the lower sheet with generation mixing among quarks being
taken into account. We also present a matrix calculus of the method without
referring to the discrete space-time.
