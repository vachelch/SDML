Macroscopic $n$-Loop Amplitude for Minimal Models Coupled to
  Two-Dimensional Gravity: Fusion Rules and Interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the structure of the macroscopic $n$-loop amplitude obtained
from the two-matrix model at the unitary minimal critical point $(m+1,m)$. We
derive a general formula for the $n$-resolvent correlator at the continuum
planar limit whose inverse Laplace transform provides the amplitude in terms of
the boundary lengths $\ell_{i}$ and the renormalized cosmological constant $t$.
The amplitude is found to contain a term consisting of $\left( \frac{\partial}
{\partial t} \right)^{n-3}$ multiplied by the product of modified Bessel
functions summed over their degrees which conform to the fusion rules and the
crossing symmetry. This is found to be supplemented by an increasing number of
other terms with $n$ which represent residual interactions of loops. We reveal
the nature of these interactions by explicitly determining them as the
convolution of modified Bessel functions and their derivatives for the case
$n=4$ and the case $n=5$. We derive a set of recursion relations which relate
the terms in the $n$-resolvents to those in the $(n-1)$-resolvents.
