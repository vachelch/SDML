IIB Matrix Model with D1-D5 Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider IIB matrix model with D1-D5-brane backgrounds. Using the fact
that noncommutative gauge theory on the D-branes can be obtained as twisted
reduced model in IIB matrix model, we study two-dimensional gauge theory on
D1-branes and D5-branes. Especially the spectrum of the zero modes in the
off-diagonal parts is examined. We also consider the description of D1-branes
as local excitations of gauge theory on D5-branes. Relation to supergravity
solution is also discussed.
