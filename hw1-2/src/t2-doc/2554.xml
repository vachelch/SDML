On the stability of renormalizable expansions in three-dimensional
  gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Preliminary investigations are made for the stability of the $1/N$ expansion
in three-dimensional gravity coupled to various matter fields, which are
power-counting renormalizable. For unitary matters, a tachyonic pole appears in
the spin-2 part of the leading graviton propagator, which implies the unstable
flat space-time, unless the higher-derivative terms are introduced. As another
possibility to avoid this spin-2 tachyon, we propose Einstein gravity coupled
to non-unitary matters. It turns out that a tachyon appears in the spin-0 or -1
part for any linear gauges in this case, but it can be removed if non-minimally
coupled scalars are included. We suggest an interesting model which may be
stable and possess an ultraviolet fixed point.
