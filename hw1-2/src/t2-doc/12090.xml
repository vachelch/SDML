Dyons, K-theory and M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the dyonic charge of type IIA D6-branes interpreted as M-theory
Kaluza-Klein monopoles. The connection between the dyonic properties of type
IIA D6-branes and the existence of eleven dimensions is discussed. We also
study dyonic properties of non-commutative monopoles. Variations of the
external antisymmetric B-field generate the electric charge of non-commutative
dyons.
