Do anyons solve Heisenberg's Urgleichung in one dimension

  We construct solutions to the chiral Thirring model in the framework of
algebraic quantum field theory. We find that for all positive temperatures
there are fermionic solutions only if the coupling constant is $\lambda =
\sqrt{2(2n + 1)\pi}, n \in \bf N$.
