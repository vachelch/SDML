Solitons and Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the relationship between black holes in Jackiw-Teitelboim(JT)
dilaton gravity and solitons in sine-Gordon field theory. Our analysis expands
on the well known connection between solutions of the sine-Gordon equation and
constant curvature metrics. In particular, we show that solutions to the
dilaton field equations for a given metric in JT theory also solve the
sine-Gordon equation linearized about the corresponding soliton. Since the
dilaton generates Killing vectors of the constant curvature metric, it is
interesting that it has an analoguous interpretation in terms of symmetries of
the soliton solution. We also show that from the B${\ddot a}$cklund
transformations relating different soliton solutions, it is possible to
construct a flat SL(2,R) connection which forms the basis for the gauge theory
formulation of JT dilaton gravity.
