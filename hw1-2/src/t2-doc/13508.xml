Superstrings with new supersymmetry in (9,2) and (10,2) dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct superstring theories that obey the new supersymmetry algebra
{Q_a , Q_b}=\gamma_{ab}^{mn} P_{1m} P_{2n}, in a Green-Schwarz formalism, with
kappa supersymmetry also of the new type. The superstring is in a system with a
superparticle so that their total momenta are $P_{2n},P_{1m}$ respectively. The
system is covariant and critical in (10,2) dimensions if the particle is
massless and in (9,2) dimensions if the particle is massive. Both the
superstring and superparticle have coordinates with two timelike dimensions but
each behaves effectively as if they have a single timelike dimension. This is
due to gauge symmetries and associated constraints. We show how to generalize
the gauge principle to more intricate systems containing two parts, 1 and 2.
Each part contains interacting constituents, such as p-branes, and each part
behaves effectively as if they have one timelike coordinate, although the full
system has two timelike coordinates. The examples of two superparticles, and of
a superparticle and a superstring, discussed in more detail are a special cases
of such a generalized interacting system.
