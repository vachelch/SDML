Field-antifield formalism in a non-Abelian theory with one and two form
  gauge fields coupled in a topological way
</title>

<abstract>
  We make a systematic development of the non-Abelian formulation of two-form
gauge fields with topological coupling with the Yang-Mills one-form connection.
An analysis of the gauge structure, reducibility conditions and physical
degrees of freedom is presented. We employ the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism to
quantize the resulting theory.
