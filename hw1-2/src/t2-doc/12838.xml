Diffeomorphisms Versus Non Abelian Gauge Transformations: An Example of
  1+1 Dimensional Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the phase space of a typical model of 1+1 dimensional gravity
(Jackiw-Teitelboim model with cylindrical topology) using its reformulation as
a non abelian gauge theory based on the sl(2,R) algebra. Modifying the
conventional approach we argue that one should take the universal covering of
SL(2,R) rather than PSL(2,R) as the gauge group of the theory. We discuss the
consequences for the quantization of the model and find that the spectrum of
the Dirac observables is sensible to this modification. Our analysis further
provides an example for a gravity theory where the standard Hamiltonian
formulation identifies gravitationally inequivalent solutions.
