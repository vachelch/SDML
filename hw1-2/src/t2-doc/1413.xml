On D-branes from Gauged Linear Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study both A-type and B-type D-branes in the gauged linear sigma model by
considering worldsheets with boundary. The boundary conditions on the matter
and vector multiplet fields are first considered in the large-volume
phase/non-linear sigma model limit of the corresponding Calabi-Yau manifold,
where we also find that we need to add a contact term on the boundary. These
considerations enable to us to derive the boundary conditions in the full
gauged linear sigma model, including the addition of the appropriate boundary
contact terms, such that these boundary conditions have the correct non-linear
sigma model limit. Most of the analysis is for the case of Calabi-Yau manifolds
with one Kahler modulus (including those corresponding to hypersurfaces in
weighted projective space), though we comment on possible generalizations.
