Polynomials for Torus Links from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Invariant polynomials for torus links are obtained in the framework of the
Chern-Simons topological gauge theory. The polynomials are computed as vacuum
expectation values on the three-sphere of Wilson line operators representing
the Verlinde algebra of the corresponding rational conformal field theory. In
the case of the $SU(2)$ gauge theory our results provide explicit expressions
for the Jones polynomial as well as for the polynomials associated to the
$N$-state ($N>2$) vertex models (Akutsu-Wadati polynomials). By means of the
Chern-Simons coset construction, the minimal unitary models are analyzed,
showing that the corresponding link invariants factorize into two $SU(2)$
polynomials. A method to obtain skein rules from the Chern-Simons knot
operators is developed. This procedure yields the eigenvalues of the braiding
matrix of the corresponding conformal field theory.
