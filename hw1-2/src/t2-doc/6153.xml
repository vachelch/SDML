Extended Self-Dual Configurations as Stable Exact Solutions in
  Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of exact solutions to the Born-Infeld field equations, over manifolds
of any even dimension, is constructed. They are an extension of the self-dual
configurations. They are local minima of the action for riemannian base
manifolds and local minima of the Hamiltonian for pseudo-riemannian ones. A
general explicit expression for the Born-Infeld determinant is obtained, for
any dimension of space-time.
