Liouville theory, accessory parameters and 2+1 dimensional gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove a relation between the asymptotic behavior of the conformal factor
and the accessory parameters of the SU(1,1) Riemann- Hilbert problem. Such a
relation shows the hamiltonian nature of the dynamics of N particles coupled to
2+1 dimensional gravity. A generalization of such a result is used to prove a
connection between the regularized Liouville action and the accessory
parameters in presence of general elliptic singularities. This relation had
been conjectured by Polyakov in connection with 2-dimensional quantum gravity.
An alternative proof, which works also in presence of parabolic singularities,
is given by rewriting the regularized Liouville action in term of a background
field.
