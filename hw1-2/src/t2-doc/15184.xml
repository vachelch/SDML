On Asymmetric Orbifolds and the D=5 No-modulus Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine whether any type II asymmetric orbifolds have the same massless
spectrum as the dimensional reduction of D=5 simple supergravity, which,
besides the eleven-dimensional supergravity, is the only known supergravity
above four dimensions with no moduli. We attempt to construct such models by
further twisting the orbifolds which yield D=4, N=4 pure supergravity to find
that, unfortunately, none of the models have that spectrum. We provide
supergravity arguments explaining why this is so. As a by-product, we list all
possible momentum-winding lattices that give D=4, N=4 pure supergravity.
