Unitarity of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connection and the Bethe
  Ansatz for the elliptic Hitchin systems

  We work out finite-dimensional integral formulae for the scalar product of
genus one states of the group $G$ Chern-Simons theory with insertions of Wilson
lines. Assuming convergence of the integrals, we show that unitarity of the
elliptic Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connection with respect to the scalar
product of CS states is closely related to the Bethe Ansatz for the commuting
Hamiltonians building up the connection and quantizing the quadratic
Hamiltonians of the elliptic Hitchin system.
