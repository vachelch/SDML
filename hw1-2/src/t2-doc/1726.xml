High Energy Behavior of Wilson Lines
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the high energy behavior of the correlation functions of the
open Wilson lines in noncommutative gauge theory. We obtain a very simple
physical picture that they are bound to form a group of closed Wilson loops. We
prove our claim in the weak coupling region by perturbative analysis. We
emphasize the importance of respecting the cyclic symmetry of the straight
Wilson lines to compute the correlation functions. The implications for stringy
calculation of the correlators are also discussed.
