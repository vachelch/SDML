Mirror symmetry and Exact Solution of 4D N=2 Gauge Theories I
</title>

<abstract>
  Using geometric engineering in the context of type II strings, we obtain
exact solutions for the moduli space of the Coulomb branch of all N=2 gauge
theories in four dimensions involving products of SU gauge groups with
arbitrary number of bi-fundamental matter for chosen pairs, as well as an
arbitrary number of fundamental matter for each factor. Asymptotic freedom
restricts the possibilities to SU groups with bi-fundamental matter chosen
according to ADE or affine ADE Dynkin diagrams. Many of the results can be
derived in an elementary way using the self-mirror property of K3. We find that
in certain cases the solution of the Coulomb branch for N=2 gauge theories is
given in terms of a three dimensional complex manifold rather than a Riemann
surface. We also study new stringy strong coupling fixed points arising from
the compactification of higher dimensional theories with tensionless strings
and consider applications to three dimensional N=4 theories.
