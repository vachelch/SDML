Virasoro amplitude from the $S^N\R^{24}$ orbifold sigma model
</title>

<abstract>
  Four tachyon scattering amplitude is derived from the $S^N\R^{24}$ orbifold
sigma model in the large $N$ limit. The closed string interaction is described
by a vertex which is a bosonic analog of the supersymmetric one, recently
proposed by Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde.
