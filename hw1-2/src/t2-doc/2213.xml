On the effective action of local composite fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The gauge invariant method for calculation of the effective action of the
local composite fields in QFT is proposed. The effective action of the local
composite fields in QED is studied up to 2-loop level. The graph rules for the
local composite fields are derived. On the basis of these rules the problem of
one-particle irreducibility is discussed.
