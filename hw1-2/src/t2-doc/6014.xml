Ginsparg-Wilson Relation, Topological Invariants and Finite
  Noncommutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Ginsparg-Wilson (GW) relation can play an important role to
define chiral structures in {\it finite} noncommutative geometries. Employing
GW relation, we can prove the index theorem and construct topological
invariants even if the system has only finite degrees of freedom. As an
example, we consider a gauge theory on a fuzzy two-sphere and give an explicit
construction of a noncommutative analog of the GW relation, chirality operator
and the index theorem. The topological invariant is shown to coincide with the
1st Chern class in the commutative limit.
