Yangian-invariant field theory of matrix-vector models
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend our study of the field-theoretic description of matrix-vector
models and the associated many-body problems of one dimensional particles with
spin. We construct their Yangian-su(R) invariant Hamiltonian. It describes an
interacting theory of a c=1 collective boson and a k=1 su(R) current algebra.
When $R \geq 3$ cubic-current terms arise. Their coupling is determined by the
requirement of the Yangian symmetry. The Hamiltonian can be consistently
reduced to finite-dimensional subspaces of states, enabling an explicit
computation of the spectrum which we illustrate in the simplest case.
