Parity Transformation in the Front Form
</title>

<abstract>
  By considering the parity-transformation properties of the $(1/2,\,0)$ and
$(0,\,1/2)$ fields in the {\it front form} we find ourselves forced to study
the front-form evolution both along $x^+$ and $x^-$ directions. As a by
product, we find that half of the dynamical degrees of freedom of a full theory
live on the $x^+=0$ surface and the other half on the $x^-=0$ surface.
Elsewhere, Jacob shows how these results are required to build a satisfactory,
and internally consistent, front-form quantum field theory.
