Gaussian Effective Potential and the Coleman's normal-ordering
  Prescription : the Functional Integral Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  For a class of system, the potential of whose Bosonic Hamiltonian has a
Fourier representation in the sense of tempered distributions, we calculate the
Gaussian effective potential within the framework of functional integral
formalism. We show that the Coleman's normal-ordering prescription can be
formally generalized to the functional integral formalism.
