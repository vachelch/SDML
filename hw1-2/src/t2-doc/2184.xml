The fate of the type I non-BPS D7-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the fate of the Type I non-BPS D7-brane, which is tachyonic but
carries a non-trivial K-theory $\IZ_2$ charge. It decays to topologically
non-trivial gauge field configurations on the background D9-branes. In the
uncompactified theory the decay proceeds to infinity, while with a transverse
torus the decay reaches a final state, a toron gauge configuration with
vanishing Chern classes but non-trivial $\IZ_2$ charge. A similar behaviour is
obtained for the type I non-BPS D8-brane, and other related systems. We
construct explicit examples of type IIB orientifolds with non-BPS D7-branes,
which are hence non-supersymmetric, but for which supersymmetry is restored
upon condensation of the tachyon. We also report on the interesting structure
of non-BPS states of type IIA theory in the presence of an O6-plane, their
M-theory lifts, the relation between string theory K-theory and M-theory
cohomology, and its interplay with NS-NS charged objects. We discuss several
new effects, including: i) transmutation between NS-NS and RR torsion charges,
ii) non-BPS states classified by K-theory but not by cohomology in string
theory, but whose lift to M-theory is cohomological.
