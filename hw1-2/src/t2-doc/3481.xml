Topology Change and theta-Vacua in 2D Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the existence of $\theta$-vacua in pure Yang-Mills theory in two
space-time dimensions. More precisely, a procedure is given which allows one to
classify the distinct quantum theories possessing the same classical limit for
an arbitrary connected gauge group G and compact space-time manifold M
(possibly with boundary) possessing a special basepoint. For any such G and
M it is shown that the above quantizations are in one-to-one correspondence
with the irreducible unitary representations (IUR's) of $\pi_1(G)$ if M is
orientable, and with the IUR's of $\pi_1(G)/2\pi_1(G)$ if M is nonorientable.
