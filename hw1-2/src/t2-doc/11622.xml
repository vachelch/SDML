Circular Semiclassical String solutions on Confining AdS/CFT Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study multiwrapped circular string pulsating in the radial direction of
AdS black hole. We compute the energy of this string as a function of a large
quantum number n. One then could associate it with energy and a quantum number
of states in the dual finite temperature {\cal N}=4 SYM theory as well as three
dimensional pure gauge theory. We observe that the n dependence of the energy
has a universal form. We have also considered pulsating string in the
background of the near-extremal D4-brane solution. Circular pulsating membrane
in M-theory on AdS_7\times S^4 has also been studied.
