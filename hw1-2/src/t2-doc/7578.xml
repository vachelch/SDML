Derivation of Index Theorems by Localization of Path Integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the derivation of the Atiyah-Singer and Callias index theorems
using the recently developed localization method to calculate exactly the
relevant supersymmetric path integrals. (Talk given at the III International
Conference on Mathematical Physics, String Theory and Quantum Gravity, Alushta,
Ukraine, June 13-24, 1993)
