Space-Time Foam Effects on Particle Interactions and the GZK Cutoff
</title>

<abstract>
  Modelling space-time foam using a non-critical Liouville-string model for the
quantum fluctuations of D branes with recoil, we discuss the issues of momentum
and energy conservation in particle propagation and interactions. We argue that
momentum should be conserved exactly during propagation and on the average
during interactions, but that energy is conserved only on the average during
propagation and is in general not conserved during particle interactions,
because of changes in the background metric. We discuss the possible
modification of the GZK cutoff on high-energy cosmic rays, in the light of this
energy non-conservation as well as the possible modification of the usual
relativistic momentum-energy relation.
