The Second Virial Coefficient of Spin-1/2 Anyon Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the second virial coefficient of spin-1/2 anyon gas in the
various values of the self-adjoint extension parameter by incorporating the
self-adjoint extension method into the Green's function formalism. Especially,
the completely different cusp- and discontinuity-structures from the result of
previous literature are obtained when the self-adjoint extension parameter goes
to infinity. This is originated from the different condition for the occurrence
of irregular states.
