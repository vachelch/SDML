Thick Domain Walls and Charged Dilaton Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a black hole domain wall system in dilaton gravity which is the
low-energy limit of the superstring theory. We solve numerically equations of
motion for real self-interacting scalar field and justify the existence of
static axisymmetric field configuration representing the thick domain wall in
the background of a charged dilaton black hole. It was also confirmed that the
extreme dilaton black hole always expelled the domain wall.
