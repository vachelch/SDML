Near-extremal correlators and vanishing supergravity couplings in
  AdS/CFT
</title>

<abstract>
  We study near-extremal n-point correlation functions of chiral primary
operators, in which the maximal scale dimension k is related to the others by
k=\sum_i k_i-m with m equal to or smaller than n-3. Through order g^2 in field
theory, we show that these correlators are simple sums of terms each of which
factors into products of lower-point correlators. Terms which contain only
factors of two- and three-point functions are not renormalized, but other terms
have non-vanishing order g^2 corrections.
  We then show that the contributing AdS exchange diagrams neatly match this
factored structure. In particular, for n=4,5 precise agreement in form and
coefficient is established between supergravity and the non-renormalized
factored terms from field theory. On the other hand, contact diagrams in
supergravity would produce a non-factored structure. This leads us to
conjecture that the corresponding bulk couplings vanish, so as to achieve full
agreement between the structure of these correlators in supergravity and
weak-coupling field theory.
