Anyonic Construction of the $SL_{Q,s}(2)$ Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  Considering anyonic oscillators in a two-dimensional lattice, we realize the
quantum semi-group $sl_{(q,s)}(2)$ by means of a generalized Schwinger
construction. We find that the parameter $q$ of the algebra is connected to the
statistical parameter, whereas the $s$ parameter is related to a $s$-deformed
oscillator introduced at each point of the lattice.
