Classification of Quantum Hall Universality Classes by $\ W_{1+\infty}\
  $ symmetry
</title>

  We show how two-dimensional incompressible quantum fluids and their
excitations can be viewed as $\ W_{1+\infty}\ $ edge conformal field theories,
thereby providing an algebraic characterization of incompressibility. The
Kac-Radul representation theory of the $\ W_{1+\infty}\ $ algebra leads then to
a purely algebraic complete classification of hierarchical quantum Hall states,
which encompasses all measured fractions. Spin-polarized electrons in
single-layer devices can only have Abelian anyon excitations.
