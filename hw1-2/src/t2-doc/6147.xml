Geometrical particle models on 3D null curves
</title>

<abstract>
  The simplest (2+1)-dimensional mechanical systems associated with light-like
curves, already studied by Nersessian and Ramos, are reconsidered. The action
is linear in the curvature of the particle path and the moduli spaces of
solutions are completely exhibited in 3-dimensional Minkowski background, even
when the action is not proportional to the pseudo-arc length of the trajectory.
