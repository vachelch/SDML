A Solvable Model for Intersecting Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that some models with non-local (and non-localizable) interactions
have a property, called quasi-locality, which allows for the definition of a
transfer matrix. We give the Yang-Baxter equation as a sufficient condition for
the existence of a family of commuting transfer matrices and solve them for a
loop model with intersections. This solvable model is then analyzed in some
detail and its applications to a Lorentz gas are briefly discussed.
