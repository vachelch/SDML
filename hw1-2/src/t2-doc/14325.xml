A Note on Orientifolds and Dualities of Type 0B String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the construction of four dimensional non-tachyonic orientifolds
of type 0B string theory to non-supersymmetric backgrounds. We construct a four
dimensional model containing self-dual D3 and D9-branes and leading to a chiral
anomaly-free massless spectrum. Moreover, we discuss a further tachyon-free six
dimensional model with only D5 branes. Eventually, we speculate about strong
coupling dual models of the ten-dimensional orientifolds of type 0B.
