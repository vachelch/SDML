Linearisation of Universal Field Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The Universal Field Equations, recently constructed as examples of higher
dimensional dynamical systems which admit an infinity of inequivalent
Lagrangians are shown to be linearised by a Legendre transformation. This
establishes the conjecture that these equations describe integrable systems.
While this construction is implicit in general, there exists a large class of
solutions for which an explicit form may be written.
