Gauge Invariant Pauli-Villars Regularization of Chiral Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the idea of the generalized Pauli-Villars regularization of Frolov
and Slavnov and analyze the general structure of the regularization scheme. The
gauge anomaly-free condition emerges in a simple way in the scheme, and, under
the standard prescription for the momentum assignment, the Pauli-Villars
Lagrangian provides a gauge invariant regularization of chiral fermions in
arbitrary anomaly-free representations. The vacuum polarization tensor is
transverse, and the fermion number and the conformal anomalies have gauge
invariant forms. We also point out that the real representation can be treated
in a straightforward manner and the covariant regularization scheme is directly
implemented.
