Topological Membrane Solitons and Loop Orders of Membrane Scatterings in
  M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Two topological issues on membranes in M-theory are studied:
    (1) Soliton is an important subject in M-theory. Under the framework of
obstruction theory with the help from framed links in $S^3$, we give a complete
enumeration of topological membrane solitons in a string-admissible
target-space of the form a product of Minkowskian space-times, tori, and
K3-surfaces. Patching of these solitons and their topological charges are also
defined and discussed. 
    (2) Loop order of membrane scatterings is the basis for a perturbative
M-theory. We explore this concept with emphases on its distinct features from
pointlike and stringlike particles.
  For completeness, a light exposition on homologies of compact oriented
3-manifolds is given in the Appendix.
