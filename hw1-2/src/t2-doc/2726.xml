On The Construction of W(N)-Algebras In The Form Of A(N-1)-Casimir
  Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Casimir W-algebras are shown to exist in such a way that the conformal spins
of primary(generating) fields coincide with the orders of independent Casimir
operators. We show here that this coincidence can be extended further to the
case that these generating fields have the same eiginvalues with the Casimir
operators.
