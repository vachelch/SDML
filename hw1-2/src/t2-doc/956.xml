Solutions to Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations with coefficients in
  non-bounded modules
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly write dowm integral formulas for solutions to
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations with coefficients in non-bounded -- neither
highest nor lowest weight -- $\gtsl_{n+1}$-modules. The formulas are closely
related to WZNW model at a rational level.
