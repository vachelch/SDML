Real Borcherds Superalgebras and M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The correspondence between del Pezzo surfaces and field theory models over
the complex numbers or for split real forms is extended to other real forms, in
particular to those compatible with supersymmetry. Specifically, all theories
of the Magic triangle that reduce to the pure supergravities in four dimensions
correspond to singular real del Pezzo surfaces and the same is true for the
Magic square of ${\cal N}=2$ SUGRAS.
  A real del Pezzo surface is the invariant set under an antilinear involution
of a complex one. This conjugation induces an involution of the Picard group
that preserves the anticanonical class and the intersection form. The known
non-split U-duality algebras are embedded into superBorcherds algebras defined
by their Cartan matrix (minus the intersection form) and fixed by the
anti-involution. These data may be described by Tits-Satake bicoloured
diagrams.
  As in the split case, oxidation results from blowing down disjoint real $\RR
{\mathbb P}_1$'s of self-intersection -1. The singular del Pezzo surfaces of
interest are obtained by degenerating regular surfaces upon contraction of real
curves of self-intersection -2. We use the finite classification of real simple
singularities to exhibit the relevant normal surfaces. We also give a general
construction of more magic triangles like a type I split magic triangle and
prove their (approximate) symmetry with respect to their diagonal, this
symmetry argument was announced in our previous paper for the split case.
