C-theorem for two dimensional chiral theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss an extension of the $C$-theorem to chiral theories. We show that
two monotonically decreasing $C$-functions can be introduced. However, their
difference is a constant of the renormalization group flow. This constant
reproduces the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions.
