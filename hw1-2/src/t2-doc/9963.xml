Scaling Violation in O(N) Vector Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate $O(N)$-symmetric vector field theories in the double scaling
limit. Our model describes branched polymeric systems in $D$ dimensions, whose
multicritical series interpolates between the Cayley tree and the ordinary
random walk. We give explicit forms of residual divergences in the free energy,
analogous to those observed in the strings in one dimension.
