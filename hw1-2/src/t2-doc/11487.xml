The Field Theory of the q->4+ Potts Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The q-state Potts model in two dimensions exhibits a first-order transition
for q>4. As q->4+ the correlation length at this transition diverges. We argue
that this limit defines a massive integrable quantum field theory whose lowest
excitations are kinks connecting 4+1 degenerate ground states. We construct the
S-matrix of this theory and the two-particle form factors, and hence estimate a
number of universal amplitude ratios. These are in very good agreement with the
results of extrapolated series in q^(-1/2) as well as Monte Carlo results for
q=5.
