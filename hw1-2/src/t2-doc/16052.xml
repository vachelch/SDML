Noncommutative Scalar Solitons at Finite $\theta$
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the behavior of the noncommutative scalar soliton solutions at
finite noncommutative scale $\theta$. A detailed analysis of the equation of
the motion indicates that fewer and fewer soliton solutions exist as $\theta$
is decreased and thus the solitonic sector of the theory exhibits an overall
hierarchy structure. If the potential is bounded below, there is a finite
$\theta_c$ below which all the solitons cease to exist even though the
noncommutativity is still present. If the potential is not bounded below, for
any nonzero $\theta$ there is always a soliton solution, which becomes singular
only at $\theta = 0$. The $\phi^4$ potential is studied in detail and it is
found the critical $(\theta m^2)_c =13.92$ ($m^2$ is the coefficient of the
quadratic term in the potential) is universal for all the symmetric $\phi^4$
potential.
