On a Gauge Invariant Quantum Formulation for Non-gauge Classical Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a method of constructing a gauge invariant canonical formulation
for non-gauge classical theory which depends on a set of parameters.
Requirement of closure for algebra of operators generating quantum gauge
transformations leads to restrictions on parameters of the theory. This
approach is then applied for illustration to bosonic string theory coupled to
background tachyonic field. It is shown that within the proposed canonical
formulation the known mass-shell condition for tachyon is produced.
