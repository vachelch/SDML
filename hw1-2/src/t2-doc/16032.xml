Aspects of Duality and Confining Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We inspect the excitation energy spectrum of a confining string in terms of
solitons in an effective field theory model. The spectrum can be characterized
by a spectral function, and twisting and bending of the string is manifested by
the invariance of this function under a duality transformation. Both general
considerations and numerical simulations reveal that the spectral function can
be approximated by a simple rational form, which we propose becomes exact in
the Yang-Mills theory.
