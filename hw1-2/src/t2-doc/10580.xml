Ghost decoupling in 't Hooft spectrum for mesons
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the replacement of the ``instantaneous'' 't Hooft's potential
with the causal form suggested by equal time canonical quantization in
light-cone gauge, which entails the occurrence of negative probability states,
does not change the bound state spectrum when the difference is treated as a
single insertion in the kernel.
