Representations of the compact quantum group $SU_q(N)$ and geometrical
  quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  The method of geometrical quantization of symplectic manifolds is applied to
constructing infinite dimensional irreducible unitary representations of the
algebra of functions on the compact quantum group $SU_q(2)$. A formulation of
the method for the general case $SU_q(n)$ is suggested. (This work is the
English version of the article submitted for publication in Algebra Analiz.)
