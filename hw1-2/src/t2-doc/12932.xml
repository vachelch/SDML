Quasi Exactly Solvable 2$\times$2 Matrix Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the conditions under which systems of two differential
eigenvalue equations are quasi exactly solvable. These systems reveal a rich
set of algebraic structures. Some of them are explicitely described. An exemple
of quasi exactly system is studied which provides a direct counterpart of the
Lam\'e equation.
