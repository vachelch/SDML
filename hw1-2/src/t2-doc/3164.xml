Chiral Symmetry in Supersymmetric Three Dimensional Quantum

<abstract>
  We describe the investigation of spontaneous mass-generation and chiral
symmetry breaking in supersymmetric QED3 using numerical solutions of the
Dyson-Schwinger equation together with the CJT effective action and
supersymmetric Ward identities. We find that, within the quenched bare
approximation, the chirally symmetric solution is favoured.
