Branes in Special Holonomy Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the flow from the theory of D2-branes in a G2 holonomy background to
M2-branes in a Spin(7) holonomy background. We consider in detail the UV and IR
regimes, and the effect of topology change of the background on the field
theory. We conjecture a non-Abelian N=1 mirror symmetry.
