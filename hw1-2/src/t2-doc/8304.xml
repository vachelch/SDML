Nonabelian Berry Phase, Yang-Mills Instanton and USp(2k) Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The nonabelian Berry phase is computed in the T dualized quantum mechanics
obtained from the USp(2k) matrix model. Integrating the fermions, we find that
each of the spacetime points X_{\nu}^{(i)} is equipped with a pair of su(2) Lie
algebra valued pointlike singularities located at a distance m_{(f)} from the
orientifold surface. On a four dimensional paraboloid embedded in the five
dimensional Euclidean space, these singularities are recognized as the BPST
instantons.
