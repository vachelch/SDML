  supersymmetric black hole entropy

<abstract>
  We present subleading corrections to the N=2 supersymmetric black hole
entropy. These subleading contributions correspond to instanton corrections of
the Type II string theory. In particular we consider an axion free black hole
solution of low-energy effective Type II string theory. We present a procedure
to include successively all instanton corrections. Expanding these corrections
at particular points in moduli space yields polynomial and logarithmic
instanton corrections to the classical black hole entropy. We comment on a
microscopic interpretation of these instanton corrections and find that the
logarithmic corrections correspond to subleading terms in the degeneracy of the
spectrum of an underlying quantum theory.
