Gauge Theory of Relativistic Membranes
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we show that a relativistic membrane admits an equivalent
representation in terms of the Kalb-Ramond gauge field
$F_{\mu\nu\rho}=\partial_{\,[\,\mu}B_{\nu\rho]}$ encountered in string theory.
By `` equivalence '' we mean the following: if $x=X(\xi)$ is a solution of the
classical equations of motion derived from the Dirac-Nambu-Goto action, then it
is always possible to find a differential form of {\it rank three}, satisfying
Maxwell-type equations. The converse proposition is also true. In the first
part of the paper, we show that a relativistic membrane, regarded as a
mechanical system, admits a Hamilton-Jacobi formulation in which the H-J
function describing a family of classical membrane histories is given by
$\displaystyle{F=dB=dS^1\wedge dS^2\wedge dS^3}$. In the second part of the
paper, we introduce a {\it new} lagrangian of the Kalb-Ramond type which
provides a {\it first order} formulation for both open and closed membranes.
Finally, for completeness, we show that such a correspondence can be
established in the very general case of a p-brane coupled to gravity in a
spacetime of arbitrary dimensionality.
