Hopf Algebra Primitives and Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  The analysis of the combinatorics resulting from the perturbative expansion
of the transition amplitude in quantum field theories, and the relation of this
expansion to the Hausdorff series leads naturally to consider an infinite
dimensional Lie subalgebra and the corresponding enveloping Hopf algebra, to
which the elements of this series are associated. We show that in the context
of these structures the power sum symmetric functionals of the perturbative
expansion are Hopf primitives and that they are given by linear combinations of
Hall polynomials, or diagrammatically by Hall trees. We show that each Hall
tree corresponds to sums of Feynman diagrams each with the same number of
vertices, external legs and loops.
 In addition, since the Lie subalgebra admits a derivation endomorphism, we
also show that with respect to it these primitives are cyclic vectors generated
by the free propagator, and thus provide a recursion relation by means of which
the (n+1)-vertex connected Green functions can be derived systematically from
the n-vertex ones. By the application of an algebra homomorphism to these
primitives and the use of the Connes-Kreimer twisted antipode axiom together
with the Birkhoff algebraic decomposition, we investigate their relevance to
the renormalization process and arrive in a rather straightforward and
heuristic manner at the basic equation of renormalization theory from which the
explicit relations between the bare and physical parameters of the theory may
be derived, and from which the corresponding renormalized Green functions, as
well as the Renormalization Group equations in the Mass Independent
Renormalization Scheme result.
