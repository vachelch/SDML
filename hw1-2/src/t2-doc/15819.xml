Singular Yukawa and gauge couplings in d=4 Heterotic String Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we discuss the singularities in the Yukawa and gauge couplings
of N=1 compactifications of the SO(32) heterotic string in four space-time
dimensions. Such singularities can arise from the strong coupling dynamics of a
confined non-perturbative gauge group.
