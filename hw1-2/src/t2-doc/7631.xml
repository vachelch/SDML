U(1)xSU(m)_1 Theory and c=m W_{1+\infty} Minimal Models in the
  Hierarchical Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  Two classes of Conformal Field Theories have been proposed to describe the
Hierarchical Quantum Hall Effect:the multi-component bosonic theory,
characterized by the symmetry U(1)xSU(m)_1 and the W_{1+\infty} minimal models
with central charge c=m. In spite of having the same spectrum of edge
excitations, they manifest differences in the degeneracy of the states and in
the quantum statistics, which call for a more detailed comparison between them.
Here, we describe their detailed relation for the general case, c=m and extend
the methods previously published for c < 4. Specifically, we obtain the
reduction in the number of degrees of freedom from the multi-component Abelian
theory to the minimal models by decomposing the characters of the U(1)xSU(m)_1
representations into those of the c=m W_{1+\infty} minimal models. Furthermore,
we find the Hamiltonian whose renormalization group flow interpolates between
the two models, having the W_{1+\infty} minimal models as infra-red fixed
point.
