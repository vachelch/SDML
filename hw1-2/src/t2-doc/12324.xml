Scattering From a Two Dimensional Array of Flux Tubes: A Study of The
  Validity of Mean Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Mean Field Theory has been extensively used in the study of systems of anyons
in two spatial dimensions. In this paper we study the physical grounds for the
validity of this approximation by considering the Quantum Mechanical scattering
of a charged particle from a two dimensional array of magnetic flux tubes. The
flux tubes are arranged on a regular lattice which is infinitely long in the
``$y$'' direction but which has a (small) finite number of columns in the
``$x$'' direction. Their physical size is assumed to be infinitesimally small.
We develop a method for computing the scattering angle as well as the
reflection and transmission coefficients to lowest order in the Aharonov--Bohm
interaction. The results of our calculation are compared to the scattering of
the same particle from a region of constant magnetic field whose magnitude is
equal to the mean field of all the flux tubes. For an incident plane wave, the
Mean Field approximation is shown to be valid provided the flux in each tube is
much less than a single flux quantum. This is precisely the regime in which
Mean Field Theory for anyons is expected to be valid. When the flux per tube
becomes of order 1, Mean Field Theory is no longer valid.
