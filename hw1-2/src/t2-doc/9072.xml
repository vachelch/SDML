The massless gravitino and the AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the massless gravitino on
$AdS_{d+1}$ space and compute the two-point function of the dual CFT
supersymmetry currents using the $AdS$/CFT correspondence principle. We find
analogously to the spinor case that the boundary data for the massless $(d+1)$
dimensional bulk gravitino field consists of only a $(d-1)$ dimensional
gravitino.
