On the Class of Possible Nonlocal Anyon-Like Operators and Quantum
  Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We find a class of nonlocal operators constructed by attaching a disorder
operator to fermionic degrees of freedom, which can be used to generate
q-deformed algebras following the Schwinger approach. This class includes the
recently proposed anyonic operators defined on a lattice.
