A New Massive Type IIA Supergravity From Compactification
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the most general form for eleven dimensional supersymmetry
compatible with on-shell superfields. This allows for the introduction of a
conformal Spin(1,10) connection. In eleven dimensional Minkowski space this
modification is trivial and can be removed by a field redefinition, however,
upon compactification on S^1 it is possible to introduce a non-trivial `Wilson
line'. The resulting ten dimensional supergravity has massive 1-form and 3-form
potentials and a cosmological constant. This theory does not possess a
supersymmetric eightbrane soliton but it does admit a supersymmetric non-static
cosmological solution.
