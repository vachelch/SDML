Gauge-Invariant Operators for Singular Knots in Chern-Simons Gauge
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct gauge invariant operators for singular knots in the context of
Chern-Simons gauge theory. These new operators provide polynomial invariants
and Vassiliev invariants for singular knots. As an application we present the
form of the Kontsevich integral for the case of singular knots.
