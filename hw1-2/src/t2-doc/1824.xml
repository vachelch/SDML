Supersymmetry in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We study how local symmetry transformations of (p, q) anti de Sitter
supergravities in three dimensions act on fields on the two-dimensional
boundary. The boundary transformation laws are shown to be the same as those of
two-dimensional (p, q) conformal supergravities for p, q \leq 2. Weyl and super
Weyl transformations are generated from three-dimensional general coordinate
and super transformations.
