Penrose Limit and String Theories on Various Brane Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the Penrose limit of various brane solutions including
Dp-branes, NS5-branes, fundamental strings, (p,q) fivebranes and (p,q) strings.
We obtain special null geodesics with the fixed radial coordinate (critical
radius), along which the Penrose limit gives string theories with constant
mass. We also study string theories with time-dependent mass, which arise from
the Penrose limit of the brane backgrounds. We examine equations of motion of
the strings in the asymptotic flat region and around the critical radius. In
particular, for (p,q) fivebranes, we find that the string equations of motion
in the directions with the B field are explicitly solved by the spheroidal wave
functions.
