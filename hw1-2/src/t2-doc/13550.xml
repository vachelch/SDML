Monopoles and Dyons in Non-Commutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  Taking advantage of the equivalence between supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
on non-commutative spaces and the field theory limit of D3-branes in the
background of NSNS 2-form field, we investigate the static properties of
magnetic monopoles and dyons using brane construction techniques. When parallel
D3-branes are separated by turning on a Higgs vacuum expectation value,
D-strings will stretch between them at an angle which depends on the value of
the background 2-form potential. These states preserve half of the
supersymmetries and have the same masses as their commutative counterparts in
the field theory limit. We also find stable (p,q)-dyons and string junctions.
We find that they do not preserve any supersymmetry but have the same masses as
their commutative counterparts. In the field theory limit, the (p,q)-dyons and
the string junctions restore 1/2 and 1/4 of the 16 supersymmetries,
respectively.
