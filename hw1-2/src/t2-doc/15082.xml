Soliton S matrices for the critical A_{N-1}^(1) chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute by Bethe Ansatz both bulk and boundary hole scattering matrices
for the critical A_{N-1}^(1) quantum spin chain. The bulk S matrix coincides
with the soliton S matrix for the A_{N-1}^(1) Toda field theory with imaginary
coupling. We verify our result for the boundary S matrix using a generalization
of the Ghoshal-Zamolodchikov boundary crossing relation.
