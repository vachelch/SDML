Duality and Exact Results in Product Group Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the non-perturbative behavior of some N=1 supersymmetric
product-group gauge theories with the help of duality. As a test case we
investigate an SU(2)xSU(2) theory in detail. Various dual theories are
constructed using known simple-group duality for one group or both groups in
succession. Several stringent tests show that the low-energy behavior of the
dual theories agrees with that of the electric theory. When the theory is in
the confining phase we calculate the exact superpotential. Our results strongly
suggest that, in general, dual theories for product groups can be constructed
in this manner, by using simple-group duality for both groups. Turning to a
class of theories with SU(N)xSU(M) gauge symmetry we study the renormalization
group flows in the space of the two gauge couplings and show that they are
consistent with the absence of phase transitions. Finally, we show that a
subset of these theories, with SU(N)xSU(N-1) symmetry break supersymmetry
dynamically.
