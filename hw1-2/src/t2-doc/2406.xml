Comment on ``Singularities in axially symmetric solutions of
  Einstein-Yang Mills and related theories, by Ludger Hannibal,
  [hep-th/9903063]''
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that the statements in [hep-th/9903063] concerning the
regularity of static axially symmetric solutions in Yang-Mills-dilaton (YMD)
[1] and Einstein-Yang-Mills(-dilaton) (EYMD) theory [2,3] are incorrect, and
that the non-singular local gauge potential of the YMD solutions [4] is twice
differentiable.
