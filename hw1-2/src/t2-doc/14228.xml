Anomalies and Wess-Zumino Terms in an Extended, Regularized
  Field-Antifield Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantization of anomalous gauge theories with closed, irreducible gauge
algebra within the extended Field-Antifield formalism is further pursued. Using
a Pauli-Villars (PV) regularization of the generating functional at one loop
level, an alternative form for the anomaly is found which involves only the
regulator. The analysis of this expression allows to conclude that recently
found ghost number one cocycles with nontrivial antifield dependence can not
appear in PV regularization. Afterwards, the extended Field-Antifield formalism
is further completed by incorporating quantum effects of the extra variables,
i.e., by explicitly taking into account the regularization of the extra sector.
In this context, invariant PV regulators are constructed from non-invariant
ones, leading to an alternative interpretation of the Wess-Zumino action as the
local counterterm relating invariant and non-invariant regularizations.
Finally, application of the above ideas to the bosonic string reproduces the
well-known Liouville action and the shift $(26-D)\rightarrow(25-D)$ at one
loop.
