Non-Abelian Solitons in N=4 Gauged Supergravity and Leading Order String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study static, spherically symmetric, and purely magnetic solutions of the
N=4 gauged supergravity in four dimensions. A systematic analysis of the
supersymmetry conditions reveals solutions which preserve 1/4 of the
supersymmetries and are characterized by a BPS-monopole-type gauge field and a
globally hyperbolic, everywhere regular geometry. We show that the theory in
which these solutions arise can be obtained via compactification of
ten-dimensional supergravity on the group manifold. This result is then used to
lift the solutions to ten dimensions.
