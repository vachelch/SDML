No van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov Discontinuity for Supergravity in AdS Space
</title>

<abstract>
  Adding explicit mass terms for the spin 2 and spin 3/2 field of N=1 anti-de
Sitter supergravity, the limit M --> 0 for these mass terms is smooth: there is
no van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov mass discontinuity in the propagators when the
cosmological constant is non-vanishing.
