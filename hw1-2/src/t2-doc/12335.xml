Probability Density, Diagrammatic Technique, and Epsilon Expansion in
  the Theory of Wave Turbulence
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the methods of Field Theory to study the turbulent regimes of
statistical systems. First we show how one can find their probability
densities. For the case of the theory of wave turbulence with four-wave
interaction we calculate them explicitly and study their properties. Using
those densities we show how one can in principle calculate any correlation
function in this theory by means of direct perturbative expansion in powers of
the interaction. Then we give the general form of the corrections to the
kinetic equation and develop an appropriate diagrammatic technique. This
technique, while resembling that of $\varphi^4$ theory, has many new
distinctive features. The role of the $\epsilon=d-4$ parameter is played here
by the parameter $\kappa=\beta + d - \alpha - \gamma$ where $\beta$ is the
dimension of the interaction, $d$ is the space dimension, $\alpha$ is the
dimension of the energy spectrum and $\gamma$ is the ``classical'' wave density
dimension. If $\kappa > 0$ then the Kolmogorov index is exact, and if $\kappa <
0$ then we expect it to be modified by the interaction. For $\kappa$ a small
negative number, $\alpha<1$ and a special form of the interaction we compute
this modification explicitly with the additional assumption of the irrelevance
of the IR divergencies which still needs to be verified.
