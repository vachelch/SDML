Dual gluons and monopoles in 2+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  2+1-dimensional Yang-Mills theory is reinterpreted in terms of metrics on
3-manifolds. The dual gluons are related to diffeomorphisms of the 3-manifold.
Monopoles are identified with points where the Ricci tensor has triply
degenerate eigenvalues. The dual gluons have the desired interaction with these
monopoles. This would give a mass for the dual gluons resulting in confinement.
