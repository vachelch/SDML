See-Saw Modification of Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a model in which the fundamental scale of gravity is restricted to
10^{-3} eV. An observable modification of gravity occurs simultaneously at the
Hubble distance and at around 0.1 mm. These predictions can be tested both by
the table-top experiments and by cosmological measurements. The model is
formulated as a brane-world theory embedded in a space with two or more
infinite-volume extra dimensions. Gravity on the brane reproduces the
four-dimensional laws at observable distances but turns to the high-dimensional
behavior at larger scales. To determine the crossover distance we smooth out
the singularities in the Green's functions by taking into account softening of
the graviton propagator due to the high-dimensional operators that are
suppressed by the fundamental scale. We find that irrespective of the precise
nature of microscopic gravity the ultraviolet and infrared scales of
gravity-modification are rigidly correlated. This fixes the fundamental scale
of gravity at 10^{-3} eV. The result persists for nonzero thickness branes.
