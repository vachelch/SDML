Analytical results for string propagation near a Kaluza-Klein black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  This brief report presents analytical solutions to the equations of motion of
a null string. The background spacetime is a magnetically charged Kaluza-Klein
black hole. The string coordinates are expanded with the world-sheet velocity
of light as an expansion parameter. It is shown that the zeroth order solutions
can be expressed in terms of elementary functions in an appropriate large
distance approximation. In addition, a class of exact solutions corresponding
to the Pollard-Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole case is also obtained.
