Chiral Splitting at Work
</title>

<abstract>
  Second-order equations of motion on a group manifold that appear in a large
class of so-called chiral theories are presented. These equations are presented
and explicitely solved for cases of semi-simple, finite-dimensional Lie groups.
With three figures avaliable from the authors upon request.
