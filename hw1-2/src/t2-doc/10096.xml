Heisenberg and Modular Invariance of N=2 Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a theta function representation of the twisted characters for the
rational N=2 superconformal field theory, and discuss the Jacobi-form like
functional properties of these characters for a fixed central charge under the
action of a finite Heisenberg group and modular transformations.
