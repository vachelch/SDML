N=1 Super Yang-Mills Theory in Ito Calculus
</title>

<abstract>
  Stochastic quantization method is applied to N = 1 super Yang-Mills theory
especially in 4 and 10 dimensions. In 4 dimensional case, based on the Ito
calculus, the Langevin equation is derived in the superfield formalism. The
stochastic process manifestly preserves both the local gauge symmetry and the
global N = 1 supersymmetry in the sense of Ito. The corresponding Fokker-Planck
equation reproduces the action of the superfield SYM_4 at the equilibrium
limit. The component expression of the superfield Langevin equation is
naturally extended to a Langevin equation for 10 dimensional case where the
spinor field is Majorana-Weyl. By taking a naive zero volume limit of SYM_10,
IIB matirx model is discussed in this context.
