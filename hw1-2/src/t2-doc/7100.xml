Duality transformation for 3+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Dual form of 3+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory is obtained as another SO(3)
gauge theory. Duality transformation is realized as a canonical transformation.
The The non-abelian Gauss law implies the corresponding Gauss law for the dual
theory. The dual theory is non-local. There is a non-local version of
Yang-Mills theory which is self dual.
