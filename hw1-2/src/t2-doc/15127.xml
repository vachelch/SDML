Solitons and Instantons with(out) Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We give model-independent arguments, valid in nearly any number of spacetime
dimensions, that topological solitons and instantons satisfy Bogomol'nyi-type
bounds and, when these bounds are saturated, satisfy self-duality equations. In
the supersymmetric case, we also show that, in spacetime dimensions greater
than two, theories with topological charges necessarily exhibit extended
supersymmetry, in which the topological charge appears as the central charge.
The significance of our arguments lies in their generality. In the
supersymmetric case, we obtain insight into the contrast observed between
topological charges in 1+1 and higher dimensional models. The centerpiece of
our method is to require that the supersymmetric extension of a generic
(non-supersymmetric) field theory be self-consistent. Our discussion of
supersymmetric extensions is quite detailed, and introduces the notion of the
"associated superfield" to construct such extensions.
