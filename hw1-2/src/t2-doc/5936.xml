Exact Solution of the Three-color Problem on a Random Lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the exact solution of the Baxter's three-color problem on a random
planar graph, using the random-matrix formulation of the problem, given by B.
Eynard and C. Kristjansen. We find that the number of three-coloring of an
infinite random graph is 0.9843 per vertex.
