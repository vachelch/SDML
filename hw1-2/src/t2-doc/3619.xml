S-duality and Canonical Transformations in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The symmetries of the tree level string effective action are discussed. An
appropriate effective action is constructed starting from the manifestly
SL(2,R) invarint form of string effective action introduced by Schwarz and Sen.
The conserved charges are derived and generators of infinitesimal
transformations are obtained in the Hamiltonian formalism. Some interesting
consequences of the canonical transformations are explored.
