Systematic Study of Theories with Quantum Modified Moduli II
</title>

<abstract>
  We complete the process of classifying all supersymmetric theories with
quantum modified moduli. We present all the supersymmetric gauge theories based
on a simple orthogonal or exceptional group that exhibit a quantum modified
moduli space. The quantum modified constraints of theories derived from
s-confining theories are invariant under all symmetries. However, theories that
cannot be obtained by a deformation of an s-confining theory may have
constraints that are covariant, rather than invariant.
