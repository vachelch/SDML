The N=2 vector-tensor multiplet, central charge superspace, and
  Chern-Simons couplings
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new, alternative interpretation of the vector-tensor multiplet
as a 2-form in central charge superspace. This approach provides a geometric
description of the (non-trivial) central charge transformations ab initio and
is naturally generalized to include couplings of Chern-Simons forms to the
antisymmetric tensor gauge field, giving rise to a N=2 supersymmetric version
of the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism.
