Quasibosons

<abstract>
  The similarity of the commutation relations for bosons and quasibosons
(fermion pairs) suggests the possibility that all integral spin particles
presently considered to be bosons could be quasibosons. The boson commutation
relations for integral spin particles could be just an approximation to the
quasiboson commutation relations that contain an extra term. Although the
commutation relation for quasibosons are slightly more complex, it is simpler
picture of matter in that only fermions and composite particles formed of
fermions exist. Mesons are usually referred to as bosons, but they must be
quasibosons since their internal structure is fermion (quark) pairs. The photon
is usually considered to be an elementary boson, but as shown here, existing
experiments do not rule out the possibility that it is also a quasiboson. We
consider how the quasiboson, composite nature of such a photon might manifest
itself.
