The Moduli Space of Many BPS Monopoles for Arbitrary Gauge Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the moduli space for an arbitrary number of BPS monopoles in a gauge
theory with an arbitrary gauge group that is maximally broken to $U(1)^k$. From
the low energy dynamics of well-separated dyons we infer the asymptotic form of
the metric for the moduli space. For a pair of distinct fundamental monopoles,
the space thus obtained is $R^3 \times(R^1\times {\cal M}_0)/Z$ where ${\cal
M}_0$ is the Euclidean Taub-NUT manifold. Following the methods of Atiyah and
Hitchin, we demonstrate that this is actually the exact moduli space for this
case. For any number of such objects, we show that the asymptotic form remains
nonsingular for all values of the intermonopole distances and that it has the
symmetries and other characteristics required of the exact metric. We therefore
conjecture that the asymptotic form is exact for these cases also.
