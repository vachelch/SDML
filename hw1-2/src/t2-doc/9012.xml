Exact Wavefunctions in a Noncommutative Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the nonrelativistic field theory with a quartic interaction on a
noncommutative plane. We compute the four point scattering amplitude within
perturbative analysis to all orders and identify the beta function and the
running of the coupling constant. Since the theory admits an equivalent
description via the N particle Schrodinger equation, we regain the scattering
amplitude by finding an exact scattering wavefunction of the two body equation.
The wave function for the bound state is also identified. These wave functions
unusually have two center positions in the relative coordinates. The separation
of the centers is in the transverse direction of the total momentum and grows
linearly with the noncommutativity scale and the total momentum, exhibiting the
stringy nature of the noncommutative field theory.
