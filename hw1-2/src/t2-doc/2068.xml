Sectors of solutions in three-dimensional gravity and Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the connection between three dimensional gravity with negative
cosmological constant and two-dimensional CFT via the Chern-Simons formulation.
A set of generalized spectral flow transformations are shown to yield new
sectors of solutions. One implication is that the microscopic calculation of
the entropy of the Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole is corrected by
a multiplicative factor with the result that it saturates the
Bekenstein-Hawking expression.
