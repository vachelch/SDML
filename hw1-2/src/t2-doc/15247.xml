M-Theory on Seven Manifolds with G-fluxes
</title>

<abstract>
  We compactify M-theory on seven-manifolds with a warp-factor and G-fluxes on
the internal space. Because of non-zero G-fluxes, we are forced to adopt a
Majorana supersymmetry spinor ansatz which does not have the usual direct
product structure of two lower dimensional Majorana spinors. For the spinor
ansatz that we choose, we find that supersymmetry puts strong constraints on
the internal space namely that it must be conformal to a Ricci-flat
seven-manifold of the form $X^7= X^6 \times X^1$. The holonomy of $X^6$ must be
larger than 1 if the warp-factor is to be non-trivial. The warp-factor depends
only on the $X^1$ direction and is singular. We argue that to avoid this
singularity one has to embed this solution in a Horava-Witten setup and thus
has natural links to much studied brane-world scenarios.
