Self-tuning solution of the cosmological constant problem with
  antisymmetric tensor field
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a self-tuning solution of the cosmological constant problem with
one extra dimension which is curved with a warp factor. To separate out the
extra dimension and to have a self-tuning solution, a three index antisymmetric
tensor field is introduced with the $1/H^2$ term in the Lagrangian. The
standard model fields are located at the $y=0$ brane. The existence
\cite{kklcc} of the self-tuning solution (which results without any fine tuning
among parameters in the Lagrangian) is crucial to obtain a vanishing
cosmological constant in a 4D effective theory. The de Sitter and anti de
Sitter space solutions are possible. The de Sitter space solutions have
horizons. Restricting to the spaces which contain the $y=0$ brane, the
vanishing cosmological constant is chosen in the most probable universe. For
this interpretaion to be valid, the existence of the self-tuning solution is
crucial in view of the phase transitions. In this paper, we show explicitly a
solution in case the brane tension shifts from one to another value. We also
discuss the case with the $H^2$ term which leads to one-fine-tuning solutions
at most.
