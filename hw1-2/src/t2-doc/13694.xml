2D Induced Gravity as an Effective WZNW System
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduced a dynamical system given by a difference of two simple SL(2,R)
WZNW actions in 2D, and defined the related gauge theory in a consistent way.
It is shown that gauge symmetry can be fixed in such a way that, after
integrating out some dynamical variables in the functional integral, one
obtains the induced gravity action.
