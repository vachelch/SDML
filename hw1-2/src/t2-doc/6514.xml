Some quantum analogues of solvable Lie groups
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we analyze the structure of some subalgebras of quantized
enveloping algebras corresponding to unipotent and solvable subgroups of a
simple Lie group G. These algebras have the non--commutative structure of
iterated algebras of twisted polynomials with a derivation, an object which has
often appeared in the general theory of non-commutative rings. In particular,
we find maximal dimensions of their irreducible representations. Our results
confirm the validity of the general philosophy that the representation theory
is intimately connected to the Poisson geometry.
