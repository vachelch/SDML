Modified Weak Energy Condition for the Energy Momentum Tensor in Quantum
  Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The weak energy condition is known to fail in general when applied to
expectation values of the the energy momentum tensor in flat space quantum
field theory. It is shown how the usual counter arguments against its validity
are no longer applicable if the states $|\psi \r$ for which the expectation
value is considered are restricted to a suitably defined subspace. A possible
natural restriction on $|\psi \r$ is suggested and illustrated by two quantum
mechanical examples based on a simple perturbed harmonic oscillator
Hamiltonian. The proposed alternative quantum weak energy condition is applied
to states formed by the action of scalar, vector and the energy momentum tensor
operators on the vacuum. We assume conformal invariance in order to determine
almost uniquely three-point functions involving the energy momentum tensor in
terms of a few parameters. The positivity conditions lead to non trivial
inequalities for these parameters. They are satisfied in free field theories,
except in one case for dimensions close to two. Further restrictions on $|\psi
\r$ are suggested which remove this problem. The inequalities which follow from
considering the state formed by applying the energy momentum tensor to the
vacuum are shown to imply that the coefficient of the topological term in the
expectation value of the trace of the energy momentum tensor in an arbitrary
curved space background is positive, in accord with calculations in free field
theories.
