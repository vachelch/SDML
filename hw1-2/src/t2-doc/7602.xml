The mass of asymptotically anti-de Sitter space-times
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a definition of mass for spacelike hypersurfaces in space-times with
metrics which are asymptotic to the anti-de Sitter one, or to a class of
generalizations thereof. We present the results of gr-qc/0110014 which show
that our definition provides a geometric invariant for a spacelike hypersurface
embedded in a space-time. Some further global invariants are also given.
