Intersection Rules and Open Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  A general rule determining how extremal branes can intersect in a
configuration with zero binding energy is presented. It is derived in a model
independent way and without explicit use of supersymmetry, solving a set of
classical equations of motion. When specializing to M and type II theories, it
is shown that some intersection rules can be consistently interpreted as
boundary rules for open branes ending on other branes.
