N=2 Supersymmetry and Dipole Moments
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive sum rules for the magnetic and electric dipole moments of all
particle states of an N=2 supermultiplet. For short representations, we find
agreement with previously determined N=1 sum rules, while there is added
freedom for long representations (expressed as certain scalar expectation
values). With mild assumptions we find the simple result that the supersymmetry
generated spin adds to the magnetic (electric) dipole moment with strength
corresponding to $g=2$ ($g_e=0$). This result is equally valid for N=1, this
time without any further assumptions.
