Decoherent Scattering of Light Particles in a D-Brane Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the scattering of two light particles in a D-brane background. It
is known that, if one light particle strikes the D brane at small impact
parameter, quantum recoil effects induce entanglement entropy in both the
excited D brane and the scattered particle. In this paper we compute the
asymptotic `out' state of a second light particle scattering off the D brane at
large impact parameter, showing that it also becomes mixed as a consequence of
quantum D-brane recoil effects. We interpret this as a non-factorizing
contribution to the superscattering operator S-dollar for the two light
particles in a Liouville D-brane background, that appears when quantum D-brane
excitations are taken into account.
