Confinement in a Model with Condensate of the Scalar Field
</title>

<abstract>
  The idea of ``soft'' confinement when the lifetime of hadron with respect to
quark-gluon channel of decay is greater or at least of the order of some
characteristic time for our Universe is considered. Within the framework of a
model of three nonlinearly interacting fields the explicit form of an effective
potential is found. It provides the confinement of a massive particle within
the limited region of space by means of constant component of the potential
which arises as a result of reorganization of vacuum of one of the scalar
fields. It is shown that the lifetime of hadron being equal to the age of the
Universe leads to the Higgs boson with the mass m > 63.7 GeV and realistic
self-constant.
