Vacuum polarization in the Schwarzschild spacetime and dimensional
  reduction
</title>

<abstract>
  A massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity and propagating in the
Schwarzschild spacetime is considered. After dimensional reduction under
spherical symmetry the resulting 2D field theory is canonically quantized and
the renormalized expectation values $< T_{a b} >$ of the relevant
energy-momentum tensor operator are investigated. Asymptotic behaviours and
analytical approximations are given for $< T_{a b} >$ in the Boulware, Unruh
and Hartle-Hawking states. Special attention is devoted to the black-hole
horizon region where the WKB approximation breaks down.
