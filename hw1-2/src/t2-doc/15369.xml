R-Current Correlators in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory from Anti-de Sitter
  Supergravity

<abstract>
  We test the conjectured relationship between N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in
four dimensions and IIB supergravity compactified on $AdS_5\times S_5$ by
computing the two- and three-point functions of R-symmetry currents. We observe
that the integral expressions describing the general three-point correlator on
the supergravity side have a structure similar to one-loop triangle diagrams in
N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This allows us to compare the expressions on both
sides of the AdS/CFT correspondence without the technical complications of the
loop integrations. We confirm that the two- and three-point correspondence
arises at only one-loop in the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Higher-point
functions as well as further three-point functions may be analyzed similarly.
