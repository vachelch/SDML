Central Binomial Sums, Multiple Clausen Values and Zeta Values
</title>

<abstract>
  We find and prove relationships between Riemann zeta values and central
binomial sums. We also investigate alternating binomial sums (also called
Ap\'ery sums). The study of non-alternating sums leads to an investigation of
different types of sums which we call multiple Clausen values. The study of
alternating sums leads to a tower of experimental results involving
polylogarithms in the golden ratio. In the non-alternating case, there is a
strong connection to polylogarithms of the sixth root of unity, encountered in
the 3-loop Feynman diagrams of {\tt hep-th/9803091} and subsequently in
hep-ph/9910223, hep-ph/9910224, cond-mat/9911452 and hep-th/0004010.
