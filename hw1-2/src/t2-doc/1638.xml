A non-rational CFT with c=1 as a limit of minimal models
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the limit of minimal model conformal field theories where the
central charge approaches one. We conjecture that this limit is described by a
non-rational CFT of central charge one. The limiting theory is different from
the free boson but bears some resemblance to Liouville theory. Explicit
expressions for the three point functions of bulk fields are presented, as well
as a set of conformal boundary states. We provide analytic and numerical
arguments in support of the claim that this data forms a consistent CFT.
