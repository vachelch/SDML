Integrability in N=2 Gauge Theory: A Proof
</title>

<abstract>
  The holomorphic prepotential of ultraviolet finite N=2 supersymmetric gauge
theories is obtained by a partial twisting of N=1 gauge theory in six
dimensions, compactified on $\IR^4\timesT^2$. We show that Ward identities
for the conserved chiral $\R$-symmetry in these theories generate a set of
constraints on the correlation functions of chiral ring operators. These
correlators depend only on the coordinates of the $T^2$, and the constraints
are analogs of the Knihnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations at the critical
level.
