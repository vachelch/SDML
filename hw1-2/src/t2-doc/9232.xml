String Field Theory in the Temporal Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the string field Hamiltonian for $c=1-\frac{6}{m(m+1)}$ string
theory in the temporal gauge. In order to do so, we first examine the
Schwinger-Dyson equations of the matrix chain models and propose the continuum
version of them. Results of boundary conformal field theory are useful in
making a connection between the discrete and continuum pictures. The $W$
constraints are derived from the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. We also
check that these equations are consistent with other known results about
noncritical string theory. The string field Hamiltonian is easily obtained from
the continuum Schwinger-Dyson equations. It looks similar to Kaku-Kikkawa's
Hamiltonian and may readily be generalized to $c>1$ cases.
