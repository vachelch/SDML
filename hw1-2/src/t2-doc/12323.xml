On the Spectrum of Fluctuations in an Effective Field Theory of the
  Ekpyrotic Universe
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the four-dimensional effective field theory which has been used
in previous studies of perturbations in the Ekpyrotic Universe, and discuss the
spectrum of cosmological fluctuations induced on large scales by quantum
fluctuations of the bulk brane. By matching cosmological fluctuations on a
constant energy density hypersurface we show that the growing mode during the
very slow collapsing pre-impact phase couples only to the decaying mode in the
expanding post-impact phase, and that hence no scale-invariant spectrum of
adiabatic fluctuations is generated. Note that our conclusions may not apply to
improved toy models for the Ekpyrotic scenario.
