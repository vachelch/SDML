Superspace Formulation of Yang- Mills Theory II: Inclusion of Gauge
  Invariant Operators and Scalars
</title>

<abstract>
  In a superspace formulation of Yang-Mills theory previously proposed, we show
how gauge-invariant operators and scalars can be incorporated keeping intact
the (broken) $Osp(3,1|2)$ symmetry of the superspace action. We show in both
cases, that the WT identities can be cast in a simple form
$\frac{\partial\bar{W}}{\partial\theta}=0$.
