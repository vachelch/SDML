Coset Models in Monopole Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a fermionic coset model $G/H$ when the subgroup $H$ is not simply
connected. We show that even when the fermionic zero modes impose selection
rules which alters the values of the correlators, the Virasoro central charge
of the theory results independent of the topological sector.
