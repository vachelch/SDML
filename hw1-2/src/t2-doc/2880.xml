Strings and matrix models on genus g Riemann Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a summary of old work on connections between discrete area preserving
diffeomorphisms, reduced SU(N) Yang-Mills, strings, and the quantum Hall effect
on a Riemann surface of genus g. It is submitted to the archives due to the
interest expressed by colleagues who are currently working on matrix models,
and who could not have access to the proceedings in which the article was
published. The text that follows is the version published in 1991.
