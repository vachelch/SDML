The D0-brane metric in N = 2 sigma models
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the physical metric seen by a D0-brane probe in the background
geometry of an N=2 sigma model. The metric is evaluated by calculating the
Zamolodchikov metric for the disc two point function of the boundary operators
corresponding to the displacement of the D0-brane boundary. At two loop order
we show that the D0 metric receives an $R^2$ contribution.
