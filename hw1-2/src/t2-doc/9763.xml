The generating solution of regular N=8 BPS black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we construct the 5 parameter generating solution of N=8 BPS
regular supergravity black holes as a five parameter solution of the N=2 STU
model. Our solution has a simpler form with respect to previous constructions
already appeared in the literature and moreover, through the embedding
[SL(2)]^3\subset SU(3,3)\subset E_{(7)7} discussed in previous papers, the
action of the U-duality group is well defined. This allows to reproduce via
U-duality rotations any other solution, like those corresponding to R-R black
holes whose microscopic description is given by intersecting D-branes.
