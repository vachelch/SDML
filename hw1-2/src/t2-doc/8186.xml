The super self-dual matreoshka

<abstract>
  In this talk we review the harmonic space formulation of the twistor
transform for the supersymmetric self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The recently
established harmonic-twistor correspondence for the N-extended supersymmetric
gauge theories is described. It affords an explicit construction of solutions
to these equations which displays a remarkable matreoshka-like structure
determined by the N=0 core.
