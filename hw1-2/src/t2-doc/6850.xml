Exact effective action for N=1 supersymmetric theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate nonperturbative effects in N=1 supersymmetric theories and
propose a new expression for the effective action, which correctly reproduces
quantum anomalies and agrees with the transformation law of instanton measure.
Actually the result is a nonperturbative extension of Veneziano-Yankielowitch
effective Lagrangian. The possibility of integrating out the gluino condensate
is discussed.
