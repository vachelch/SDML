Unwinding strings and T-duality of Kaluza-Klein and H-Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  A fundamental string with non-zero winding number can unwind in the presence
of a Kaluza-Klein monopole. We use this fact to deduce the presence of a zero
mode for the Kaluza-Klein monopole corresponding to excitations carrying H
electric charge and we study the coupling of this zero mode to fundamental
strings. We also a describe a T-dual process in which the momentum of a
fundamental string ``unwinds'' in the presence of a H monopole. We use the
coupling of string winding modes to the dyon collective coordinate of the
Kaluza-Klein monopole to argue that there are stringy corrections to the
Kaluza-Klein monopole which are in accordance with T-duality.
