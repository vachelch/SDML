The Kepler problem and non commutativity
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the Kepler problem using a symplectic structure consistent
with the commutation rules of the noncommutative quantum mechanics. We show
that a noncommutative parameter of the order of $10^{-58} \text m^2$ gives
observable corrections to the movement of the solar system. In this way,
modifications in the physics of smaller scales implies modifications at large
scales, something similar to the UV/IR mixing.
