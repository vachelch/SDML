Interacting Intersections

<abstract>
  Intersecting p-branes can be viewed as higher-dimensional interpretations of
multi-charge extremal p-branes, where some of the individual p-branes undergo
diagonal dimensional oxidation, while the others oxidise vertically. Although
the naive vertical oxidation of a single p-brane gives a continuum of p-branes,
a more natural description arises if one considers a periodic array of p-branes
in the higher dimension, implying a dependence on the compactification
coordinates. This still reduces to the single lower-dimensional p-brane when
viewed at distances large compared with the period. Applying the same logic to
the multi-charge solutions, we are led to consider more general classes of
intersecting p-brane solutions, again depending on the compactification
coordinates, which turn out to be described by interacting functions rather
than independent harmonic functions. These new solutions also provide a more
satisfactory interpretation for the lower-dimensional multi-charge p-branes,
which otherwise appear to be nothing more than the improbable coincidence of
charge-centres of individual constituents with zero binding energy.
