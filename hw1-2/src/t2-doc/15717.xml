Exact Description of Black Holes on Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  To test recent ideas about lower dimensional gravity bound to a brane, we
construct exact solutions describing black holes on two-branes in four
dimensions. We find that 2+1 gravity is indeed recovered at large distances
along the brane, although there are significant deviations at smaller scales.
Large black holes appear as flattened "pancakes", with a relatively small
extent off the brane. Black hole thermodynamics is discussed from both the
standpoint of the brane and the bulk. We comment on the analogous black holes
bound to higher dimensional branes.
