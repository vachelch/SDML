Quantum Mechanics on Moduli Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been assumed that it is possible to approximate the interactions of
quantized BPS solitons by quantising a dynamical system induced on a moduli
space of soliton parameters. General properties of the reduction of quantum
systems by a Born-Oppenheimer approximation are described here and applied to
sigma models and their moduli spaces in order to learn more about this
approximation. New terms arise from the reduction proceedure, some of them
geometrical and some of them dynamical in nature. The results are generalised
to supersymmetric sigma models, where most of the extra terms vanish.
