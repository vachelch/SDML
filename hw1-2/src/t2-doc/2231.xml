An elegant solution of the n-body Toda problem
</title>

<abstract>
  The solution of the classical open-chain n-body Toda problem is derived from
an ansatz and is found to have a highly symmetric form. The proof requires an
unusual identity involving Vandermonde determinants. The explicit
transformation to action-angle variables is exhibited.
