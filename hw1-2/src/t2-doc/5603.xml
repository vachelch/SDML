Chiral solitons from dimensional reduction of Chern-Simons gauged
  non-linear Schr\"odinger model of FQHE: classical and quantum aspects
</title>

<abstract>
  The soliton structure of a gauge theory recently proposed to describe chiral
excitations in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect is investigated. A new type
of non-linear derivative Schr\"odinger equation emerges as an effective
description of the system that supports novel chiral solitons. We discuss the
classical properties of solutions with vanishing and non-vanishing boundary
conditions (dark solitons) and we explain their relation to integrable systems.
The quantum analysis is also addressed in the framework of a semiclassical
approximation improved by Renormalization Group arguments.
