Induced charge matching and Wess-Zumino term on quantum modified moduli
  space

<abstract>
  Recently it was proposed that matching of global charges induced in vacuum by
slowly varying, topologically non-trivial scalar fields provides consistency
conditions analogous to the 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions. We study
matching of induced charges in supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theories with quantum
modified moduli space. We find that the Wess-Zumino term should be present in
the low energy theory in order that these consistency conditions are satisfied.
We calculate the lowest homotopy groups of the quantum moduli space, and show
that there are no obstructions to the existence of the Wess-Zumino term at
arbitrary N. The explicit expression for this term is given. It is shown that
neither vortices nor topological solitons exist in the model. The case of
softly broken supersymmetry is considered as well. We find that the possibility
of global flavor symmetric vacuum is strongly disfavored.
