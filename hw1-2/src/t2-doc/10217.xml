Open-String Actions and Noncommutativity Beyond the Large-B Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  In the limit of large, constant B-field (the ``Seiberg-Witten limit''), the
derivative expansion for open-superstring effective actions is naturally
expressed in terms of the symmetric products *n. Here, we investigate
corrections around the large-B limit, for Chern-Simons couplings on the brane
and to quadratic order in gauge fields. We perform a boundary-state computation
in the commutative theory, and compare it with the corresponding computation on
the noncommutative side. These results are then used to examine the possible
role of Wilson lines beyond the Seiberg-Witten limit. To quadratic order in
fields, the entire tree-level amplitude is described by a metric-dependent
deformation of the *2 product, which can be interpreted in terms of a deformed
(non-associative) version of the Moyal * product.
