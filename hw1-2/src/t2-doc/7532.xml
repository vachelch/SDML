Localization of Scalar Fluctuations in a Dilatonic Brane-World Scenario
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive and solve the full set of scalar perturbation equations for a class
of $Z_2$-symmetric five-dimensional geometries generated by a bulk cosmological
constant and by a 3-brane non-minimally coupled to a bulk dilaton field. The
massless scalar modes, like their tensor analogues, are localized on the brane,
and provide long-range four-dimensional dilatonic interactions, which are
generically present even when matter on the brane carries no dilatonic charge.
The shorter-range corrections induced by the continuum of massive scalar modes
are always present: they persist even in the case of a trivial dilaton
background (the standard Randall--Sundrum configuration) and vanishing
dilatonic charges.
