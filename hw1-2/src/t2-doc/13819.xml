Hidden Symmetry of the Racah and Clebsch-Gordan Problems for the Quantum
  Algebra sl_q(2)
</title>

<abstract>
  The Askey-Wilson algebra $AW(3)$ with three generators is shown to serve as a
hidden symmetry algebra underlying the Racah and (new) generalized
Clebsch-Gordan problems for the quantum algebra $sl_q(2)$. On the base of this
hidden symmetry a simple method to calculate corresponding coefficients in
terms of the Askey-Wilson polynomials is proposed.
