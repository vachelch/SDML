Solvable N=(4,4) Type IIA String Theory in Plane-Wave Background and
  D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study various aspects of N=(4,4) type IIA GS superstring theory in the
pp-wave background, which arises as the compactification of maximally
supersymmetric eleven-dimensional pp-wave geometry along the spacelike isometry
direction. We show the supersymmetry algebra of N=(4,4) worldsheet
supersymmetry as well as non-linearly realized supersymmetry. We also give
quantization of closed string and open string incorporating various boundary
conditions. From the open string boundary conditions, we find configurations of
D-branes which preserve half the supersymmetries. Among these we identify D4
brane configurations with longitudinal five brane configurations in matrix
model on the eleven-dimensional pp-wave geometry.
