Higher dimensional extremal black strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the five and six-dimensional black strings within
Einstein-Maxwell theory. The extremal black strings are endowed with the null
Killing symmetry. We study the propagation of Einstein-Maxwell modes in the
extremal black string background by using this symmetry. It turns out that one
graviton is a propagating mode, while both the Maxwell $F$ and
three-form $H$ fields are non-propagating modes. Further we discuss
the stability and classical hair of the extremal black strings.
