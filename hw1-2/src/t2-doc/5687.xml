Star products and deformed oscillators
</title>

<abstract>
  A star-product formalism describing deformations of the standard quantum
mechanical harmonic oscillator is introduced. A number of existing generalized
oscillators occur as particular choises of star-products between the elements
of the ordinary oscillator algebra. Star dynamics and coherent states are
introduced and studied.
