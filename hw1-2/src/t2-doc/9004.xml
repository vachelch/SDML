Varying Fine Structure Constant and Black Hole Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent astrophysical observations suggest that the fine structure constant
$\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$ may be slowly increasing with time. This may be due to an
increase of $e$ or a decrease of $c$, or both. In this article, we argue from
model independent considerations that this variation should be considered
adiabatic. Then, we examine in detail the consequences of such an adiabatic
variation in the context of a specific model of quantized charged black holes.
We find that the second law of black hole thermodynamics is obeyed, regardless
of the origin of the variation, and that interesting constraints arise on the
charge and mass of black holes. Finally, we estimate the work done on a black
hole of mass $M$ due to the $\alpha$ variation.
