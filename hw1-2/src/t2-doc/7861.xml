Quantisation of Conformal Fields in Three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter
  Black Hole Spacetime

<abstract>
  Utilizing the conformal-flatness nature of 3-dim. Anti-de Sitter (AdS_3)
black hole solution of Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli, the quantisation of
conformally-coupled scalar and spinor fields in this background spacetime is
explicitly carried out. In particular, mode expansion forms and propagators of
the fields are obtained in closed forms. The vacuum in this conformally-coupled
field theories in AdS_3 black hole spacetime, which is conformally-flat, is the
conformal vacuum which is unique and has global meaning. This point
particularly suggests that now the particle production by AdS_3 black hole
spacetime should be absent. General argument establishing the absence of real
particle creation by AdS_3 black hole spacetime for this case of conformal
triviality is provided. Then next, using the explicit mode expansion forms for
conformally-coupled scalar and spinor fields, the bosonic and fermionic
superradiances are examined and found to be absent confirming the expectation.
